The best news it's free. Farily similar to the free version of the Flickr upload plugin for Aperture. Without further adieu the download is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/aperture-picasa-plugin/downloads/list">here</a> I cannot really vouch for it's flexibility or utility as I have not had much experience with it yet. I believe it came into existance about two days ago and I have just downloaded it and played with it today.

Enjoy - would love hear if you picasa users find it useful and better yet how it compares to the not free version that has been out there from Ubermind for those of you that own that product.
