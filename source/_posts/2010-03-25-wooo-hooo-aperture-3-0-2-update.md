If you haven't checked your updates today - you might want to. I told you these things would be coming out fast and furious now that the Aperture team is not so busy with the writing Aperture 3 in the first place. We'll have to see what this fixes but I will bet you it is more than the description tells us - like usual.

Ps. What this thing lists is fantastic - upgrade and import of old libraries, the folder hierarchy import issues - faces fixes - wow yea - print presets - finally import of color labels from XMP - yes yes (I was wondering when metadata was going to become useful in multi-app work-flows -more IPTC fixes - yes (look for an upcoming article on this and work-flow if it acutally works the way it should.) Â Probably a bunch of stability/crash funkiness fixes too.
