Yep, another ebook. So soon? Hey I have been working on these for a long time. This eBook covers Aperture organization. There is a good chance that if you are reading this that you may already have the free Aperture Organization PDF that I have made available for about the last year. If so I am not trying to convince you to purchase this one.

I have refined and expanded the coverage of some of the things that I covered in the free version but by no means is there any earth shattering new things. I have added a couple of things and change the way I have presented a few as well. I added some example material that I have been making notes of from people that have given me feedback or had additional questions but this is by no means Â a whole new ball game.

If you have the old one and enjoyed it and feel like sending a couple of bucks my way. Great, it is always appreciated. If you don't that is fine as well, hold on to your first version - it is a collectors item. Decoded that means please do not distribute the old version, it is no longer available. If you don't have the old one or are dying to see what I added you will probably enjoy the new one. I don't want to do so much patting myself on the back just because I put a lot of work into it but I can say that every piece of feedback that I have received on the old version was overwhelmingly positive. Almost 10,000 downloads of the old version, hundreds of emails from fans. In fact that is what motivated me to expand it and cover some other Aperture topics in the eBook format as well. Promises of first born children and such. The new one is better.

Okay what kind of stuff did I add - mostly just tidbits. Like how to deal with the issue that "edit with..." doesn't make the new version the album pick. Things like that. Stuff that I thought was obvious in the first version that was apparently not so obvious. Maybe I added a few more work-flow type things.

Seriously if you understood everything I wrote on organization on this site you don't need it. If you want some of it explained a little differently and all put together in one spot it might be what you are looking for. If you don't have the old Aperture Organization Guide - You need this!
