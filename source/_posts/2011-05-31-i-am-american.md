Yes, you probably know that.

On this memorial day I have to say that. Anyone that reads this that does not quite get it. Let me explain. There is nowhere on earth that is like this. Nowhere as fluid. Yes there are debates and arguments, and conflict but nowhere is there the cohesive belief of freedom, not like this.

I have know many marines, soldiers, pilots. Some of them gone. They are us.

In respect, I salute you.
