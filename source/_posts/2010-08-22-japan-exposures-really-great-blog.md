<a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/2010-006-06-880.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2175" title="2010-006-06-880" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/2010-006-06-880-300x136.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="136" /></a>I know that most readers here are way way more interested in digital work-flow, and gear, and stuff like that but I thought I would share a blog I stumbled onto about 2 months ago and that I find a great read. Not just a one timer but this is one of the very few that are in my RSS feeds. There is a ton of great stuff here and the publisher continues to add new things constantly.

It is platform agnostic - it is not anything vs. anything, no film vs. digital, no Canon vs. Nikon, nada. Just great photography and topics related to photography. I guess one of the reasons that I am so drawn to it is it seems like people still like to make prints and books in Japan. You know how I am about prints and books. It's not a photography until it is on paper. Photography is not a web only exercise from my perspective.

Anyway - <a href="http://www.japanexposures.com/" target="_blank">take a look there really is something for everyone</a> and in a Place where photography seems to be a national sport or pastime, the quality and diversity of the photography will blow you away.
