If I were a real blogger I would go out of my way to set this kind of stuff up. Actually I do go out of my way to set this kind of stuff up but not being tuned in to using it as material for a written piece I don't shoot the bad angles. I only shoot the good ones or at least try to. My really late new years resolution is to take the bad shots and the good shots and try to explain the differences. Not in terms of the image - that's obvious but more in terms of exactly what I was thinking and what actions I actually took to make it better. Now all I got to do is remember to actually do that because it has become so automatic I rarely think about it with any degree of conscious thought.

This is a really stupid example but it happened to be an occasion where I was out shooting anything interesting I could find after getting a sandwich with my new little <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CGSYKS?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002CGSYKS&quot;">E-P1</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB002MUAEX4%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Ddp_olp_new_map%26qid%3D1285429963%26sr%3D8-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">GF-1</a> cameras. This means it was crappy midday light. I stumbled across a really old church in my town - I mean really old built during colonial times. This particular situation wasn't anything special but it hit me like a ton of bricks.

Here is a ho-hum subject - doesn't really matter, it's not important it's an illustration, from the WRONG side.

Now let's step 2 and a half feet to the right - oh, is that the same thing at the same time of day in the same light? Yep.

The light and the subject can be exactly the same but standing 3 feet one way or three feet the other is make or break, do or die. This is true no matter what you shoot. The three feet in this case of where I was standing might not be the deal breaker it may be a 5 minute difference if you are a landscape shooter, it may be a fraction of an inch if you are a people shooter. The point is that a tiny change in perspective, point of view, or lighting angle is the difference between blah and KABOOM.

When I do lighting workshops this is what I try to illustrate no matter what technical crap is on the agenda. I have a couple of lighting setups that help illustrate this with undeniable truth. After learning how the gear works, and the metering should be done, etc, etc. When every one is shooting the same thing in the same light - the differences in the resulting shots are huge. This is when the real light bulb goes off and photographers can really move to the next level. Keep this in mind during your endeavors while wrestling with all the functions and settings on your gear and more in mind when you have some sort of gear inferiority complex.
