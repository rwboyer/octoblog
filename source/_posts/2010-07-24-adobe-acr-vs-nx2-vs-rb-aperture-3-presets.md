Being the ever color vigilant - I noticed something about the updates for the latest greatest ACR (supported versions) on some (not all Nikon NEF files). I am going to show you a camera that is near and dear to my heart and one that now seems to be broken - from my earlier testing and memory - it used to work in ACR 4.5, and 5 - The D200.

Let's take a look at three quick and dirty conversions, first up is the gold standard NX2 rendering daylight WB (not as shot) and Picture Control Standard.

Next up is ACR 5 using the same profiles, and daylight WB applied -updated with the latest updates - ooops what happened?

Finally Aperture 3 with my patented D200 NEF presets and my ultra secret sauce daylight WB preset.

Hmmm - looks like my way is now the winner. Maybe I should work on the presets some more like with curves vs the brightness/contrast sliders and start charging like ten bucks ;-)
