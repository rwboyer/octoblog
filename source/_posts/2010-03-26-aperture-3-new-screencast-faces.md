Okay - so here is something that might surprise you. I am actually using Faces - not to the extent that <a href="http://bergsmavisuals.com/blog/apple-aperture/organization/the-cases-for-faces-in-aperture-3/">Matthew Bergsma</a> is - check him out but I am using it none the less. I still thing Apple has a lot of work to do with the UI but here are my suggestions on some of the ways to use Faces most effectively.

I did this screencast the same day that I did stacks and albums - I decided to release it a little later because I wanted to get some feedback on the first one before putting this out there. I took some suggestions from that you had from the couple that I put up on Places and books and color and incorporated them into stacks and albums. Namely - go slower - use menus instead of shortcuts - etc. My biggest worry was that I was going too slow - heck this one is 20 minutes on Faces but the feedback that I have gotten so far has been positive so here is the Faces screencast.

By all means keep the feedback and suggestions coming - I want to make these as useful as possible. <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/aperture-3-screencasts/">You can get the screencasts here</a>.
