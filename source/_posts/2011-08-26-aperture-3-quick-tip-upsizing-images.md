This question comes up all the time. "Can I upsize the pixel dimensions of an image using Aperture 3?". The SuperSimpleStuffâ„¢ answer is yes. Here's how...
<ul>
	<li>Go to the export version dialog via the file menu or by right clicking the image you would like to upsize.</li>
	<li>Once there choose "edit..." from the export settings preset list.</li>
	<li>Add a new preset in the dialog that pops up.</li>
	<li>Now there are two ways that you specify increased pixel dimensions. The first way is to just specify a percentage number greater than 100%. The second and probably better easier to under stand option is to use the "fit within" option and then specify exactly the number of pixels that you would like on the long side of the image - both numbers can be the same and Aperture will figure out what is the long side.</li>
</ul>
Here is what you are looking for...

The "DPI" setting is not really a whole lot more than allowing other software to understand what the physical target size of the image should be, don't worry about it too much. It doesn't really alter the actual image dimensions in pixels. Some software does use it to understand the intent of the target display size.
