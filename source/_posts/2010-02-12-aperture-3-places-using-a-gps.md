This is for Jason - How to use a handheld GPS and the Aperture 3 Places features to Geotag your images. Here is a quick 30 second clip showing you how stupidly simple it is. It was never "hard" but this is ridiculous.

One word or warning - make sure your GPS saves timestamp information. Mine is flakey - it saves timestamps in the active track log but seems to get rid of them if I "save" that track. It might be Garmin, who knows, I have not had time to investigate it. I just grab the active track off mine anyway.
