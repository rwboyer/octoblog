Yep - UPS guy just came. Not a whole lot to report here but...

The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB003WJR69E%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Ddp_olp_new%26qid%3D1284481941%26sr%3D8-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Panasonic LX5</a> is NOT going back. I can tell you that right now. I bet the farm on it being better handling and more responsive than the LX3 and guess what... I was right. This thing handles EXACTLY like the GF! and seems to focus not only as fast but FASTER. I will test this to make sure but my initial impressions are that it is faster. This is really good for a point and shoot. I will definitely give the full report very soon but I can tell you some very cool things right now.
<ol>
	<li>Great controls for such an itty bitty camera.</li>
	<li>Zoom step option is great. Click the little zoom control one way or another and you have instant 24, 28, 35, 50, 90 - Awesome.</li>
	<li>The manual focus and focus controls in general are unbelievably good. I wish the GF1 and E-P1 operated the same way or at least sort of the same way. More on this later.</li>
	<li>Built in image stabilization exceeds my expectation and give the few shots I made - carelessly - seems to border on greatness.</li>
	<li>Image quality is great at 400 (needs more testing at other speeds)</li>
	<li>Crazy macro capability.</li>
	<li>Fantastic screen.</li>
	<li>Very very solid little camera.</li>
	<li>Did I say the controls were great? How about awesome. Very well thought out. Very useable. I am sure I will find some annoyances and you will hear about them.</li>
	<li>Gorgeous! Beautiful little piece of equipment.</li>
	<li>RAW+JPEG does not lock up the camera. Hooray, I can take another shot IMMEDIATELY. I will push this to it's limits and let you know how it goes.</li>
	<li>The direct access to multiple sets of custom settings via the main dial is a great idea - one of the best things about the GF1. Identical on the LX5.</li>
	<li>New grip design is very comfortable.</li>
	<li>My giant sized hands can operate this thing and it is very very very very small by my standards.</li>
</ol>
Here is the very very first shot I took. Again my patented StupidCrapâ„¢ test target of whatever is in my pocket thrown onto the desk in bad light. Here are the specs - 24mm f/2.0 1/25 ISO 400 no fooling around strait "normal" camera settings across the board. Selected the focus point, made it tiny, jammed the camera up to it and snapped the image.

I will save you the gory full frame let's just look at the 100% crop.

<a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P1000003-big.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2414" title="P1000003-big" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P1000003-big-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>

Good enough? This is the 100% crop - pixel peeping, click on the image and then click on the little icon at the upper right to see all the pixels after having been re-compressed 19 1/2 times. Very cool!

Just as a note both the latest ACR/Lightroom and Aperture RAW converters support the RAW files and my initial impression is that they look worth shooting. Unlike a few years ago with itty bitty cameras. More later
