I rarely do any sort of self-promotion or hard sales pushes for products that I offer here, it's just not my thing. Heck I don't even have any sort of auto linker for a few of the affiliate programs that I participate in. No cookie stuffing, no rows of seizure inducing flashing click-me icons in the sidebar etc. Don't expect things like that anytime soon - just not my style.

Having said that I do want to mention briefly mention a couple of things that do have to do with products I have for sale along with a few updates. Specifically related to things I have changed on the site over the last few weeks. They are not obvious so I thought I would take a minute to explain them.

First - availability and location of my infamous Nikon D7000 presets for Aperture 3. For a very long time I have had these buried inside a post that is almost impossible to find among the dozens of posts I have related to the D7000. This was on purpose as I really wanted to limit distribution of them until I received what I consider an appropriate amount of feedback from people that used them. It's been a long time but I think I have reached that point soâ€¦ [The Nikon Picture Control presets are now available in my tiny little store](http://store.rwboyer.com). 

The feedback I have received about the D7000 presets has been positive and in some cases surprising. I seems that there have been more than a few people that have downloaded them specifically to use with Nikon DSLR's other than the D7000. Guess what - they like them and from some of the results they have shared with me they seem to work just as well with all newer Nikon cameras. Specifically just about anything that came after the Nikon D3100. Namely the Nikon D3100, D3200, D5100, D800, etc. There also have been people that have liked what they do for the D700 as well. I can tell you they will be way off for anything prior to Nikon cameras with *Picture Control* so don't even try them. From what I have seen they do work reasonably well with any Nikon DSLR that has *Picture Control* but are optimized and a little different for cameras made after the D3100.

Running a distant second I have attempted to go through the entire site with a fine toothed comb to weed out any of the old direct paypal links for my Aperture 3 ebooks. When I chucked WordPress out on it's ass at the end of 2011 there was some fallout - and a few people that purchased my eBooks found them through very very old pages that no longer worked properly causing some level of distress - mostly for me as I had to deliver the eBooks manually. After a lot of tedious work, any eBook related pages should now link to the new and officially approved [store](http://store.rwboyer.com) or specific store pages.

We now return to our regularly scheduled programming.
