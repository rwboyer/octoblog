Here is the question - if you were <em>stuck </em>with only one lens of one focal length which one would that be. I am only talking about focal length here in terms of angle of view - not the <em>real</em> focal length. For arguments sake lets discuss this in 35mm equivalent terms since everybody is familiar with that and most software and cameras will do the EXIF conversion for you. I guess the question of both your mind's eye and what you think would be best in some combination of what focal lengths you <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2010/09/25/aperture-3-more-fun-with-metadata/">actually use the most as I mention here as an interesting study</a> for you to do some introspection.

For me - it has got to be a 50mm both in terms of how I feel and the reality that seems to creep into my actual use based on hard numbers, now that I can easily get there. How about you? Feel free to include other very specific conditions that are must haves for you in comments - I am always interested in what people think are essential qualities - like maximum aperture, no-or-low distortion, wonderful bokeh, whatever. Try not to pick lenses that don't exist in reality if you comment...
