Yep I love Nik software. I guess it comes from being introduced to color control points in Nikon/Nik Capture NX. I find most of their products worthwhile if you have a need for local adjustments, color effects filters, the best black and white conversions, noise reduction, and specialized sharpening. Now Nik has entered the HDR game. As usual the list price is outrageous for a plug-in but knowing Nik if HDR is your "thing" their product is probably killer.

As soon as I can get my hands on a copy I will do one of my mini-reviews. As you know i am not an HDR guy but acknowledge that a bunch of photographers out there are, so I thought you might be interested in this. Let's hope it will give the other guys a kick in the pants for some better HDR competition out there in HDR land.
