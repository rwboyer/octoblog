<a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/2000-067-10_1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2109" title="2000-067-10_1" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/2000-067-10_1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>I just wanted to give a quick Thank You to all of you that have given support and feedback about the first couple of Aperture eBooks. I am glad that all of you that have written me have found them worthwhile and more than you expected. I also appreciate all of the ideas and suggestions given regarding future eBooks on Aperture.

Right now I have been working on the next one for the last month and it is pretty slow going. It is dedicated to the Aperture book tool. I am finding this one pretty difficult. I have totally rewritten it once so far. It's pretty difficult to hone in on making the book tool info succinct while being somewhat comprehensive. I hope to get this thing ready to go on air in the next month.

Now for  a tiny little bit of self promotion - I was overwhelmed by the amount of positive feedback I have received so far. Here are just a couple of snippets that did not embarrass me too much.
<blockquote><em>...wanted to let you know that I thought is was great - I learned quiet a few things. Your discussion of stacks and stack picks and album picks was a revelation for me. One thing that I do for family events is print 6x4 prints and I must do a special cropping to this aspect ratio. I have forced Aperture to do this with great effort and pain. Your example of how you do 8x10 cropping was an "ah-ha" moment for me. I found many other useful bits of info as well. I have read a book on Aperture usage and did the lynda.com online training, but your presentation of the material was best. After I hit send on this email, I am going to buy your other ebook based on my great experience with this one. ...</em></blockquote>

<blockquote><em>...I am incredibly impressed with the way you lay out and
communicate Aperture and its many uses.  ... Thank
you for sharing all of your knowledge about Aperture!</em></blockquote>

<blockquote>...<em>Thank you for the wonderful ebooks! I downloaded both of them and really enjoyed reading them. Manuals are great but bori</em><em>ng to read which is why books like yours are needed to make learning experience fun...</em></blockquote>

<blockquote>...<em>thought I would drop you a quick note to express my appreciation of your knowledge and advice.  I still have a great deal to go through on RB Design but have already whipped my Previews into shape and, through the use of blue folders, have my projects nicely organised, finally!</em></blockquote>

<blockquote><em>Derek Story's excellent DVD from </em><em>Lynda.com</em><em> gave me a solid foundation in Aperture but I have since been looking for a source to help with the detail.  ... I also just bought the Apple Pro Training book but probably should have saved myself the money - having had a quick look at this,  for example, there is nothing like the detail in your Managing Previews...</em></blockquote>

Okay okay enough already - Thank you all. Now I have to get back to the darkroom where I am continually humbled by simple particles of silver that are not so generous with the feedback and are much more intolerant and demanding task masters than all of you.
