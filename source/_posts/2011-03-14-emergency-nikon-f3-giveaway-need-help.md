I know this is short notice but an entry just came in for the <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/02/06/nikon-f3-give-away/comment-page-2/#comment-23865">Nikon F3 giveaway</a> that merits my consideration to modify the contest and just declare this person the winner. I did want to put this post out before I decided to see what all of you that follow this blog thought. In no way do I want to disrespect or neglect the people that entered the contest or get anyone upset that is following the contest "just to see what happens".

Here is the deal - A photographer from Japan that regularly shoots film submitted a last minute entry via his PHONE due to no access to the internet from the earthquake. He already has a lens for the camera but no body. As long as I can get a way to get the camera to him I would love to just declare him the winner but need some input here on everyone's thoughts.

If anyone is really upset that I might do this please speak up and let me know your thoughts - Don't worry I will hold another contest I promise. I just need to reorganize it and make sure I have a camera that is in good shape but no time commitment right this second - too much on my mind.

PLEASE COMMENT AND LAT ME KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS.
