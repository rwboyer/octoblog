This is not a lens test it is a quick follow up on something I noted the other day regarding a difference in color rendition between the Olympus micro 4/3 kit lens and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB002IKLJVE%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Ddp_olp_new_map%26qid%3D1284664621%26sr%3D8-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Panasonic 20mm f/1.7</a>, I refuse to use the word pancake, crap I just used it. Okay that is the last time I will use that, whey the heck does everyone want to call lenses pancakes?

Any how - I was right, there is a difference in color rendition. Unless you are OCD on this type of thing you won't notice really. The funny part is that the rendition is only to some colors. Here is a quick and dirty "test" both shot on the E-P1

Frist the Olympus 14-42

Yea, yea - I know the focus is different, and I know there is a slightly different exposure but that is not what I am looking at. These were both shot at a fixed daylight WB with seconds of each other in very consistent lighting color. The hue (not saturation and luminance) the actual hue value is almost identical for the more neutral tones in the straw hat. The difference is in the blues and greens in the ribbons. The hue is massively different to my eyes. As measured it's about 8-10 points more toward blue - in other words cooler.

My personal preference is the Panasonic's color rendering but it doesn't really matter you would never really know if you weren't looking at them side by side. I know you are going to say that this is all in my head but Leica lenses have the same kind of color rendering difference as compared to say a Nikon lens on the same film. Maybe Panasonic is using Leica designed coatings?
