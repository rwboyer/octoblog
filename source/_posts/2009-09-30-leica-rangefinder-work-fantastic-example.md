Not really my taste in the specific treatment of the negatives (this was done on film) but the images are great and as I said a fantastic example. If this is the kind of thing (range and proximity) of things you like to shoot. The M9 or M6 or M3 may be the camera for you. If you are too lazy to process and scan film then definitely the M9. This image is not from the book it is one of my old ones. M6 50 Summicron, Â TMAX 400.
