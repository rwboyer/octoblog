Checkout [short this essay](http://blog.jupo.org/2010/09/28/on-modern-web-development/) written over a year ago on modern web development technologies. The author's technology platform of choice is Python and as web technology goes a year ago is a long time but the thought process is still completely relevant. There are a few points that he does a good job of calmly articulating that are really worth helping business leaders understand.

* A proprietary technology with *vendor* support does **not** mean better or more support than an open source technology. In most cases it is **less** and **worse** support than widely used open source technology platforms.
* The number of developers *familiar* with a particular technology like php or .NET has **nothing** to do with the average quality of particular resources skilled with a technology platform. In fact there maybe an inverse relationship. I have experienced this in various technology platform communities. Example the php/wordpress community vs. the ruby/rails community.

These two concepts have been articulated before by many people for quite a few years but I found the above referenced essay consise, well written, and above all - calm. When involved with conversations around these topics I find myself throwing words around like "idiot" far to frequently.
