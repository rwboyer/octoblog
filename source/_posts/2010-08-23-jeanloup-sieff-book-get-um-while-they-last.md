Some of you probably know that Jeanloup Sieff is one of my inspirations and has been since I was a young photographer in the 80's. His work spans decades and transcends his label as a "fashion photographer". Except for some of the well know iconic people that are in his images that for ever set a time - I feel that his work is as fresh and relevant as it was when it was first made.

I have written quite a bit about him and suggested a book titled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/382284439X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=382284439X">Jeanloup Sieff 40 Years of Photography</a> for those interested in seeing this man's work along with a highly engaging read to boot. Well way back when I mentioned this book I had no idea it was so much money nowadays and issued an apology. Â At the time copies were pushing $500. Well I just happened to look the other day and guess what - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/382284439X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=382284439X">there are a few copies available for $50</a>. At 50 bucks this is a must have for anyone that likes photo books and photographer's monographs.

Check it out.
