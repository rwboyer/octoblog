I still like my [Panasonic LX5](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WJR69E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rbde-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B003WJR69E). This is strange, usually my initial excitement wears off with all of my digital cameras and I come to realize that they are not that much better than my old digital cameras. In fact I usually realize that I really like my film cameras better. Here is a brief summary of why I still like it. Will probably buy a [Fuji X10](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005KBB79C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rbde-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B005KBB79C) soon for a couple of reasons. Namely the viewfinder and the manual zoom combo off/on switch. I don't really expect the images to chage much but we'll see. I just want the *hype* to die down a little so it will come down to normal P&S prices.

* The lens is really good. The Leica branding on it may be a marketing thing but the lens itself is no joke. Sharp, great contrast, unbelievable flare control sans hood. Very useful zoom range of 24mm to 90mm *35e*. Oh and it's fast at f 2.0.
* Small enough that I actually take it with me everywhere.
* Nice looking JPEGs. I use the JPEG 90% of the time. Useful RAW files. I shoot RAW+JPEG all the time even though I only occasionally use a RAW from the LX5. 
* Even being an *old* digital camera, the focus is quick in most situations. In fact this is the first digital P&S that I ever found acceptable in terms of speed. I don't need FPS - I just want it to take the image when I say soâ€¦ and then the next image. Panasonic knows what they are doing with the contrast detect thing.
* Though I don't use it much, the focus tracking is amazing. A special most that keeps track of the targeted subject within the frame. Almost magical. Surprised the crap out of me as I had written it off as useless without even trying it when I first got the camera.
* Let's not forget the optical image stabilization. Absolutely amazing. Better than my Nikons. I can shoot down to 1/4sec wide-ish. Easy. 

Some random samples from recent snapshots. Just happened to have the LX5 with me - not any real projects or anything. The reason for these is not the image - it's the circumstances. Checkout the EXIF if you want to. Incredible.

I just snapped these while helping another photographer with medium format digital on a shoot for a commercial job. Crazy I only used one hand. So - what could be better? There are a couple of things that are minor but overall a great little device and still worlds better than a cell phone camera.

* Don't like power zooms. Too slow and too fiddly even with the preset stop positions like the LX5 has. Hence my interest in the Fuji.
* The little on camera flash sucks (actually all on camera flash sucks) and tends to over expose making things look all digital bad.
* While I like the fact that you can put a viewfinder on it the one that is available makes me sea sick and has poor resolution. Really bad.
* Bigger sensor. Not just for the noise, as that doesn't bother me that much. I just want my images to look like they have some differentiation in depth of field at normal distances.
