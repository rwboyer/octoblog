Hey people,

This is why I could never be a teacher. My head would explode. Maybe I need a cooling rod like the Scorpious guy on Farscape from a few years back, for those of you who are not familiar with the series, Scorpious is a bad guy that has a chamber that unscrews from the side of his head so that he can service rods that cool his brain and stop him from going completely insane. I feel the need for one now.

As I have mentioned, I get about 200 emails a week regarding questions about Aperture and try my best to help those that write in. It's Saturday and I have responded to most of them but....

I really really need some help from you folks with this one. My eyes rolled so far back into my head that I don't know if they will ever go back to normal.

Anyone care to answer this one for me?????????

<em>Some time ago I've found your website, and I enjoy it very much. I find it very interesting and useful.
I have a problem and hope you would be able to help.
I am shooting with a Nikon D2X on Raw format. I used Nikon Viewnx/transfer for importing photos (or iView MediaPro3) and Capture NX2 for editing,
and saved the edited photos again in Raw.
About 3 months ago i have switched from PC to Imac 24" 3.06 GB and bought Aperture 2 software.
I continued importing and viewing files with Nikon Viewnx/transfer, editing with Capture NX2, and saving the edited files in RawÂ  format.
Then I imported the edited Raw files to Aperture 2 as referenced files.
The images I get in Aperture 2 are very different from those I edited in Capture NX2 and those I view in Viewnx (they look darker and "dull").
Imported Tiff and jpeg files do not "suffer" from this problem, and look exactly the same.
Therefor I avoide using my new Aperture 2.
I'd appreciate very much your advise.</em>
