Given that the site is new I am bound to make some mistakes in arranging it. I have received a couple of emails, literally, that gave me some feedback on how confusing it is that Aperture vs. Lightroom posts show up under the Aperture category. So... I changed it. <!--more-->The Aperture vs. Lightroom series of articles now has it's very own brand spanking new category and have been removed from the Aperture menu. I haven't completely fixed it, they still show up under the Lightroom category.Â  If this works better for everybody, I will change it so that all posts show up in only one category and use tags exclusively for cross reference. Let me know what works for you and what doesn't.
