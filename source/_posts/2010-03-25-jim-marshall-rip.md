Never heard of him - check out his photos of rock legends. In my book his images are what photography is all about - fantastic stuff. Heck he is a rock legend himself.

His photos are fantastic journalistic work - you know the kind that transcends just the recording and go into "art". Truly something to aspire to as a photographer. I am sure that you have seen at least a dozen Jim Marshall images even if you have never heard of him before. Definitely a photographer worth studying.

Ps. Jim was a Leica shooter - allegedly the image at the top was his M4. I had this laying around in my files - forget where I picked it up on the net.
