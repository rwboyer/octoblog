Sorry loyal fans for the all day outage - again. Two all day power failures inside a week. This time I was not so lucky. I lost two 500Gig SATA hard drives one of which wasn't backed up all the way. You may have noticed that a bunch of articles have the wrong dates, most of the comments are gone, etc. After replacing some hardware it took me about an hour to repost and rebuild as much as I could. Please if you notice any issues let me know, I doubt that I caught all of them and I know I didn't fix any of the content edits that I have done over the last couple of weeks so any help if you come across things that are whacked would be greatly appriciated. Anyone have a couple of spare 500Gig SATA drives?
