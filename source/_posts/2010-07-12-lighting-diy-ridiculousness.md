Remember way back when I was on a kick highlighting all of the stupidest "how to" stuff that certain nameless profit making web personalities post regarding all the "cheap" things you can do with little lights? I won't go into ranting about how idiotic and NOT cheap this sort of thing is again, I am sure that all of you have heard enough from me on that but I just couldn't pass criticizing this bit of rubbish.

Tell me - does this look like an attractive alternative for a ring light to anyone out there? If so please, please enlighten me as to the rationale where this becomes a brilliant solution instead of a laughable endeavor.
