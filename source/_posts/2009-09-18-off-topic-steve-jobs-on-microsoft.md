I know most of you are Apple users - my logs tell me so. Actually my analytics tells me 92.3% of you are Apple users. Hence I thought you might get a kick out of this while waiting for either the demise of Aperture or the second coming. I saw this about a million years ago on real TV somewhere - isn't YouTube great for finding things you kinda remember you kinda saw once upon a time.

Couldn't have said it better myself - Enjoy.

The funny thing is the you can tell he means way more than just proportional fonts - he just is at a loss for words that the rest of the idiots on the planet might possibly understand.
