<p class="meta">5 Jan 2012 - Another Year Of Technology Disappointment</p>

Another year stuck with Liquid, me I rather use ruby but the pain of maintaining and merging branches of Jekyll into my hacked up code base that uses Haml and Ruby directly with all the wonderfull ruby constructs and varialbles available in layouts and pages. It's just too painful. So moving on to *Octopress*. We'll see how that goes.

Maybe Liquid is not so bad. I am starting to like it with custom Liquid plug-ins. Just maybe I can live with itâ€¦ Some work on the Octopress Rakefile, a couple of custom Liquid plug-ins. Life is not so so bad. Now if Marked works out...

Disks vs. circles? Why am I getting disks on one server and circles as bullets with the exact same CSS?

* CSS is the same
* Code is the same
* Develop inspector shows the same inheritance.
* WTF

Node.js, what a crock. The inmates are running the assylum. This is what happens when you spend way too much time jacking around with manipulating browser internals. Some how you manage to actually convince yourself that this is fun and good. Then you go completely around the bend and start trying to convince *everyone* it's fun and good. Hence we have node.js.

I love cell phones. Now you can be twiddled with constantly by everyone but that's not why I love them. I love them becuase slowly human beings have become accustomed to really bad phone service, audio quality, and having to repeat themselves a million times. This has prepared us for VOIP. Yea.

``` ruby
class MaybeRuby
  def ruby?
    return :true
  end
end
```

Just a test of things in Octopress - I love static site generators. They are the best things since sliced bread.
Amazing.
