It involved getting your hands dirty inside the Apple provided theme files using a text editor. Not hard and certainly not "dangerous" in any way as long as you work on a copy of the theme in your local library folder. Of course there are a ton of things that you can do to customize themes in this way. Heck you can even add a bunch of new image filters if you want.

In the <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2008/11/30/aperture-2-quick-tip-custom-fonts-in-book-themes/">original article</a> I walk you through all of the files and locations that you need to know as well has how to make a copy of the theme you want to modify. You can check those details out to refresh your memory. Well - it seems there are people getting fresh ideas from that post almost two years later - One of our readers, Cathy, actually made a suggestion a day ago or so in that post's comments to do something that I never tried before. I will file this one under you learn something new everyday.

Cathy suggests that modifying the "disableFrameScaleAndRotation" property in the Theme.plist file to "false" is extremely useful in some of the Apple provided themes. She's right. I never really played with this property because I don't really use any themes where this property does anything. Some of the themes however come with prefabricated graphic borders - like "Snapshot". For those themes setting this property to false allows you to resize the photo boxes AND the frame edges along with the photo box when in layout mode.

For those of you that use Apple supplied themes with graphic borders this could be a god send. I see the question of "how to" do this come up all the time on the Apple support forums. Here is the answer.

Thanks Cathy.
