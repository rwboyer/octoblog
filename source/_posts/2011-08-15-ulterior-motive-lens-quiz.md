I don't do a lot of - "<a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/08/12/your-desert-island-lens/">What's your favorite</a>" Â kinds of posts like the one on Friday. I did have a secret evil ulterior motive though. That motive was to gage how many of you photographer folk out there think they could actually live with a 35mm angle of view as a <em>one and only</em> lens. I have a bunch of 35mm lenses, heck I have the best - a Leica 35mm Summicron ASPH. Problem is I tend to live in 50mm land given the choice and I always have the choice with all of my cameras at the moment.

Why I am dwelling on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043RS864/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B0043RS864">Fuji X100</a>. Ever since this thing was announced I have been on again, off again "I gotta get one". Even with the whole Tsunami <em>shortage</em> thing, even with the highway robbery of vendors selling them more than list price, even with all the negative feedback from reality-land, even with trying to talk myself out of it, I still feel the tug... The "I'm a 50 guy" seemed to be working as a way not to buy this camera. I got some confirmation from the quiz that a lot of photographers would prefer living with a 50mm. I also got the numbers that say it's almost a wash and that I <em>should</em> be happy with just a 35mm.

So - why would I get one? I <em>AM</em> a 50 guy. I am more than enraged that dealers crank the price way above what the manufacturer thinks they are worth (which we all know is inflated from the get-go). It's <em>NOT</em> a perfect device. The RAW files are a pain in my already convoluted work-flow. Why Why would I buy one?

Well - I have been ranting and raving at manufacturers for something like this since the dawn of time. Something with a big-ish sensor, a great lens, simple, small, you know - like any of dozens of film cameras from years ago. I should probably put my money where my mouth is and support vendors that try to do this for us. It;s close to what I had in mind if not exactly. I think I will sleep on it a few more days before pulling the "buy now" trigger.

Any of you out there vacillating over the X100? It's not outrageously expensive for a decent camera and lens. I do wish more manufacturers were really in this same game.
