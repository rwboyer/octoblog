I actually tried it out and it works great.

Now I am not a big fan of Twitter. I have an account but don't use it much, I follow exactly one other person (actually a group of people) that posts interesting things and resources from a journalistic point of view, not where they are, and what they are eating, or echoing content free crap about Michael Jackson.

I might actually find a use for this plug-in and Twitter. You can get the <a href="http://www.bluecrowbar.com/software/aperture2twitter/">Twitter for Aperture plug-in here</a>.
