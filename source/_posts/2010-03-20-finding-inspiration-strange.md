<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Instax.jpg"><img title="Instax.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/.thumbs/.Instax.jpg" border="0" alt="Instax.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="94" height="150" align="left" /></a>This image is a scan from daughter No. 1's new camera. The camera is dead simple. No focus control, guess exposure, as in inside, sort of cloudy, sort of not cloudy, and sunny. That is the extent of it. The picture pops out the top. It's small but has a really interesting "look". She loves this thing - the Fuji Instax Mini.

I have to say I do not think that it is a camera or medium for me but... it is a blast and a welcome retreat from complexity. I also have to say that it's not just the lack of complexity - I actually like some of the images a whole lot. Like this one. Why? I don't exactly know. I am going to leave this one up - I may even print it out (she has the original) and let is sit around for a week or a month so that I really think about why I like it so much.

Mind you I will probably not run out an buy an Instax, or an old polaroid and load it up with Fuji instant film for my next project but I am going to think really really hard about why I like this image so much and use some of those answers to guide me in my selection of media, materials, and image capture device for some project ideas I have rattling around in my head. I probably won't buy any new stuff - I have far more than I "need" already. I will however probably change a couple of things up from what my usual repertoire or M.O. is.

I will let you know as soon as I digest my feelings for this and am able to articulate this more efffectively.

Thoughts?
