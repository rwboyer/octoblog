Yep, There are some rules that I have figured out. You may not like them but they are so far true as far as I can see. Here they are as plain as day.
<ol>
	<li>You cannot do better than what you are seeing, If it looks fantastic you will get only a tiny bit of that.</li>
	<li>Light cannot be better than what nature has produced, you can try but you will not get far.</li>
	<li>You are only a jerk with a camera and somehow you think you are the only one that can possibly see what you see. You are wrong, everybody sees exactly what you see - you may pay a little more attention to somethings than others and vis-a-vis buy you are no different.</li>
	<li>Your prints on paper will never ever ever be as bright as you saw them. Never.</li>
	<li>Your photos will suck compared to the one in the mind's eye.</li>
	<li>Your mind's eye sucks compared Â to reality.</li>
	<li>No lens, camera, technique, or secret recipe will ever come close to recording exactly what you felt and what you wanted to show anyone else.</li>
	<li>Even if you know all of the above you will still try by all means possible to show just one other person exactly what you saw and felt.</li>
	<li>You have to be insane.</li>
	<li>Even if you hate the world you have to love.</li>
</ol>
Just some food for thought,
