I don't even know where to begin. I don't know who is responsible for this atrocity. I have seen some dogs lately in terms of things that are supposed to be photographs on the cover of Time Magazine but this takes the prize for the most aweful. Is this the art director's fault, is this what he or she wanted?

What the hell is this? It looks like a 5 year old with a point and shoot shot the image and then a 7 year old was plopped in front of Photoshop and given some sort of directions to make it look "better". Is this supposed to be a character portrait? The sad part is this image was probably shot with a massively expensive rig capable of capturing amazing detail, lit with the latest and greatest Profoto gear, proofed on the best technology money can buy and then subjected to death by commitee for even more money and equipment overkill just to end up with something that is not only a terrible photograph by any measure but one that could have been shot with any camera using really bad light and then touched up by the newest Photoshop neophite hack with bad taste in under 30 seconds start to finish.

I must be getting old or everyone else on the planet is getting really dumb. S0mething really bad is happening here. This suck so bad I cannot even believe anyone has the audacity to show this image anywhere let alone on a widely circulated freaking print magazine. Have all of our collective standards and minds gone on permenant vacation?

What the hell am I missing?
