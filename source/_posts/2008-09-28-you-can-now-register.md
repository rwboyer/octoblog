You can now register as a bona fide genuine user at the site. Although I abhor such things, at some point I may require a logged in person to download larger content so I don't get blasted on bandwidth for automated downloaders that don't really even care about what the content is. Don't worry you can use a fake email if you want, just prove that you are a human. Check it out and let me know if a) it works for everybody and b) your thoughts on this policy before I turn it on.
