I wrote yesterday about having a strange nagging desire for another Foveon based camera due to my attraction to the couple images that I shot with that dog of a camera, the DP1s prior to returning it. I knew I would not be getting another one of the DP series cameras as they are <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/01/31/cameras-i-wanted-to-love-but-couldnt/">horrible devices to actually use</a> in more ways than I can articulate. So I was thinking of an SD15, those cameras are below a 1000 bucks new at this point.

As I happen to have about that much laying around that was earmarked for a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042X9LC4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B0042X9LC4">Nikon D7000</a>. I was thinking hey why not the Sigma? Well better judgement got the better of me and I didn't spend the bucks on a camera that I know will be slow, have no high ISO, etc, etc. Instead I found a new in box factory refurbished SD14. Same sensor, just slower, and even less high ISO capability. So instead of spending a thousand bucks, I spent $400.  Hey if I know all of the SD series cameras are slow, low ISO machines why bother putting out the money for a truly inconsequential  bump in speed and ISO/noise capability.

Hmmm, now what am I going to do about lenses. I could by a Nikon mount conversion kit for it. Or an M42 adapter and by like 9 ultra cheap old lenses. That might be the way to go for me on the cheap. Using my considerable powers of rationalization I figured I had $600+ of "found money" that I didn't spend on the camera body that was just begging to be spent on a lens. I ended up grabbing a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dsigma%252050mm%25201.4%2520EX%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%23&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Sigma SA mount 50mm EX 1.4</a> - this should make a great portrait lens as that is what I intend to use this camera for.

I will let you know how it goes - vicarious living through RB...
