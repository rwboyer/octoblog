Here is a really quick tip if you like and want Nik Viveza for Aperture but you don't like the $249.95 price tag. I bought the plug-in for Aperture when it came out because I was already familiar with it from Nikon Capture NX and NX2 (and I like to waste/spend money, actually I try to support companies with my purchases that I really really like). Here is the quick and cheap way to get it with a minor downside, the downside being the real reason that I sprung for the $249.95.<!--more-->

<a href="http://www.niksoftware.com/viveza/usa/entry.php?view=intro/viveza_announcement.shtml">Nik Viveza</a> if you are not familiar with it is about the coolest, quickest way to mask localized adjustments you have ever seen. If you can get used to it, Viveza is a huge time saver. Well here is the deal - it's pretty much built into Nikon Capture NX and NX2. Just grab a copy of the full version of Capture NX2 for one of the rediculously low sale prices of like $119 at Cameta Camera or somewhere else on the web. If you are really cheap you can probably find old versions of NX for even lower but heck at $119 - go with the current version. All you have to do is setup your external editor preferences in Aperture to be NX2 with a 16-bit Tiff and you are in business.

The downside is that if you use CS2/3/4 as an external editor as well you will have to switch your preferences back and forth. The real reason that I reluctantly came up with the $249.95. Hey I told you I am lazy.
