I do not live on the site. These should be pretty good considering I have a D200 and a bunch of images to profile. Here are a few of the Nikon Capture NX2 Picture Control settings for Aperture 3 - for the D200. They are close enough for rock n' roll and should give you a good idea where to start for the Nikon color rendering for this camera. As usual they are FREE. Would love to see what you guys come up with for this camera.

Here is the download Â [download#20]. On another note I have been getting a lot or requests for D300 and D300s presets - no problem but someone sent me ONE file - I think I have that file nailed but really need some diversity so get in touch if you would like these and have a couple more files to send me.
