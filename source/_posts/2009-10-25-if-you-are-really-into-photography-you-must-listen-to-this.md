A couple of times I have lamented the passing of Polaroid Corp. Sure I really miss the materials that I shot, especially Polaroid Type 55 P/N in large format. I even miss the color materials that I of course tried but never really used in any quantities or as an artistic medium. The one thing that never came through in those passing mentions of how sad I was that some of the materials itself are gone was how sad I was that the Polaroid company itself was gone.

Why this makes me sad is a really complicated and difficult issue to describe. Of all the companies related to photography that there are and that were, Polaroid had a very special relationship to photographers and the art of photography that grew up with film. I have had a couple of off-line conversations with some other people that understand this like I do but <a href="http://www.insideanalogphoto.com/inside-analog-photo-radio-20x24-polaroid/272">this interview</a>, especially the second half of it, does a fantastic job of putting the whole thing into words that I could never do.

If you are into photography, like really into it, you need to listen to the <a href="http://www.insideanalogphoto.com/inside-analog-photo-radio-20x24-polaroid/272">interview with John Reuter over on the "Inside Analog Photo Radio" site</a>. Even if you came up and are digital, understanding a little bit of history is a good thing.

Ps. Holy crap - am I turning into some sort of activist or something?

Pss. Sorry for the confusion - I just updated the links to contain the real meat of the interview - the Audi0. The video portion is nice but nothing compared to the audio interview.
