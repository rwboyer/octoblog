Remember the post I put up the other day - you know me whining about the chaotic state of affairs over on that web site. I just had to post a link to this one. Typically this would get my sarcastic snarky treatment but it's Monday and I want to start the week off on the right foot.

This is a perfect example of how NOT to ask a question or ask for assistance - especially on a topic that is probably obvious to anyone that has fired up Aperture for more than 15 seconds. Again - funny stuff.

Ps. I will lay odds that he will not want to do it the way that Aperture works - he will want Aperture to do it in his own special way - whatever that may be.
