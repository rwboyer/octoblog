A scan with no adjustments to black point at full resolution in a non compressed format would kill my server bandwidth for days.How about the next best thing an completely nude except for a conversion to 8bits and save as JPG <code>[download#8#size]</code> . Let us just chalk this up to a grain fetish or something. Have fun.
