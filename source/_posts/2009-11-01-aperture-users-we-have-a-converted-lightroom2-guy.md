In case you have not seen this before, I wanted to share some links to a pair of professional wedding photographers that switched from Lightroom 2 to Aperture 2. Now here is the punch line - THEY ARE NIKON SHOOTERS. Yep, that is right Nikon wedding photographers that switched from Lightroom 2 to Aperture 2.

I know I complain about a couple of nagging things, including NEF conversion and WB handling in Aperture but trust me, if Aperture was not the best tool for workflow and organization and... I would have switched a long time ago. I own both, I know both inside and out. I know how to convert just about everything I care about. One of the things that is becoming more and more clear to me is that photographers that want a really better way of interacting with their libraries as a whole and are very demanding of the environment in which they spend their time prefer Aperture. Especially photographers that have a general bent towards "strait" photography. Photographers that spend lots of time manipulating their images and are satisfied with the file system facilities to organize their images and the work associated with those images seem to prefer Lightroom.

To me Lightroom seems like a smarted up version of Bridge or Bridge a dumbed down version of Lightroom. They have become even closer with CS4.

On to the videos - check them out if you have time.

The other thing that is pretty amazing is that this guy makes his money shooting weddings - not selling Aperture add-ons or education. Aperture users that have seen the light are pretty enthusiastic folks.
