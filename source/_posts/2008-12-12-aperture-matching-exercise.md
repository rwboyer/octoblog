At the end of a long day I checked the download stats on the site and noticed an amazing number of people downloaded the NEF files from the last post. Did anyone try to match the NX2 or NX color renditions (flat color settings or portrait)?

If anyone would like to post the results please do so in comments on this post - may be just a link to the JPG along with your approach in Aperture.
