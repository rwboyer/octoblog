It is still drying. If there is anything remotely reproducible/scannable I will post it in an update. This time around it was 8 year old TRI-X. Fog, and guess what edge burning and general look as though I opened the camera with the film still loaded. This time it is worse.

Could it be that this is the reason that this particular roll went unprocessed? Maybe but I am thinking that the tank that I am using has a light leak because the exposure pattern is the same as that roll of TMZ. After studying the edge burn pattern the evidence is inconclusive but I am changing tanks for the the next run. Â Am I deterred? Nope - I have plenty of really old unprocessed film laying around to make sure my process is back up and running correctly. That and I am curious to see what the heck was on this film that I decided not to<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/badtx100.jpg"><img title="badtx100.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.badtx100.jpg" border="0" alt="badtx100.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="107" align="right" /></a> process it at the time.

I really doubt I pulled the dumb-ass mistake of opening the camera back more than once with film still loaded. It is possible but I think that I would remember that. Stay tuned.
