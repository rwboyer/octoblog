I don't know how many of you track with matters on professional photography, be it art, photojournalism, wedding, portrait, commercial, fashion, event, whatever. I certainly do you see I am interested because I used to produce images for commercial purposes. I am glad I decided to get out when I did. I got out for all the right reasons, meaning I got in for all the wrong reasons. The biggest thing that I did not understand is that I loved photographing things I was interested in and passionate about - not just anything. I really didn't understand this because I never worked at making images of things I wasn't interested in or passionate about. In other words I loved making images of things that I would do even if I weren't getting paid. How different can making images of things you don't give a hoot about be?

Well, much to my chagrin, way way different. I got to the point where I would not and did not ever pick up a camera if I wasn't getting paid. Worse yet I had got to the point where I divorced myself from my image making. I had acquired enough skill to make just about any image (in my commercial field) that anyone else wanted me to make. You see - that's what happens, you make images other people want - not yours. That's why you will find not one commercial image of mine on line anywhere. They are not mine - they are other peoples. Sure I made them but it was more a process of "okay what do you want it to look like, come on come on, hurry up just tell me, okay show me, okay a little like that and sprinkle in some of this, got it" Okay here you go, now give me my check. I had turned a love of making photographs that I wanted to make into a deep jaded cynical business of getting paid to make images that other people wanted. Not a good place to be.

That brings us to the state of the union. Professional photographers of all type bemoan the lack of ability to make a living with a camera. I divide these into two categories - the ones I feel sorry for and the ones I don't. Of course I feel the pain of any person who's livelihood is disrupted to the point where they must do something else. That's not what I am talking about, I'm not a heartless bastard. I would say that the vast majority of those people that can't make a living with a camera are in the same exact boat as any other type of "worker". Just a matter of market forces. Grow up what makes you so special compared to everyone else that has had to adjust to a changing market or market elimination over the ages. Look at all the "professions" that have been decimated and do not really exist any more. You see I know a lot of photographers - I would say a good majority of them are not and have not made a living by making the images they want to make of subjects they want to shoot. There is nothing really different from them than that of say a telegraph operator. Yep you are obsolete, sorry, move on.

Then there are those that I do feel really sorry for on one hand and on the other hand I kind- a have mixed feelings about. These are the very very few photographers that actually happened to make a living as a byproduct of shooting subjects that they really cared a lot about. In other words they would do what they do anyway and just happened to get paid for it. These people I do feel really sorry for more deeply than the previous category. Why? Because they are some of the people that no matter what you do serve as a model for true role models for most human endeavors. Those Â very very few in any profession that are truly at one with the universe and love their "job" because it really is much more than just a way to pay the bills, or get rich, it is their life's work.

On the other hand - how many actually can say that they are that stinking luck to really be doing their life's work every day? So I guess they are in the same boat as the rest of humanity as well, so I guess they should stop whining - find a market or get a couple of other jobs to support what they care about doing.

It took a while and a lot of real soul searching to get my head strait but I am actually slowly, cautiously reemerging photographically. No big leaps of enthusiasm, no epic projects, just dipping my toe in. You see I have a real issue with overcommitting and then not quitting the game until I win. No matter how painful. I guess that is a remnant of my upbringing. While on this journey out of my own personal photographic wasteland and cynicism I have had the opportunity to help some fellow photographers re-invet their market and all of that there has been a common theme. "Why are you doing this?" If the answer has been - to make money it is doomed. The few photographers that I have developed ongoing business relationships with were able to answer that question very differently and gave them a much better idea of how to evolve the business side of their "life's work".

Sorry for the philosophy to you gear-heads out there. I do promise I will keep it balanced with a health dose of gear, how-to, and touchy-feely. Maybe next week will be gear week, all gear, all the time. We all love gear don't we.
