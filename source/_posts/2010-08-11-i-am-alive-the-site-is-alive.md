For all of you that emailed me with concern, for either my site or my wellbeing - thank you. Except for small bursts of rage I am fine. As you probably know the site has been down since freaking FRIDAY!!!, that's like a year in internet time. I guess that is what you get when you try to support the small local guy as hosting/ISP.

As of today the site has been moved to where I host some things for other clients/customers of mine. It should work fine now, and forever more. I hope.

Thank you for your patience, now back to our regular programing. I have about 4 posts ready to go up. If I catch up on everything else you should see them today - or at least this week.
