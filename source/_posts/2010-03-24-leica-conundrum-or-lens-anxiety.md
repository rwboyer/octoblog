I am not at all interested in an M8. Well before I plopped down my hard earned money I decided to shoot for a while with my old film Leica's instead - just to see if I really could justify an M9 purchase.

Guess what - not only have I decided that I do not want an M9 - at least not a $10,000 M9 but I am actually shooting more 35mm film than I am digital for like the last 4 months. Yes I still shoot digital to but I am shooting my M6 cameras more than my digital. I really love these cameras and I really like the way the film looks as well. So for now I am sticking with my film gear in terms of shooting rangefinders.

Based on my advanced rationalization skills acquired through a lot of practice I have determined that I can buy anything I want since I "saved" $10,000 by NOT buying an M9.What I have decided I need is a super-wide for my M cameras. I don't want anything super outrageous like a 15mm - I have a 14mm for my Nikon film and digital bodies that is just fine and a bit too wide for "general purpose". I want a 21mm.

My choices are either a Leica ASPH new - NOT the 1.4 and NOT crappy new budget one - the real one. A brand new Zeiss - again NOT the 1.4 but the small one or... The Voightlander. I have pretty much settled on the Voightlander - it is downright cheap and astoundingly good compared to SLR wide angles but I keep trying to get over the fact that I have only ever used Leica glass on my Leica cameras - I keep having visions of my self HATING every image that the thing pumps out but continuing to use it because it is good enough. I know that this is stupid - but somehow I am having trouble pulling the trigger on the Voghtlander.

Anyone out there have one of these things that can tell me to just go ahead and get the freaking thing already and just be done with it?
