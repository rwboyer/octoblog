Actually 3 bags - you heard me correctly - THREE new bags/cases. If I continue at this pace I will have more cases for things than I actually have things. This is absolutely insane. I am not even talking about camera bags at this point. These are other kinds of bags and cases.

In a day or two the post will see to my doorstep the following three new bags.
<ul>
	<li>This new <a href="http://www.crumpler.com/us/Casual-and-Messenger-Bags/Daypacks-Hydration-Packs/Herbas-S.html?LanguageCode=EN&amp;SKU=HBS002-R00110">Crumpler case that I will try to fit my Macbook Air into</a> - if it doesn't work, I'll send it back.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.crumpler.com/us/Laptop-Bags/Laptop-Messenger-Bags/Moderate-Embarrassment.html?LanguageCode=EN&amp;SKU=MET000-T00130">This Bag is also for my MacBook Air when I want other stuff to</a>. This one is staying as I will probably end up with a 13" Air at some point and all my current laptop+stuff bags are tuned for MacBook Pro 15" laptops. Yes I have a bunch of those as well.</li>
	<li>While I was on a this particular binge I thought I would pick <a href="http://www.jetpens.com/index.php/product/view/products_id/875">this pencil bag up as well</a>. Yes I am on some very strange mailing lists because I am very very particular about buying certain items that I use a lot of and most of what you can find at "normal" places just will not cut it for me. I probably spend about $100/month at this place alone.</li>
</ul>
I am very afraid I need serious help and counseling.
