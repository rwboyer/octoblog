As usual I didn't go more than a few feet from my desk today. Grrrr. I just had to shot a few test shots with the baby camera while going back and forth between the phone, my desk, the coffee pot, and outside for a quick smoke.

Here are just a couple samples from JPEGs of my patented StupidCrap™ series of test subjects. I did setup the camera to function the way I wanted it to but other than that nothing super careful. Some of these I couldn't even see on the LCD because of the position. Not bad for a variety of auto ISO up to 800 a variety of lighting conditions and above all the StupidCrap™ test subjects.
