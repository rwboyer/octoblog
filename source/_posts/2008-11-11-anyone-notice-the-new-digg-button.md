Just added a new feature to the site. The Digg button. Hopefully it's not too obtrusive or obnoxious, the button is located at the very end of each article post, only on the post page itself. Check it out. If you find an article useful, informative, entertaining, or enraging - Digg is an easy way to share it with others along with your own comments.
