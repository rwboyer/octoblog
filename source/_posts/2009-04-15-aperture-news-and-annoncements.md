The latest greatest version is now 2.1.3. I have read a couple of reports that this actually does fix some esoteric issues that some people have been searching for a solution to for quite some time. That is the good news, the bad news is holy crap Apple - can you possibly muster a 2.2 or something that has just a tidbit or two for the Aperture faithful. I want camera profiles like the ACR users have. Maybe a way to drag more than one project around, something, anything. Ah well, I guess I will just amuse myself with the anecdotal "I upgraded and it broke all my stuff" stories that will flood the support boards for the next month or so.<!--more-->

On another note here is something that may keep a few of you entertained in a more productive way. Asuka books have finally released a Mac book tool as of like yesterday or something. For most things I will probably use Aperture books to do the design for Asuka production as I have described in the past but will give the new tools from Asuka a whirl as well. If you are interested you can get the really brand spanking new book tools from Asuka <a href="http://abm.asukabook.com/en/download/index.html">here</a>. Anyone that has let me know what it's like if you have the time, I probably won't have time to really play with it for a while.

Edit - I did get the emails from all of you readers that complained about the lack of a pretty picture at the top of the post - so here it is. On that note I never really noticed that the images in posts were that big of a deal. Anyone that has time let me know what you would like to see here:
