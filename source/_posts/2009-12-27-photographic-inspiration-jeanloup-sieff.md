<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/2002_016_06.jpg"><img title="2002_016_06.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/.thumbs/.2002_016_06.jpg" border="0" alt="2002_016_06.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="120" height="150" align="left" /></a>This guy has been one of my photographic heros since I was a kid. I sought him out after trying to figure out who the heck shot some of the fashion advertising images in magazines that I was blown away with. When I was a late teenager or in my early twenties I read a biography that was available and instantly knew that I identified with his aesthetic and more than that totally got where he was coming from. He remains on my top list even now through a my very jaded perspective.

I find <a href="http://www.jeanloupsieff.com/#">Jeanloup Sieff's</a> images as fresh today as the moment I saw the first one that knocked my socks off. You can see his official website here but like a lot of photographer sites, it is a pain in the ass and is not at all comprehensive of his work. This guy shot for a long long time and is usually recognizable at first glance, his work is diverse and extremely vast. You may be better off just using g<a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;resnum=0&amp;q=jeanloup+sieff&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ei=ubI3S7GJFpCXlAf76vmQBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=image_result_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBwQsAQwAA">oogle image for Jeanloup Sieff</a>.

One more thing - like a lot of fantastic work you have to see the prints - really. Even a well done book on good paper will leave your jaw on the floor.

Enough words - Enjoy!
