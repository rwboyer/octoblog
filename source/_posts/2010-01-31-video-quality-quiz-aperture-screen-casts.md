Anybody that cares to offer an opinion or vote please do so. i just put up another test on YouTube. The question I have is if the 720p quality at full screen is "good enough" to see what is going on in the screen cast video for mini Aperture tutorials?

The other question I had is the pacing - I am trying to go slow enough so that you can see what is going on but not too too slow. I set this one to a song so that I could gauge how fast I was going and so viewers could has well. All comments and suggestions are welcome and appreciated. Again please select 720p in the menu and watch full screen.
