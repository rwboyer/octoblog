Of course I am using Aperture with my new toy cameras the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3DOlympus%2520E-P1%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">Olympus E-P1</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB002MUAEX4%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Ddp_olp_new_map%26qid%3D1284312038%26sr%3D8-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">Panasonic GF1</a>. I wanted to give you Aperture users who are thinking about these cameras or camera users who are thinking about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB002I0JKSS%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dsr_1_1_olp%26s%3Delectronics%26qid%3D1284312275%26sr%3D1-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">Aperture 3</a> a quick and dirty report on RAW file performance for these two little cameras. The bottom line is that I doubt anyone will be unhappy with Aperture 3's default RAW processing.

Of course you will have to setup some presets for your tastes but looking at the RAW files sans adjustments in Aperture 3 from both cameras is a joy. I have shot about 400 images of my patented StupidCrapâ„¢ and have found no horrendous WB issues, No significant hue cross-overs and generally a decent interpretation of color from both the Olympus and Panasonic sensors. The contrast and saturation are not exactly the same as either camera's "neutral" or "natural" settings but are pretty close and above all "pleasing".

I will do a follow up report on thinks like dynamic range etc. as to how worthwhile the RAW files are in the context of Aperture down the road. For now Here are a couple of Aperture 3 default conversions as compared to the out of camera neutral JPG's. These are all from the Panasonic GF1.

I tried to show a variety of color temperature, lighting contrast, and hues from subtle to bold, neutral to primaries. I am not super unhappy with these and the Olympus files look just as good or better from a default RAW decode in Aperture 3. Just a note - ACR 6 did not do as good a job with the default color interpretations. It's not "bad" but there is definitely more of a hue shift on many colors compared to OOC JPEG files and get this Lightroom / ACR fans, the shifts were not in what I would consider a pleasing manner! I will probably do a more detailed analysis and post my findings from a color/detail/noise perspective because you guys/gals no - I just can't help myself even though I will choose the tool overall vs one aspect. I'll share the results soon.
