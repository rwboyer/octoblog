Yes - I shoot film. I have been winding my way through a few long outdated bricks of Kodak Portra 160 VC. Love that stuff. As luck would have it I blew through my last roll this week and was simultaneously elected the event photographer for my communities Fourth of July celebration. Hmmmm...

I figured I would head down to the "local" "Pro" photography shop that is about an hour's drive from my house and grab some of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004V3I6JY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004V3I6JY">new Portra films</a> for the event Monday. Guess what happened. They don't have it. They have a couple rolls of sorry looking outdated non-pro films but that's it. I call around and NOBODY stocks anything I am remotely interested in. Pretty much Fuji - ultra cheapo color neg film only.

I ended up going to Walmart and picked up a 4-pack of el-cheapo buck-a-roll consumer Fuji. Yuk. I have never been enamored with Fuji's consumer films. They really haven't changed much. I could have lived with the NPS stuff or the 400H but not the crappy consumer stuff. The color is just not my cup of tea. I guess I will plan better. To make sure this doesn't happen again I, the moment I got home I ordered the following...
<ol>
	<li>Two pro-packs of Kodak Portra 160 35mm</li>
	<li>Two pro-packs of Kodak Portra 400 35mm</li>
	<li>Same as number 1 and 2 in 120</li>
	<li>Two discount 5 roll bundles of Kodak Ektar 100 in 35mm</li>
	<li>One 5-pack of Fuji 160S just to compare it to the new Portra 160</li>
</ol>
and since I already had fired up the "buy now" clicking muscles in my right index finger I just went ahead and ordered....
<ol>
	<li> One near mint black Nikon FM</li>
	<li>One near mint chrome Nikon FM</li>
	<li>Some motor drive coupling covers for my Nikon F3's that happened to be missing them.</li>
	<li>A BEAUTIFUL Nikkor 135 f2.0 AIS lens.</li>
	<li>and a partridge in a pear tree.</li>
</ol>
I also added a bunch of bargain film gear to my watch list... I will let you know if better judgement prevails or I find myself rescuing these beautiful old metal - brass - enamel - and glass beasts from a life of oblivious to bring them into the sun making photographs again.
