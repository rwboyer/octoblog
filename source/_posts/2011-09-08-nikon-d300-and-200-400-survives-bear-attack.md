And this is why I don't go to Canada.

Actually my buddy Les Picker had his camera rig attacked by a bear when he was out in the wild photographing landscapes, nature, and other subjects that I try to stay as far away from as possible. <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/09/02/close-encounters-of-the-bear-kind/">Here is the full scoop</a>. Neat stuff - not for me. On the other hand he does makes some very very nice images on a regular basis and has just put out a short eBook about some of his landscape images if you are into that kind of stuff. <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/ebook/">Check it out here</a>.

Here is an image of Les that I snapped a few weeks ago while we were out playing around with his large format camera in a stream.

Shot with a Nikon FE, 18mm Nikkor AIS, and crappy consumer grade Fuji 200 for any one that cares. Just as a note - there were no bear during this outing, just poison ivy and some shady looking "gangstas" with pants that didn't fit correctly.

Oh... almost forgot he got back yesterday or the day before and now he is facing a FRIGGIN FLOOD as he lives right on on of the rivers that is causing all kinds of catastrophes and evacuations in the area...
