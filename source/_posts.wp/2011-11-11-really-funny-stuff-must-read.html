Sorry for the foul mood and negativity of my last two posts - that is what dealing with the government does to me. On a lighter note but still on topic relative to not only the last two posts but a lot of the subtext in more than a few of my posts. Here are a few posts that you have to read, if these don't make you chuckle, I don't know what would. File this under funny because you know it's true.

On this post you can skip the mildly pedantic preface where the author (whom I really like) tries to explain how he has <em>never</em> been affected by biases of <em>his</em> generation. Go directly to the end where you will find a faux forum discussion on one of HCB's famous photographs. Hilarious.

Here are some imagined comments on various famous icons of photography and their photographs.

Enjoy
