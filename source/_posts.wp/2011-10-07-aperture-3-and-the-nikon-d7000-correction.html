Okay - so you read my long drawn out bunch of stuff the other day regarding how all of a sudden the Nikon D7000 NEF RAW processing was somehow magically fixed in Aperture 3. Well this is an official retraction of that statement. I was having a very very strange day when I posted that and somehow got a few of my 300 million versions of files that I am working on for the D7000 picture control presets mixed up and re-named.

Long story short - I screwed up. Nothing is fixed in Aperture 3. Same old, same old. That's the bad news. The good news is that I don't have to completely re-do all of my preset work and stand a good chance on getting version 1 of the D7000 Aperture 3 presets out the door this weekend.

Sorry for the confusion and mis-information, my bad.

Back to work...
