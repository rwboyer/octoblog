Aperture 3 is getting close I can feel it. Take a gander at t<a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Apple-Aperture-Workflow-Digital-Photographers/dp/0240521781">his book</a>. It's in english, written by the usual suspects and... You can preorder it right now. This is looking good now. I cannot wait. Not one more second.
