OMG - All the Apple Stores are down - check it. Could this mean we get Aperture 3 today? Maybe some macbook pro upgrades?. Boy oh boy. Â Everybody cross your fingers. Tons of chatter on the web that this is it along with iLife '10. We will see.

Update - I am hearing that some people have official press releases that Aperture 3 is here. I will be updating this page all day today until we know for sure.
