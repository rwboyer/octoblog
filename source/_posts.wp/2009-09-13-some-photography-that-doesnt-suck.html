Okay, my faith is shaken. I have seen way to muck crap lately. Business crap, crap photography, and crap that defies categorization. I was just looking at some fantastic photography that does not suck. Again I am being inspired by a photojournalist but this time with a twist. This guy was covering of all things fashion. Marcus Bleasdale's journalistic images covering the 2009 fashion show scene in europe are downright moving. <a href="http://www.viiphoto.com/showstory.php?nID=1001">Check this out at VII</a>
