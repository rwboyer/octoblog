Yep - he loves it. He has been an Aperture user for a long long long time - almost as long as me. He feels about Aperture 3 the way he felt about the D3. <a href="http://www.joemcnally.com/blog/2010/02/09/aperture-3-was-my-idea/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+joemcnally+%28Joe+McNally%27s+Blog%29">You can read his notes here</a>. He was a beta user and has been using it for months. You will have to wait another day on my first impressions. So take a gander at his not so first impressions.

Ps. There are a couple of bugs - nothing earth shattering yet but a stumble here and there. Subtle, these will get fixed quick in all likelihood.
