<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Leica_M3_technik57ax.jpg"><img title="Leica_M3_technik57ax.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.Leica_M3_technik57ax.jpg" border="0" alt="Leica_M3_technik57ax.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="97" align="left" /></a>Just wanted to point out something that I have been harping on about for the last week - namely buying a film M series rangefinder to check it out prior to buying an M9. Assuming you have never shot one before. I would classify this as a reasonable deal - even if it needs a CLA it would end up being a good deal. This auction ended yesterday or the day before.

Scroll to the bottom to see the actual auction history and images of the item. This is a camera in fantastic shape for the price - not collector shape - who cares. <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=290350914850&amp;ssPageName=ADME:B:WNA:US:1123#ht_3341wt_1035">See it here</a>.
