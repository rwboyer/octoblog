Yea - you all know I still love film and am thinking of making it my primary medium for some up coming "real" work that I am planning on that is a little further from my front door. You also know that I highlight some other "crazy fools" that still shoot the stuff. The thing that surprised me is how many people still shoot film and love using their film gear in the land spews digital photo products 24x7.
