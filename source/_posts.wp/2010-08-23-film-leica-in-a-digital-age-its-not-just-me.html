I ran across a series of posts today about the results of shooting JUST a film Leica with one lens and even if you never intend on doing the Leica thing or the film thing it is a great read. <a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2010/08/a-leica-for-a-year-a-year-later.html">This is a series of comments from people that took that Leica suggestion</a> of shooting a film Leica with one lens for a year (it's now a year or so later). This is the <a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2009/05/a-leica-year.html">original post that make the suggestion</a>, and this.. is <a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2009/05/why-it-has-to-be-a-leica.html">some other commentary </a>along the way.

Enjoy
