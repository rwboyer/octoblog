Just a quick update. Back to the original plan at the urging of Charles. So I went through all the entries, put them in a big pot (metaphorically speaking), and selected the winner at random.

And the winner is...

Gabriel Ponzinelli his website is <a href="http://www.gabrielponzanelli.com/">here</a>.

I have written to Gabriel to confirm a shipping address and assuming he is still interested and alive, the F3 is his. If for some reason I cannot make contact I sill have the pot of entries and will make another selection next week.

So... What should I give away next?
