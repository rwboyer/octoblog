Remember how pissed I was at <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2010/01/21/pdn-is-offering-a-reward-for-pictures-of-aperture-3/">PDN for taking the stance that nobody was waiting on Aperture 3</a>? Well I am right and they were wrong. It is a freaking twitter trending topic - right up there with Haiti and Tiger Woods or whatever celebrity gossip is the news of the day.
