Namely, some people say that I am getting too cranky in my old age. I guess this is true but...

I really need some help in determining if my burning desire to be really really nasty to <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2586239&amp;start=0&amp;tstart=0">this ASSHAT</a> is just my crankiness or did I wake up on the wrong side of bed this morning or should I just give up on trying to participate over on that Aperture forum?

Maybe its just me being overly agitated over how long these 20x30 print files are taking to ftp, that is about the only time I visit that place any more. So maybe I am just pre-cranky-ized. Hmmm.

Seriously - WTF. I have re-read this like 6 times to figure out if I accidentally called him names or something? What am I missing here?
