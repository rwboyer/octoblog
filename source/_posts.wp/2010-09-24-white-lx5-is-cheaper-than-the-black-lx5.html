This is an interesting development. It appears you can get a white <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_ss_i_5_9%26field-keywords%3Dpanasonic%2520lx5%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%26sprefix%3Dpanasonic&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">Panasonic LX5</a> about 50 bucks cheaper than a black LX5. Wonder why that is. Typically the "designer colors" seem to go for a shade more than plain old Model T black. I personally would not buy a white camera. Not because I have some sort of security issue with my manhood but because it most likely would look like crap after a few days of shooting it with my grubby hands.

On the other hand I once had a yellow Hasselblad. Who knows, maybe I can find a way to save more money buy getting a white LX5 to.
