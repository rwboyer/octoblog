If you care to hear me babble on about the <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/02/06/nikon-f3-give-away/">Nikon F3 give-away</a> on a new podcast. <a href="http://filmphotographyforecast.wordpress.com/2011/02/13/episode-4-gordon-cooper-on-rodinal-and-robert-boyers-f3-giveaway/">I am at the very end of the podcast after the Rodinal guy</a>. The produceers are real photography enthusiasts and just started this podcast up so WTH, if you have nothin' better to do check it.

Let me know how I did, it was really early (for me) on Saturday morning via Skype and the built in macbook air mic.
