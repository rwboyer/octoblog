Hmmmm. Let me see. How do I fell about the Apple Pro App announcement today. We get Logic Studio and Final Cut version updates with hundreds and hundreds of new features, probably some Snow Leopard tuning yet to be talked about but probably in there. Wait a second, WTF, what happened to Aperture 3 or 2.5 or 2.2? 

I will tell you how I feel. I feel alone and abandoned and very very angry. Hey I could be a writer - that is three words starting with "A" to describe my feelings. Well maybe not. Anyway why am I not surprised but still a little shocked.
