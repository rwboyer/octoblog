Okay - I have a limited number of images to do these from so they are NOT perfect. Here is my first crack at the D5000 for Picture Control Standard, Neutral, and Landscape. Before I finish any of these cameras I really would like some feedback from people that own the camera. I need to know where they are "off" compared to NX2 or a JPG of the same picture control - NEF example images of where they are off as well.

For your enjoyment and amusement.
