I figured that I would post my response to a thread on the Apple Support forum regarding NEF processing. As most of you Nikon shooters/Aperture users already know, I am usually quite balanced about this issue but today this guy's input (causing my response) caused me to become unglued. I am posting it here because it will be deleted from the Apple forum in about 5 seconds.

Let me ask you this - what is the WB color temp number on the Aperture slider when you say shoot at 6300K? Bet you 17mm bucks it's not 6300K - this is a giant issue for a lot of commercial work that can't even depend on this being correct when you need to match WB exactly (forget individual image adjustments based on "pleasing"  I won't even go into what kind of hassle this is let along across two different camera models. Once you get past this then there are the following issues:
- Gigantic difference in blues - (hue, luminance and saturation) - similar for all NEF's- Red rendition is all over the map - camera to camera, NEF to NEF that is exaggerated by the WB issue (major/minor/or non-existent depending on NEF but still with no rhyme or reason that corresponds to the actual color temp number in the WB control)- Across the board issue with the merging of Yellow and Green for all NEF's that is so bad even I have not been able to solve it with one and only one preset for ANY Nikon RAW file - ever, this may somehow may be related to the inconsistent treatment of Nikon WB?

I could go on with subtile color issues but they are the big ones and THEY FREAKING CHANGE with each Aperture version - grrrrrrr.

I am probably one of the biggest supporters of Aperture on the freaking planet but this is absolutely stupid at this point. I give this thread about 10 seconds until it gets closed down because of what I have said and maybe about 5 seconds with this added:

Ps. He is a regular on the board, shoots Nikon, and sort of replied prior to my post with something like - "What issue, I see no issue, nothing here to see, move along"
