Well both <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/02/01/the-verdict-is-in-i-am-completely-mad-another-bag/">bags</a> came this morning and they are both "nice". I will probably keep the Moderate Embarrassment even though the laptop compartment completely dwarfs Â the 11 inch mackbook air. We'll see. The tiny little one DOES NOT come close to fitting the 11 inch air. It fits side-ways but lengthwise it is a no go. I was hoping since they advertise it with some netbooks. It is going back or... I have to get an iPad for it.
