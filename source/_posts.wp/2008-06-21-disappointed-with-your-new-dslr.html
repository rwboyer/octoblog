That being said it will also hold some truth for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p class="Body">Sharpness, crispness, vividness, whatever you want to call it, If the images from your DSLR seem to be fuzzier, not as sharp, or something along those lines there are a ton of factors that may be contributing to either the reality or your perception of the images versus those shot on your point and shoot. The first thing to talk about is the fact that most point and shoot digicams are much more aggressive than DSLRs in the in-camera sharpening applied. Even with JPGs, DSLRs in general do not apply as much in-camera sharpening to images. There is a good chance that your DSLR has 700 times the detail but the sharpness of the big outlines is not as eye popping. The fix, learn how to do sharpening in post or buy one of the million sharpening plugins. Another thing to look atÂ  is your technique. Point and shoots typically have tiny itty-bitty sensors compared to even APS-C sized sensors of DSLRs. Smaller sensor = shorter focal length for any given angle of view = less depth of field = more focusing screw ups. Camera shake / too slow of a shutter speed is something else that may be showing up way more now. If you bought one of those nifty 18-200 do it all lenses with your new camera realize that you are probably going to need at least 1/300 of a second when zoomed to 200mm to hand hold and that is if you are good at it. If your not count on 1/500, not possible in a lot of circumstances at ISO 100 and f5.6. Other factors may be contrast related but more on that later.<!--more--></p>
<p class="Body">Color. If you donâ€™t like the color your getting with your new camera compared to your old point and shoot there are a couple of things that you may want to look at. The first thing is white balance. Point and shoot cameras can be configured to get accurate white balance but are usually used in the default mode. Camera manufacturers figured out a long time ago that consumers like warmed up images hence most consumer point and shoot cameras produce JPG files that have a white balance that is warm. Most DSLRs are more accurate which is sometimes better and sometimes not. Bottom line if you want warm images you have to do something like set the color temp yourself to get them. Another thing that you may be seeing is that most DSLRs out of the box are set to render â€œaccurateâ€ colors, point and shoots by default pump up the saturation and produce less â€œaccurateâ€ but punchier color out of the box. Easy fix for this, if you shoot JPGs just find the setting on your DSLR to pump up the saturation. If you shoot RAW there are some other things that need to be considered, weâ€™ll get there in a minute.</p>
<p class="Body">Noise.Â  This is very subjective and all over the place depending on brand, model, newness of the DSLR etc. Generally if you are getting noise in your images that you were not seeing in your point and shoot here are a couple things to investigate. First point and shoots apply super aggressive in-camera noise reduction compared to DSLRs, so much so that some point and shoot cameras put out images that look more like a cartoon than a photograph when shot at higher ISOs. Solution - post processing noise reduction. The other thing to look at is to ensure that your main subject is not underexposed, if it is and you are cranking up the â€œexposureâ€ in post you are almost guaranteeing a noisy image. Solution - understand and adapt to your new DSLRs metering and exposure system. In most cases it is way â€œbetterâ€ than your point and shoot, â€œbetterâ€ depends on what you are trying to do.</p>

<div class="paragraph Body">Moving on to exposure. Typically the multi-segment evaluative metering systems employed in DSLRs are optimized to do something way different than they were on your point and shoot. Both of them try to â€œfigure outâ€ what the heck you are trying to take a picture of and then set the exposure properly. They part ways with the contrast in the subject goes off the charts. Point and shoots typically optimize for whatever they thing the subject is and let the highlights go to pure white. DSLRs typically do everything they possibly can to keep the highlights from going pure white while letting significant areas of the image fall into pretty deep shadow. Why do they do this? Because manufacturers assume that point and shoot customers are going to want a cheery bright image of grandmaâ€™s face on the shaded front porch and itâ€™s ok if the background detail is gone. With DSLRs the assumption is that the photographer wants a file that detail can be rescued in the highlights and shadow in post. The photo at the top of this post is a reasonable example of what I am talking about. I shot this while torture testing the metering system, something that is a good idea whenever you get a new camera. Here is another similar torture test.<a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/dsc_9534.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-240" title="dsc_9534" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/dsc_9534.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="100" /></a>See those clouds and the light around them? That is the sun, and hence the light source for the rest of the image, itâ€™s in the frame. See the boats? they are being lit by the sun that is reflecting off of the sky behind me and a little from the ground. As we all know if you include the light source, namely the sun, in the frame you have the choice of either getting completely black subjects in the foreground or getting blown out sky, etc. in the background. Here we have detail in both. The image did not look this way without me tweaking it in post but itâ€™s pretty incredible compared to what I could do with slide film a few years ago. Itâ€™s also pretty incredible that the metering system â€œknowsâ€ so much about the limits of what the sensor can capture. Of course I shot a RAW file so I could use all of the captured informa<a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/dsc_9534-version-2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-241" title="dsc_9534-version-2" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/dsc_9534-version-2.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="100" /></a>tion later. Here is what the JPG looked like with standard processing.

I could have gone even further with the detail in the shadows but wanted to keep somewhat of a feeling of reality to it. If you are shooting JPGs of grandma on the porch with a really bright background there is a good chance that they will be underexposed with your new DSLR. Solution understand the metering system and how it reacts to different lighting conditions or use one of the other metering and exposure modes to get what you want. The other big thing that changed here is the color.Â  This is just a white balance adjustment done in post. With RAW images the white balance is processed after the fact so that it can be infinitely adjusted in post with no loss in image quality. With JPG files the white balance is baked in so minor adjustments are OK but major shifts are not a great idea.</div>

<p class="Body">Last but not least is shooting with RAW. RAW shooting, processing, ins, outs, ups, and downs are a subject for another article but here is some really basic info that will help you to get started without going nuts. If you are using the software that came with your camera to view and process RAW files there is a very good chance that by default your RAW images are going to look exactly like JPGs that you shoot with the same camera using the same settings. If you are using other software to view and process RAW files like Appleâ€™s Aperture, Adobeâ€™s Lightroom, etc., there is a good chance that the initial view of those files will look nothing like JPGs. Even with JPGs captured at the exact same time with RAW+JPG mode. There are a couple of reasons for this. One, as a general rule the manufacturerâ€™s software will read in-camera settings that were applied to the JPG file and do the exact same things to the RAW file. These settings affect tone-curve, contrast, color, etc. Third party software universally ignores most or all of the in-camera image control settings. Two, the default tone curve and contrast will almost always be different with third party RAW software, the same is true for color. Last, in a lot of cases even the white balance information embedded in the RAW file will be processed a little differently in third party RAW processors.</p>
<p class="Body" style="padding-bottom: 0pt;">Hopefully a tidbit or two will help you get going in the right direction to get the most out of your new DSLR.</p>
