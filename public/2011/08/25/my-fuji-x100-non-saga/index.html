<div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/08/12/your-desert-island-lens/">Remember that lens poll from a week or so back that I posted</a>? I already mentioned that I had an ulterior motive - namely my own personal decision on dropping the cash for a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043RS864/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B0043RS864">Fuji X100</a>. I came to a resolution on that matter and I wanted to share my own personal thought process with you as well as how the poll is related in some strange askew way to that decision.</p>

<p>Please do not take this post as any sort of to buy or not to buy kind of advice or wisdom. It&#8217;s not at all that, consider it entertainment or maybe even just a semi-interesting glimpse in to how my whacky gears grind upstairs. As some of you already know I am a master at rationalizing just about any camera gear purchase. Heck if I have the itch I can even convince myself I am somehow saving money no matter how much the purchase. Trust me I have rationalized purchases that are 10x-20x the cost of a puny stinky little X100.</p>

<p>You may be alble to guess where I landed for my own decision. Here is how it rattled around in my head. In the beginning when the X100 was announced I was thinking &#8220;Very cool - just what I want, count me in&#8221;. Large sensor, nice, small, fast, fixed focal length lens, optical viewfinder, looks nice, real controls for the things that matter, looks like I can get strait to the business of making a picture instead of fiddling with computer shit&#8230;</p>

<p>Time goes by, what feels like a long time. Okay come on already where is this freaking thing&#8230; Some more time goes by and it&#8217;s gonna be here any minute now. Oh oh&#8230; WTF, a freaking Tsunami? F&#8217; the G&#8217;Damn Tsunami. Where the hell is the X100? What the F&#8217; is the holdup? I don&#8217;t get it, it&#8217;s not like there are like 4 guys hand screwing these things togehter. This makes no sense.  What the heck is with these Japanese guys - a little wave or something and you can&#8217;t buy stuff? Heck this is America - you should be able to buy stuff day or night as soon as the thought crosses your mind.</p>

<p>More time goes by, now it&#8217;s the summer. Okay looks like a couple people have them now. Time to buy one for me. WTF - I can&#8217;t buy one from anyone I actually trust like right now? Order it? You don&#8217;t have any idea when it will be in? There are how many orders ahead of me? Screw it let me look on eBay or something. Wot? $1500 - are you f&#8217;ing insane? Go to H&#8217;ll.</p>

<p>More time goes by. Hmmm, looks like it&#8217;s either wait or pay about $1400 to these slime-ball scalpers. Let&#8217;s assess the situation:
* Mixed reviews - OVF + close focus and wide open a no go.
* Fantastic image quality - oooooh let me see - oh they mean you can shoot at like 1,000,000 ISO and the NR makes it all like smoooooth. Hmmm not really that special - not mind blowing. I was hoping for decent. I hear mind blowing but it&#8217;s not mind-blowing. It&#8217;s sorta looks real &#8220;digital&#8221; as in all the images look like &#8220;digital&#8221; cameras from a mile a way. Not bad just very &#8220;digital&#8221;. Hmmmm - how come everyone that says the IQ is mindblowing has like ho-hum images? Not in terms of IQ just in terms of I haven&#8217;t seen really really good images as in content? Maybe the camera has bad luck or something.
* Everyones heard all the ups and the downs and the work-arounds and the counterclaims - screw all that the concenscious seems to be that the MF sort blows and the AF is okay but at the end of the day it&#8217;s a &#8220;delibrate&#8221; camera.
* I have been harping that I want a camera sorta like this but this is really more of a half-measure and a high priced one at that. If I don&#8217;t buy one I&#8217;m sorta a hippocrite and not supporting the companies that are almost getting it - I should support them shouldn&#8217;t I? Maybe they&#8217;ll get it right next time, we wouldn&#8217;t want them to go out of business in the meantime would we?
* Ummmm - 35mm focal length? I&#8217;m not so sure - I mean I have one of the planet&#8217;s best 35mm lenses - same aperture f2 but my 50 is the one I reach for way more. Maybe I am on crack and should just go with the 35mm lens is for real men kinda thought process - nobody else is complaining that the fixed lens is not a 50mm.
* Okay let&#8217;s do a poll - if everyone else on the planet says 35mm is the bomb than it&#8217;s gotta be good enough for me and we&#8217;ll just go with it. $1400 - sheeeeshh WTF?
* Hmmm seems a lot of people like a 50mm vs 35mm, more than I expected. Interesting. I guess I am not crazy. We&#8217;ll okay that was just a delay tactic anyway. Let&#8217;s just get on with it and buy one. You didn&#8217;t think the poll was really going to sway me anyway did you?</p>

<p>So as my itchy trigger finger was hovering over the buy it right now button, deciding what highway robber scum-bag to give 1400-1500 bucks to for a MSRP $1199 camera that <em>should</em> be more like $800-$900 at this point in it&#8217;s &#8220;newness factor&#8221; I thought&#8230; &#8220;Hold on one freaking minute here&#8221;, WTF am I doing? It&#8217;s an APS-C digicam that is absolutely not going to have the rendering I desire. It&#8217;s fiddly and digital enough that I am probably going to end up shooting &#8220;I don&#8217;t really care&#8221; images with it anyway - the fate of every little, fiddly, no DOF, digicam I have ever had before. Not only that but the digital fiddly-stuff like AF is really nothing to write home about. $1500 - Go to H&#8217;ll.</p>

<p>Now you may be thinking at this point I will just save my money right? You also may be thinking that I advocate film so much that I am one of those film guys that would never <em>touch</em> digital. Wrong, I will always shoot both. At least for the forseeable future. For me the X100 has too many &#8220;flaws&#8221; for what I really wanted at an insanely high price. Those flaws would relegate it to more of a toy for me. No way. Now unfortunately I had about $1500 laying around ready to get spent on some sort of camera or something.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what happened, I instantly thought, Hey, I don&#8217;t have anything remotely modern to hook to all that great Nikon glass I have for when I want digital images. I sold my D3&#8217;s a while back and they are way way too big anyway. That&#8217;s why I wasn&#8217;t using them. Next thing you know I bought a factory refurbished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042X9LC4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B0042X9LC4">Nikon D7000</a> for about $1000 and had so much money left over that I shipped it overnight.</p>

<p>Now&#8230; What to do with the extra 500 bucks. Maybe I will grab an X100 with it when the price reflects more of the normal digital one year on rot, they should be about that much then. If not - I can still live without it. My film cameras fit what I really wanted in this type of camera far better anyway. Until a digital camera is at least what I want compared to my film cameras at what I consider a fair and reasonable cost for a disposable item I will just be happy. On the APS-C digital side of things, at least the D7000 does that digital auto-stuff about 10,000 times as well for when there is a call for it.</p>
