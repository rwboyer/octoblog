<div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t know how many of you track with matters on professional photography, be it art, photojournalism, wedding, portrait, commercial, fashion, event, whatever. I certainly do you see I am interested because I used to produce images for commercial purposes. I am glad I decided to get out when I did. I got out for all the right reasons, meaning I got in for all the wrong reasons. The biggest thing that I did not understand is that I loved photographing things I was interested in and passionate about - not just anything. I really didn&#8217;t understand this because I never worked at making images of things I wasn&#8217;t interested in or passionate about. In other words I loved making images of things that I would do even if I weren&#8217;t getting paid. How different can making images of things you don&#8217;t give a hoot about be?</p>

<p>Well, much to my chagrin, way way different. I got to the point where I would not and did not ever pick up a camera if I wasn&#8217;t getting paid. Worse yet I had got to the point where I divorced myself from my image making. I had acquired enough skill to make just about any image (in my commercial field) that anyone else wanted me to make. You see - that&#8217;s what happens, you make images other people want - not yours. That&#8217;s why you will find not one commercial image of mine on line anywhere. They are not mine - they are other peoples. Sure I made them but it was more a process of &#8220;okay what do you want it to look like, come on come on, hurry up just tell me, okay show me, okay a little like that and sprinkle in some of this, got it&#8221; Okay here you go, now give me my check. I had turned a love of making photographs that I wanted to make into a deep jaded cynical business of getting paid to make images that other people wanted. Not a good place to be.</p>

<p>That brings us to the state of the union. Professional photographers of all type bemoan the lack of ability to make a living with a camera. I divide these into two categories - the ones I feel sorry for and the ones I don&#8217;t. Of course I feel the pain of any person who&#8217;s livelihood is disrupted to the point where they must do something else. That&#8217;s not what I am talking about, I&#8217;m not a heartless bastard. I would say that the vast majority of those people that can&#8217;t make a living with a camera are in the same exact boat as any other type of &#8220;worker&#8221;. Just a matter of market forces. Grow up what makes you so special compared to everyone else that has had to adjust to a changing market or market elimination over the ages. Look at all the &#8220;professions&#8221; that have been decimated and do not really exist any more. You see I know a lot of photographers - I would say a good majority of them are not and have not made a living by making the images they want to make of subjects they want to shoot. There is nothing really different from them than that of say a telegraph operator. Yep you are obsolete, sorry, move on.</p>

<p>Then there are those that I do feel really sorry for on one hand and on the other hand I kind- a have mixed feelings about. These are the very very few photographers that actually happened to make a living as a byproduct of shooting subjects that they really cared a lot about. In other words they would do what they do anyway and just happened to get paid for it. These people I do feel really sorry for more deeply than the previous category. Why? Because they are some of the people that no matter what you do serve as a model for true role models for most human endeavors. Those Â very very few in any profession that are truly at one with the universe and love their &#8220;job&#8221; because it really is much more than just a way to pay the bills, or get rich, it is their life&#8217;s work.</p>

<p>On the other hand - how many actually can say that they are that stinking luck to really be doing their life&#8217;s work every day? So I guess they are in the same boat as the rest of humanity as well, so I guess they should stop whining - find a market or get a couple of other jobs to support what they care about doing.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/2000-024-25-880.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2274" title="2000-024-25-880" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/2000-024-25-880-300x136.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="136" /></a>I guess I am philosophically thinking about this because this summer is really the first time I can really say that I am out of my photographic funk. It took a while and a lot of real soul searching to get my head strait but I am actually slowly, cautiously reemerging photographically. No big leaps of enthusiasm, no epic projects, just dipping my toe in. You see I have a real issue with overcommitting and then not quitting the game until I win. No matter how painful. I guess that is a remnant of my upbringing. While on this journey out of my own personal photographic wasteland and cynicism I have had the opportunity to help some fellow photographers re-invet their market and all of that there has been a common theme. &#8220;Why are you doing this?&#8221; If the answer has been - to make money it is doomed. The few photographers that I have developed ongoing business relationships with were able to answer that question very differently and gave them a much better idea of how to evolve the business side of their &#8220;life&#8217;s work&#8221;.</p>

<p>Sorry for the philosophy to you gear-heads out there. I do promise I will keep it balanced with a health dose of gear, how-to, and touchy-feely. Maybe next week will be gear week, all gear, all the time. We all love gear don&#8217;t we.</p>
