<div class="entry-content"><p>Yep, No crap. As most parents would be, I am excited and worried all at the same time but I won&#8217;t go into that. I will go into a little bit on how this relates to our collective photographic life. Specifically what to do and how to prepare yourself and the parents to be. Maybe a new camera or lens? What if they aren&#8217;t really that photographically inclined? Maybe but one thing I am sure of is that you cannot ever have enough images of your family. The second thing I am sure of is that it&#8217;s not a bad idea to use film, even if it&#8217;s not your exclusive image capture medium - definitely use it.</p>

<p>Here is an image I recently scanned. It came out of a box of print packs and film envelopes that have been mistreated in major ways. This was one of my reject piles. One of many. With film I never throw anything away - prints or negatives. Especially negatives. My reject boxes are not even remotely organized but at least they exist with contact sheets and occasionally a package of 4x6 prints. I remember why this was a reject. I shot it on Kodak Royal Gold 400. My films of choice were the Kodak Portra family of films but for some reason or another I was always acquiring some sort of promotional film packs from both Fuji and Kodak. I shot them but never really like the way they looked compared to Portra. I happened to shoot some Portra 160NC of this occasion that looked great so I these shots got relegated to the reject pile.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/200000211cn-v2.jpg"></p>

<p>A dozen years later I certainly like the look of even this film (too too warm for my tastes) better than most digital. Especially most digicam images. I was one of the few photographers that I know that shot as much of his kids as I did. You would be surprised at how that gets neglected. I probably have 30,000 or more images of my three daughters on film - both color and black and white. Even after the digital revolution I continued to shoot film when I made images that were important to me and I am glad I did.</p>

<p>This negative looks soooo much better than dgital. It makes a fantastic 13x19 print that is perfect. I just made one. It has depth and color that are really hard to do even today. This is pretty much a strait scan. No fuss no muss. My expectant daughter happens to love photography, not the technical part, more importantly the image taking part and the aesthetic part. A while back <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2010/04/03/check-this-nikon-out-seventy-bucks/">I gave her an beautiful Nikon FM and Â 50 1.4</a>. So what am I going to do to prepare for the arrival of my first grandchild? I am going to keep her well stocked with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FNRTGG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B004FNRTGG">Kodak Portra 400</a> as well as take care of the processing printing and scanning for her. That and insist on her shooting at least 1 roll a week, even if she uses a digicam.</p>

<p>I know from my own experience that upon reflection a lot of the wiz bang wears off with digital. The whole &#8220;look ma, I can look at it at 100% and there is no grain&#8221; effect has no bearing on what the overall photograph looks like. Looking back my film looks far far better - especially in retrospect - than any of my digital of the same vintage. I also know that what images you may like now change a whole lot in 5 or 10 years. It&#8217;s too too easy to delete digital images after glancing at them on your camera or computer. It takes far more effort to cut one negative off a strip to make it go away. Come to think of it, I may even take care of filing negatives for my daughter as well. For her it will be as convenient as digital without the instant turn around. Hey that&#8217;s more fun anyway.</p>

<p>For those that gotta know - the attached image was shot on the way to my daughter&#8217;s dance recital in hand held, using available light with a Nikon F2 and 85 1.4 wide open or at f 2. For you pixel mongers here is the 100% pixel view of a 4000dpi scan (approx. a 6 foot high print). Click to see all the pixels - note there is only a tiny plane that is actually in focus at this large of an Aperture&#8230;.</p>

<p>Please wish my daughters new and growing family luck.</p>
