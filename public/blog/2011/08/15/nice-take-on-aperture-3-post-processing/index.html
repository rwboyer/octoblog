<div class="entry-content"><p>I try to follow the blogs of everyone that I know of or had contact with through this little site of mine. Not just to be nice but there are some DAMN fine photographers out there that actually &#8220;get me&#8221; surprisingly enough. Some of them &#8220;Pro&#8217;s&#8221; some of them just DAMN fine photographers that happen to make money in other ways (probably more profitable). In any case if you haven&#8217;t ever taken the time to checkout some of the links to readers blogs that they provide - be sure to do so. I am pretty sure you will find someone that you will learn something from, be inspired by, or even make friends with - they might be close by.</p>

<p>In any case I just started following Patrick La Roque&#8217;s blog today - must have missed his along the way somewhere. A fellow Aperture user that is taunting me to grab an X100. In any case <a href="http://www.laroquephoto.com/blog/2011/07/14/dissecting-the-look-post-processing-in-aperture-3/">he has a nice post on Aperture 3 post processing that I wanted to share</a> and also to comment on. I agree with everything he says in his take - good ideas all of them along with some unique tips. Especially the ones about reducing some of the contrast/saturation/definition selectively where it might not belong - He doesn&#8217;t say it quite this way but hits on something that is really really good to know - it&#8217;s not about how bright ALL THE COLOR is, or HOW CONTRASTY all of the image is, or HOW DEFINED it all is. It&#8217;s all about how the relationships in the image work to give you an impression. In a lot of cases low saturation image overall with some fantastic color contrast in a particular part will come off as MORE. Just read it.</p>

<p>The thing he brings up that is also worth discussion is a point about how just about everything you see has some sort of post and how most photographers are &#8220;embarrassed&#8221; to show OOC images. I agree - just about everything you see has some (large) degree of post. I am not sure this is a great thing - yes yes - the in camera JPEGs have some sort of &#8220;post&#8221; - heck RAWs have the RAW interpreters &#8220;post&#8221;, yes black and white prints have some sort of &#8220;post&#8221; - etc etc. They do but not to the degree that we all see them once presented to the public. One of the reasons that I am not sure this is a good thing is because when you are looking at images in the context of photographers talking to photographers it&#8217;s not really that clear about the amount of &#8220;post&#8221;. In fact I have complained over and over again about how misleading most of the &#8220;educational&#8221; material out there is when I look at the images associated with the &#8220;education&#8221; that have been clearly &#8220;post processed&#8221; but they are positioned as &#8220;minimal&#8221; or even &#8220;none&#8221;. Â Complete bullshit.</p>

<p>I guess you could rationalize this in saying that &#8220;The audience should understand what is what - they have eyes don&#8217;t they?&#8221;. I think this rationalization is bullshit, especially if the &#8220;education&#8221; is on in-camera technique things such as lighting. The vast majority of photographers out there that will be reading that kind of material does not have a ton of experience in separating what is a lighting effect vs what is a post-processing effect so they follow the recipe exactly as presented and end up with results that look nothing like the author&#8217;s or presenter&#8217;s. They thing they did something &#8220;wrong&#8221; - they attribute it to the wrong things like their camera, their lens, something - when actually it was that &#8220;minimal&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221; post that was actually not - &#8220;none&#8221;.</p>

<p>While I can see the rationale about not showing retail consumers your OOC images if you are &#8220;selling&#8221; that client I think it&#8217;s poppycock not to show photographers that you are trying to &#8220;educate&#8221; either for &#8220;free&#8221; or for profit through workshops, etc. In fact if you already have sold a job to an art director, etc. I think its poppycock not to show them work OOC for their job. I would hate to be &#8220;embarrassed&#8221; by my OOC images. Maybe I come from a time gone by but jesus, whatever happened to showing clients contact sheets that were pretty much &#8220;OOC&#8221; standard C41 or E6 film that was contact printed? God, even in digital I shot tethered so the MUA, art-director, etc could actually help me.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. I think it is far more interesting to see photographers contact sheets and OOC results in many was their work product in a lot of contexts than it is to see the washed-ironed-and-dryed final product. Maybe I depend on the audience here to understand what <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2010/02/17/beater-camera-follow-up-nikon-d2h-the-beast/">OOC results actually look like</a>. They don&#8217;t have to be &#8220;flat&#8221; and &#8220;bad&#8221; of course they can be juiced up and even made &#8220;perfect&#8221; with a little &#8220;minimal&#8221; post but who cares if you are talking about how a camera or lens behaves, talking about shooting, or talking about lighting.</p>

<p>Pss.</p>

<p>Sorry for the rant - read Patrick&#8217;s post.</p>

<p>Psssss.</p>

<p>If you see anything here that is NOT OOC you will know exactly what &#8220;minimal&#8221; was. Please hold me to that as if I miss something I surely intend to be transparent .</p>
