<div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/2001_037_10.jpg"><img title="2001_037_10.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/.thumbs/.2001_037_10.jpg" border="0" alt="2001_037_10.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="120" height="150" align="left" /></a>Before going off to do the Christmas thing I wanted to put a post out there that is sort of a &#8220;note to self&#8221; and an introduction to a series of posts that I will be putting up in the coming year. I have had countless conversations with readers on just about all things photographic. A lot of Apple Aperture stuff, Some Abobe LightRoom things, a PS question or two, cameras, film, lighting, you name it.</p>

<p>The thing that struck me today is that during those conversations we almost inevitably also discuss other photographers, and their photographs as sources of inspiration or aspiration. I am extremely opinionated on this - in terms of my favorites. I respect the work of other photographers as long as it is clear that there was a lot of work put into the work and some degree of competency in their handling of the medium - even if I don&#8217;t find it my cup of tea aesthetically.</p>

<p>That brings me to the new series of posts. I have studied the medium and some of it&#8217;s rock stars, long time artists, lesser know practitioners, for a long time. Since the early 70&#8217;s. Although I have no formal historical education in the subject I can tell you that I have been absorbed and captivated by work throughout the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries. I voraciously consumed everything I could get my hands on. I studied it intently. I have lived with it. Bought countless books of work. Visited museums that allowed access to the actual prints.I thought I might share a couple of photographers that I have really found lasting inspiration from.</p>

<p>There is no strict criteria that I am basing this on. No point system. The genre, treatment, style, and time period may be all over the map. I will present them in no particular order or historical relationship or relevance. Just random bits to be enjoyed, admired, or not. Hey some people are into sports - they like to discuss and debate various games and players throughout history. I am a photography nut so consider this a conversation on the greatest of all time. It is an open discussion so feel free to comment. The nice thing about being a photography nut rather than an avid sports fan is you and I can actually learn something to apply to our craft Â a little more directly than a discussion on Rocky Marciano&#8217;s right hand technique.</p>

<p>If I at first seem to only talk about old fashioned fuddy-duddy photographers fear not. I like a lot of modern photographers work as well. I will tell you that the one and only criteria that I will apply is that it has to last. So I probably won&#8217;t talk a lot about work done by anyone in the last 5 years. I think 5 years is a good criteria to even be able to guess if I will feel the same way about it forever - or at least a long time. I can say this with my own photographs so I do not feel too bad about applying it to other photographers as well.</p>

<p>To kick this off I will present a photographer that doesn&#8217;t get a lot of air time like some of the cliche household name photographers but certainly deserves a look see. If you shoot people you can learn a lot from this guy&#8217;s photographs. I stumbled across a book that I have containing his photographs while looking for a print that I made on a specific Agfa paper to compare to my new paper discovery of the month.</p>

<p>In all his glory - this guy even has his own website so I have to do not much to point you to his work. <a href="http://www.demarchelier.net/home.html">Take a look at Patrick Demarchelier&#8217;s stuff</a>. Don&#8217;t be to quick when you go through it - take some time. I know that is really hard to do on the web. If you like it look for a used book on Amazon for a couple of bucks. The ones I have are very nicely printed and will give you are really good feel for how good his work is (unlike the web).</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>

<p>RB
Ps. I did pick someone relatively current so when I pick some others you won&#8217;t think I am just an old fuddy duddy stuck in in the 20th century</p>
