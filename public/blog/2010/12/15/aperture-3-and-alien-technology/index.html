<div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/P1000845.jpg">I have received about seven hundred and 2 thousand e-mails and one-on-one requests for help with Aperture 3. A lot of them have a two common themes. The first one is -&#8221; help my Aperture 3 has fallen and it can&#8217;t get up&#8221;. The second is - &#8220;How comes you never have no Aperture 3 problems?&#8221;.</p>

<p>With respect to the first theme - of course I will try to help you out if I can. Time goes to one-on-one people on a first come first serve basis. I do have a life - sort of. With respect to the second questions I never really answer that, instead I focus on the way that other people actually operate their own little data-center instead and offer what I consider appropriate suggestions based on a lot of factors.</p>

<p>Today I am going to offer a tiny little bit of the way I operate my little data-center and why I don&#8217;t have no Aperture issues. I am also going to ask readers to answer a very simple question at the end before I go off the deep-end with this kind of stuff.</p>

<p>First off I do have &#8220;Aperture issues&#8221;. Probably not a lot - like most people. The real reason I am not going berserk with any of my application software is because I really don&#8217;t give a hoot when it goes wonky. The reason is simple. No matter what happens, no matter how it happens, no matter if it is the software&#8217;s fault or self inflicted. Under any set of circumstances I can get right back to where I was in less than 5 seconds. That is not hyperbole - it is a conservative estimate, assuming I am drunk and can&#8217;t see strait when I initiate the plan B switch. Under better circumstances it takes me about 2 seconds.</p>

<p>Here is the part were the obvious happens - everyone wants to know how and what I do to achieve that. I am not being stingy because I never talk about my underlying technical infrastructure, I am being responsible. I honestly believe answering that question and writing about what I use and how in bit&#8217;s and pieces of techno-babble and alphabet soup will cause more people disaster than not.</p>

<p>The truth is that most people have no need for anything remotely similar to what I do. The truth is not many people that do have the attention span or time to waste in ever managing to implement what I do at home. If you are an Aperture 3 user that is on a trajectory that is the same as the &#8220;Apple plan&#8221; you are golden - no complicated stuff required. That plan is roughly equivalent to all your stuff fits in a current iMac and the amount you add will easily be overwhelmed with the annual capacity increases that we all see in capacity and speed. It this is you - stick to the way Apple wants you to do things and just get decent gear every year. Timemachine has you covered.</p>

<p>If your data storage needs have already outpaced the &#8220;Apple normal people plan&#8221; you need to do something different. A bunch of people have gone the Drobo route. Some have gone the ga-gillion different libraries on a ga-gillion external hard-drives. This route sucks and I would never go there myself. From my point of view the Drobo expensive and doesn&#8217;t actually do much for the price of entry. I guess it is okay for a very narrow group of people but the reality is the Drobo route is lacking functionality and is still a dead-end hard-stop step function that is EXACTLY like the lots-0-external non-managed drive solution. If you are outpacing single device technology so much so that you NEED a Drobo you need something way different than what you do today. Your life is now complicated.</p>

<p>The answer? Hmmm, there is only one in my hard-headed way of thinking, it&#8217;s a SAN. Any storage area network that is halfway reasonable can do just about anything you ever dreamed of in terms of managing your storage in ways that will seem like &#8220;alien technology&#8221; Really it will - I swear. I have been doing SAN stuff since the mid-90&#8217;s back when the only game in town was IBM ESCON clusters. Nothing ever ever goes awry in a way that the end consumers of the application and data ever actually notice. How about zero down-time and outages from an end-user point of view? It&#8217;s like magic. I swear, you really don&#8217;t want to know how it works, you just want to bask in the glory of a never ending, never down, do-anything with reckless abandon with no worries alien technology and have the confidence that you can be back to where you were with the press of a button - no waiting - NOW.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s the rub? Hmmm. Do you have a full-time big data center guy that deals with this crap for you? No well there&#8217;s the rub. Even the most consumer oriented SAN from say Studio Network Solutions will be daunting to any non-IT type regular people out there. Added on to that obstacle is the cost of entry. You haven&#8217;t really experienced sticker shock until you start pricing this kind of thing out from a traditional SAN vendor like EMC2 or even Studio Network Solutions. Apple used to have there own but it&#8217;s pretty much gone by the wayside as I am sure their typical consumer target market don&#8217;t really &#8220;get it&#8221;. IT-guys already have their preferred recipe and there ain&#8217;t no forking way they are going to mix Apple stuff with their storage network.</p>

<p>That brings us to my point - what do I do? I build my own SAN with all of the capability I want for less than the cost of a Drobo. Really. I also do other crap to my own Macs that I would never ever advise anyone to do that isn&#8217;t already doing it. Here is why you have read this so far. You have a need and maybe I can help. I can and I will. Last week I agreed to build a black-box solution for an Aperture buddy of mine that gives him the capability I have with NO changes to his macs. Sort of plug and play. For the cost of a big Drobo with never ending capacity, instant recovery, cloud replication, and&#8230; performance that will DESTROY ANY SINGLE drive solution. Like 320 MBs write throughput.</p>

<p>I have a couple choices on how I might go forward with the couple of you out there that might also appreciate this kind of thing. One - piecemeal posts on how to roll-your-own. Bad idea - just enough info to spend a bunch of money and be really dangerous. A full scale eBook with every single thing laid out. Hmmm&#8230;. Maybe but still not for the feint of heart. Lastly make the &#8220;black box&#8221; solution available pre integrated with Apple and Aperture and provide support to Aperture users. Well not just me - but some other people as well.</p>

<p>I really really would love to hear what your interests are on this subject before I waste a lot of time on any of these approaches to this topic. If you have come this far please take a couple of seonds to think about this and answer this poll. As usual feel free to question or comment.</p>
