Seems I might be doing film and some of you a disservice in the way I have been presenting some of my film scans according to an astute reader that has a passion for shooting film. I guess my thought was that everybody knows everything about scanning film and what that &#8220;should&#8221; look like vs what an analog print looks like, etc, etc. Well just to make sure I will clarify a couple of things.</p>

<p>First off, the main point of Mr. film advocate was that I was not giving the uninitiated - or for that matter the initiated a good indication of what the sharpness of a final output product should look like because all of my scanned images are presented unsharpened. Yep, he is right. When you scan film even at very high resolution with a good scanner you loose A LOT of sharpness and tonal information. To put that wrong right I will present a couple of images that should show what an output product &#8220;should&#8221; look like. Let me temper this with a couple of qualifications - my taste in &#8220;sharpness&#8221; happens to be about the same no matter what my capture medium and what I am going to present happens to be my taste and pretty much matches the sharpness impression that I get when I print the same negatives at the same sizes on real silver paper using a, believe it or not, enlarger. Your taste may vary - personally I think the overly edge sharpened world we live in at the moment is a visual noise assault but to each his own.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s start with the image at the top of the post - you may have seen this one in my Ilford HP5 developed in pyro post a while back. The image on screen has been sharpened to the same degree that it looks like on paper of about the same size, 7 inches square. How do I know this - I have a chemical print sitting right beside me. So what needs to happen from a sharpening perspective to make a 30&#8221; by 30&#8221; print at 300 ppi on an inkjet printer? I will try to illustrate with two screen shots. When you look at them you might be a little confused because they don&#8217;t look like you expected them to. The first one is the actual pixels in Photoshop.</p>

<p><a onclick="ps_imagemanager_popup(this.href,'sharpen_full_size.jpg','1920','1200');return false" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sharpen_full_size.jpg" onfocus="this.blur()"><img title="sharpen_full_size.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.sharpen_full_size.jpg" border="0" alt="sharpen_full_size.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="94" /></a></p>

<p>A couple of things to note. The grain is not way out of whack with the rest of the image - it is natural. Sometimes this can be a real trick when trying to get the sharpness back into scanned film without exaggerating the crap out of the grain. If this is plaguing your film to digital efforts let me know and I will tell you some of my secrets. Pay special attention to the fabric and the fine vertical line pattern in the shear part of it - that is a crap load of detail that in my opinion is appropriately sharpened and will be visible in the print. In fact the the print will have the same sharpness impression that that little 7&#8221; bugger at the top has - just huge and believe it or not pretty darn smooth in the grain department as well. In fact it will have about the same qualities as a chemical print of the same size from this negative. How do I know - I have made both and compared them as a baseline for what my digital prints &#8220;should&#8221; look like. I will admit that there is a lot of room left for enhancing the sharpness further in the digital print, idiotically so even without introducing artifacts.</p>

<p>So that was what a medium format negative shot with decent equipment on 400 speed film should look like. That is actually a so so negative from a sharpness standpoint mostly due to the fact that I was working quickly and hand-holding the camera at a not so fast shutter speed. The reason it holds up well is that one that it is actually &#8220;not bad&#8221; and two the degree of magnification is not that much compared to say a DX or FX sized image. A similar image on TMAX-100 shot with a tripod will knock your socks off with the same exact treatment. Normal screen sized stuff and prints up to about a foot will be about the same.</p>

<p>I hope that clears things up a bit. Maybe I will do a brief post on sharpening.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Had a conversation with a reader the other day who asked me why I am so down on Photoshop. Hmmm&#8230; I&#8217;m not. I am down on the what passes for a photo today. I am down on Time magazine covers that look downright horrible, like the glamourized Glen Beck. I am down on what I will call image abuse perpetrated via Photoshop. I don&#8217;t write a lot about PS because I think that there are way too many sites about how to screw your perfectly good images up with idiotic photoshop techniques. I also think there are enough really fantastic sites that try to do a good job explaining what a wonderful piece of technology that is PS CS y through z. Enough of the explanation.</p>

<p>Tell you what - as things pop up in my mind that I think may be useful and are not covered 17,000 other places in both competent and incompetent ways I will try and post an article. I will start with a subject that has been covered quite possibly more than any other subject but&#8230; I&#8217;ll do it in a way that I personally have not seen anyone do a really good job on a very powerful and useful set of techniques that are available in almost any recent version of PS. Yep, Masks and Selections. For a lot of people this is extremely painful so let me show you a really great way to deal with masks and selections of specific tonal ranges - this is fantastically useful and uses two of the most underutilized, under-promoted photoshop tools in history. Gradient Maps and Image Calculations. I am not going to show you what to use this for because the range of usefulness is infinite and to tell you the truth I really do not think the typical here is a crappy starting point and a WOW ending point is really that useful.</p>

<p>Follow along if you want, start with any image with any set of adjustment layers that you would like.</p>

<p>At the very top of all the layers add a new gradient map adjustment layer. Â Like so:</p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ps1.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="margin: 10px;" title="ps1.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.ps1.jpg" border="0" alt="ps1.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="94" /></a></p>

<p>The default gradient will be something simple like foreground to background, not terribly useful. This really comes into it&#8217;s own when you add your own color &#8220;stops&#8221; at the bottom. We&#8217;ll add two more just by clicking somewhere at the bottom of the gradient bar.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ps3.jpg"><img title="ps3.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.ps3.jpg" border="0" alt="ps3.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="142" height="150" /></a></p>

<p>Still not real useful but that will change in a second, what we are going to do now is change the color of each of these color stops by double clicking on the little squares at the bottom of each of them. We are dealing with selections and masks so we will be using black and white (000000 and ffffff).</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ps4.jpg"><img title="ps4.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.ps4.jpg" border="0" alt="ps4.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="143" height="150" /></a></p>

<p>As you can see I changed the color stops on the ends to white and the color stops in the middle to black. You can do it the other way around if you want - I just prefer seeing what I am ultimately going to be &#8220;selecting&#8221; in black and gray and what I am not goinging to be selecting as white. This is exactly opposite of the way selections and masks actually work but no worries flip-flopping selections and masks it built in at every stage of the game in Photoshop as you will see. If you prefer not to flip flop just make your end points black and your middle ones white. No big deal. You may start to see where I am going with this. What I am going to do now is drag the middle sliders around to &#8220;select&#8221; Â the mid-tones or what I want to be mid-tones.</p>

<p><a onclick="ps_imagemanager_popup(this.href,'ps5.jpg','1920','1200');return false" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ps5.jpg" target="_blank" onfocus="this.blur()"><img style="margin: 10px;" title="ps5.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.ps5.jpg" border="0" alt="ps5.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="94" /></a></p>

<p>The next step is to play with the end point color stops and/or those little diamonds in the middle of the gradients to make things that you do not want selected absolutely white and to control how much of the selection is &#8220;feathered&#8221; into other tones. That is the grey part.</p>

<p><a onclick="ps_imagemanager_popup(this.href,'ps6.jpg','1920','1200');return false" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ps6.jpg" target="_blank" onfocus="this.blur()"><img style="margin: 10px;" title="ps6.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.ps6.jpg" border="0" alt="ps6.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="94" /></a></p>

<p>Okay now we have an image where all of the stuff I want to deal with, manipulate, lighten, darken, change contrast with - whatever is black and feathered in to all the stuff that I do not what to screw with. Now comes the cool part - let&#8217;s turn it into an alpha channel using the widely not used image calculations (how is that for a sort of double negative oxy-non-moron), it&#8217;s under the image menu - look for it. In the source 1 box we will choose the current document, the layer will be merged, and the channel will be grey. These should all be this way by default but if they are not make sure they are. In my case since I am screwy I will also check the invert box, if you choose your gradient opposite of mine you do not need to do this. In the source two the defaults should be fine - for this example they do nothing - source document is current document, layer is the gradient map layer, and channel is the layer mask - since the layer mask is revealing all kind it makes no difference. Now choose a normal blending mode, opacity 100%, and make sure the mask is not checked. Last but not least Â in the result channel choose new channel.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ps7.jpg"><img title="ps7.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.ps7.jpg" border="0" alt="ps7.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="111" /></a></p>

<p>Okay - now un-eyeball the gradient map layer so you can see the image again - you can leave it there, just don&#8217;t view it. Let&#8217;s say I want to bump up the brightness and contrast of all the crap that we targeted with the gradient map. If you take a look at your channels palette you will see we have a new alpha channel called &#8220;alpha-1&#8221;. Let&#8217;s use it. From the selection menu choose load selection and choose &#8220;alpha-1&#8221; from the channel drop down. After than add a new curves adjustment layer.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ps8.jpg"><img title="ps8.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.ps8.jpg" border="0" alt="ps8.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="83" /></a></p>

<p>What just happened was that since we loaded a selection prior to adding the adjustment layer, we automatically got a layer mask. You could always add it later but I will leave that as an exercise for the reader. Now you can jack around with the curves all you want and will just be affecting the mid-tone selection that we just did. Of course you can use that mask/selection for ANY layer or any photoshop action you would like - are you starting to see the POWER of this technique?</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ps9.jpg"><img title="ps9.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.ps9.jpg" border="0" alt="ps9.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="78" height="150" /></a></p>

<p>Another example - this time a quick one vs. a walk-through. Let&#8217;s say I want clouds in my image instead of a blank august grey-white sky. Okay I will just do what I did above but this time I am going for just the sky pixels. I then use the brush tools to get rid of stray highlights picked up, load an image of clouds, and use my second alpha channel just created as a mask for the clouds.</p>

<p><a onclick="ps_imagemanager_popup(this.href,'ps10.jpg','1920','1200');return false" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/ps10.jpg" target="_blank" onfocus="this.blur()"><img class="alignnone" style="margin: 10px;" title="ps10.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.ps10.jpg" border="0" alt="ps10.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="94" align="left" /></a></p>

<p>Now this is terrible as I would not use these clouds with that image, nor would I consider this image finished, The point is with gradient map and image calculations you can make really complicated tonal based selections and fine tune them using ANY of the other photoshop tools. Yes this works on color images as well. This is by far the one of the most flexible and quick methods dealing with selecting parts of an image based on its tone (as in lightness or darkness) than any thing else out there. I have seen so many really really complicated ways of doing this that offer no benefit whatsoever. Of course there are quicker and easier tools to deal with various tonal issues globally but when you need to be able to mask/select any parts of an image for any other manipulation based on tone - this is the way.</p>

<p>If you followed or understood any of these meanderings you are well on your way to becoming dangerous with Photoshop considering what else you can do with Image calculations and not necessarily white and black gradient maps. For that matter some of you may see a whole new world just guessing what else you can use image calculations for based on the blending mode options and targets other than alpha channels.</p>

<p>If any of you find this type of info useful let me know and Â I will continue to shovel it forth.</p>

Assuming you have never shot one before. I would classify this as a reasonable deal - even if it needs a CLA it would end up being a good deal. This auction ended yesterday or the day before.</p>

<p>Scroll to the bottom to see the actual auction history and images of the item. This is a camera in fantastic shape for the price - not collector shape - who cares. <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=290350914850&amp;ssPageName=ADME:B:WNA:US:1123#ht_3341wt_1035">See it here</a>.</p>

If you don&#8217;t they were meant in jest to educate and amuse. I was shocked that people were finding their way to this site with google keywords &#8220;Ansel Adams Lightroom presets&#8221; - sort of the epitome of missing the whole point of Ansel Adam&#8217;s entire philosophy of making a photograph. Anyway here is the deal, guess how many visits the site has from people that are searching for &#8220;Leica M9 autofocus lens&#8221;. Don&#8217;t bother - let&#8217;s just say a lot. Instead of being sarcastic I thought it may be better to share a couple of rangefinder lessons that I learned along the way and set up a couple of expectations for the uninitiated.</p>

<p>Focusing - you will have to practice but you may also have to try some things that are really way different than you are doing with your current kit. I mentioned somewhere that rangefinders are fantastic for making images of normal sized things that are pretty close to you. Well if you need to be really fast at doing that you may not have time to really really focus precisely. Believe it or not even the most fantastic DSLR autofocus systems are really not that good at dealing with things that are normal size pretty close where you have to take the picture very quickly. <a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/2001_033_14.jpg"><img title="2001_033_14.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.2001_033_14.jpg" border="0" alt="2001_033_14.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="102" height="150" align="right" /></a>So what to do? Well for a lot of situations the best thing to do is pre-focus, just not the way you are thinking. What you may be thinking when I mention pre-focus is to precisely focus on a certain point and wait for the subject to be at that point - this works great for some things and I do it all the time but there is another way as well.</p>

<p>The other way to prefocus is to select an aperture that gives you the depth of field required for your situation and just shoot. Don&#8217;t worry about focusing again until the situation changes. How do you &#8220;know&#8221; when the situation changes - easy you guess. That may sound impossible but it&#8217;s actually really easy. The best way to describe this is to give you an example. Let&#8217;s take a 35mm f2 summicron, the ne plus ultra of street photography everywhere around the world. Let&#8217;s see are we really going to be taking pictures of stuff from closest focus distance to infinity? Nope we are going to be shooting people about 5 feet away give or take. Set your focus distance at 5 feet and your aperture at f8 - cool you now have instant autofocus with no delay for everything you shoot from about 3.5 feet to about 9 feet. How do you know that? <a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/2001_033_21.jpg"><img title="2001_033_21.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.2001_033_21.jpg" border="0" alt="2001_033_21.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="102" height="150" align="left" /></a>Every M series lens has this handy little &#8220;auto focus&#8221; feature built in, it&#8217;s called a depth of field scale. How do you know if your situation changes? Well if you cannot tell the difference between 3 feet and 8 feet you better hang it up. If your situation is different change the lens setting, change the aperture, whatever. This also takes some practice but once you get the hang of it you will not really need 5 feet wide tolerances, you will get by with a 1 or 2 feet tolerances. This is because you will get to know the lens you are using and the image sizes it makes on film for the subjects you shoot at what distances. Old timers call this zone focusing and it is an essential technique for working really really fast with confidence - maybe even faster than auto-focus in a lot of situations.</p>

<p>What about the exposure thing? Well you can use the same sort of idea. Set the exposure and forget about it until the light/situation changes. Done. Again an example is called for - in any giving situation meter the palm of your hand in shadow (turn it away from the light and make sure it is not being filled by your white shirt, or other things that are not going to also fill your subject) set the exposure to about 1 stop less than your meter says (zone iv). Do a quick check of your palm in the light - it should be about 2 to 3 stops more than it was in shadow (zone vi - vii). If this is the case you are golden on both negative and slide film, with slide film you may want to temper it down a bit if the reading is 3 stops more than it was in shadow, with negative film, let it be.<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/2001_033_22.jpg"><img title="2001_033_22.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.2001_033_22.jpg" border="0" alt="2001_033_22.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="102" height="150" align="right" /></a> If you are asking what if the subject gets more light - well the only thing they will get is more fill light like off of a building or a white card - unless your light changes. How do you know if it changes? Look. Are you in the sun? Are you in the shade of a building? Did that change?</p>

<p>I am oversimplifying this a bit - but it is really simple. What&#8217;s more is after a little practice you will actually get MORE consistent exposures that your evaluative vunder meter. The only time the brand new fantastic metering is actually good is if the light is changing really fast (rare) or you have no idea what you are doing. To tell you the truth I actually meter and set my exposure closer to the way I just described most of the time. it is far better than having 400 images of the exact same subject, in the exact same light with exposures all over the map somewhere between a bit over and a bit under at 1/10 of a stop increments just because you changed the framing a bit or the subject turned their head a little bit one way or the other into the shadow or into the light.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/2001_033_19.jpg"><img title="2001_033_19.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.2001_033_19.jpg" border="0" alt="2001_033_19.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="102" height="150" align="left" /></a>Hope this helps people trying to understand what the world would be like without a meter changing the exposure every 1/8000 th of a second and what it might be like without auto-focus. I really hope it helps some of the lost souls searching the inter-webs looking for the long lost Leica M9 auto-focus lens knowing that all of us are just leaving out the auto-focus specs because we are idiots or something.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. The included shots are not supposed to be the best images ever made - they were the first thing that I came across that I happened to use the two set it and forget it techniques just discussed. I just set the scanner to auto and let her rip - I am so lazy I didn&#8217;t even crop off the film holder edges (as usual) or do any fine tuning - I am pretty sure if I spent 10 seconds on contrast/dodge/burn and added some sharpening to deal with what the scanner takes away - you might even be impressed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/2000_027_30.jpg"><img title="2000_027_30.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.2000_027_30.jpg" border="0" alt="2000_027_30.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="left" /></a>Just a real quick post on my long overdue shooting film series, since I have been so big on shooting an M series film camera prior to taking the $9000 plunge for an M9 and meager Leica lens. Here is an old favorite of mine, always appropriate, renders skin tones well - a little too blue sensitive but hey that is what yellow filters were made for. Good ol&#8217; Kodak Plus-X Pan.</p>

<p>This example happens to have been developed in Kodak XTOL, a wunder-developer of the moment a decade and a half ago. To tell you the truth, after extensive testing I never really warmed up to it. I had gigantic consistency issues with XTOL from batch to batch. Saw negligible shadow speed improvements, and nothing really special at all compared to regular old Kodak D-76. Oh the developer was &#8220;non-toxic&#8221; but who cares.</p>

<p>Plus-X on the other hand was a &#8220;nice&#8221; film. I really did not shoot it in smaller formats much as I actually prefer Tri-X so so much more for a million reasons. Here is a pixel for pixel view of Plus-X from a 4000 dpi scan with no hocus-pocus so you can see the structure of the film. At normal enlargements (not the microscopic view you see here) it was very smoooooth but still had a little bite to it.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/2000_027_30_crop.jpg"><img title="2000_027_30_crop.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.2000_027_30_crop.jpg" border="0" alt="2000_027_30_crop.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>

<p>Just for comparison sake here is the same pixel for pixel view of Kodak Tri-X at 4000 dpi - this one was developed in PMK Pyro - a supposedly much &#8220;grainier&#8221; developer. See why Tri-X is my desert island film? I love that stuff, not nearly as &#8220;sharp&#8221; as some other finer, slower films but hey I am not a landscape photographer trying to see detail in tree leaves 14 miles away on a small format camera.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/2000_064_10_crop.jpg"><img title="2000_064_10_crop.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.2000_064_10_crop.jpg" border="0" alt="2000_064_10_crop.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>

<p>Here is the full Tri-X image</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/2000_050_29.jpg"><img title="2000_050_29.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.2000_050_29.jpg" border="0" alt="2000_050_29.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="102" height="150" align="left" /></a>I have had so many conversations with people interested in the Leica M9 I have lost count. Surprising to me is that over half of those people have never shot, owned, or touched any rangefinder camera before. I wanted to offer my advise for those that may be thinking about investing in the Leica M9. It will be short and to the point. There are probably a couple of things in the comments for another post that you may want to take a look at as well.</p>

<p>My very first serious camera was a rangefinder about 30 years ago, so I feel like I am home with the whole way of using them. They are comfortable and quite established in my brain and muscle memory. The do about 95% of what most people need, simply and easily. They are not great for sports - at least not from the sidelines. Forget birds from hundreds of yards away. They are a camera that excels at taking pictures of normal sized things relatively close to you. Maybe the best answer to that subject matter.</p>

<p>Here is the bottom line - before you go and plunk down $7,000 of you hard earned cash on an M9 get a regular old M3, M4, or M6 and a regular old user kind of lens like a 50 f2 summicron. Using these will be so close to using the M9 it is not even funny. If you want something with &#8220;classic&#8221; engraving and gorgeous finishing get an M3, M2, or early M4. Even worn these cameras have an aesthetic appeal that is fantastic. I actually would skip the M4-P or M4-2 because they are actually generally a little more expensive than the previous cameras mentioned, have no real extra &#8220;charm&#8221;, and are not as good a user camera as an M6. If you can spend a little more money just get an M6. They are much more modern in metering, have frame lines for just about everything (28, 75, 135) that may be missing from some of the others, and are every bit as well built. The finish is more durable but if it is worn it is far from &#8220;charming&#8221;.</p>

<p>I have seen M3 and M2 cameras in great shape - I mean fantastic shape in every way, even cosmetically and with a recent CLA go for about $900 regularly. Ugly M2&#8217;s and M3&#8217;s go for even less, they will probably work just fine and produce fantastic pictures, they just have less finish, a couple of dings, and missing vulcanite. I have also seen barely used M6 cameras that most of you would mistake for new (not collectors) for about $1500 - If you are lucky you can find an ugly one that goes for half that. As far as a 50 summicron, the funny thing is the aluminum barreled black lenses of the 1990&#8217;s that are BETTER than older models seem to be about the least expensive - sometimes you can find &#8220;user&#8221; 50 summicrons that are older for a lot less if they have cosmetic issues but if they are only a little less money go with the new one. In any case there are plenty of various vintage summicrons that are fantastic for $300-400.</p>

<p>So&#8230; for somewhere between $1000 and $2000 you can get a perfectly capable Leica rangefinder in good working order and a lens that is probably better than any you own right now. Both items will probably be able to be sold for exactly what you got them for, or more. Drop the price by $100 each and you can get rid of them in 24hrs. The combo will work exactly like an M9 (with the exception of metering), will take fantastic photos on film, and allow you to test out the wonderful world of rangefinders for pretty much free, assuming you sell the stuff if it is not for you. If you decide it is for you Â you can get some practice in while you save up the rest of the money, sell the body and keep using the 50 summicron on the M9, whatever.</p>

<p>You may notice that I did not recommend getting a Voigtlander body or lens just to test the waters. There are a bunch of reasons for this but I will focus on just one. The economic one, If you are not going to keep the Voigtlander and use it do not buy one, at least not new, and even used you will not be able to turn it around quickly or for even close to what you paid if you decide that the whole deal is not for you. The other reason is that although very similar, they are operationally not the virtual clone of other M series bodies and the M9.</p>

<p>One caveat - the older M bodies do not have a meter, none. This means you will have to meter with an external meter or your camera and transfer the settings. Don&#8217;t worry - if you light and your subject don&#8217;t change - your exposure doesn&#8217;t need to change - really. Take your reading - set the camera, shoot away. The M6 has a fantastic meter build in but you will have to know how to use it. It is not an evaluative meter and it is fairly tight so you have to know what you are pointing it at and what that means.</p>

<p>If you have any questions let me know - I have been a rangefinder shooter/lover for a long time and this is exactly what I would do if I didn&#8217;t already have a couple of M bodies laying around.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Sophia_Loren.jpg"><img title="Sophia_Loren.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.Sophia_Loren.jpg" border="0" alt="Sophia_Loren.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" align="left" /></a>Okay - so what is a post like this doing on a photography site. Answer = nothing, except it is an amusing conversation that I had with a few participants and a couple of models during an after hours review of work during one of the workshops I hosted. Of course there was absolutely no agreement or consensus for this particular list as a whole. How could there be, so much is based on individual taste, recollections, the minds eye of assembled images, voices, and portrayal, etc, etc. This was my list, heavily flavored by women I was exposed to during my formative years, or at least my impressions of them. Maybe the word glamourous is not even the right word - but I guess it is the only one word that means way more than &#8220;pretty&#8221; and wraps up a whole lot more. I think the french have a specific expression that does not translate well - I forget what it is.</p>

<p>On with the show, in no particular order. By the way I am a Veronica guy - vs. a Betty guy.</p>

<p>Jule Numar - my favorite catwoman.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/JulieNewmar_1.jpg.jpeg"><img title="JulieNewmar_1.jpg.jpeg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.JulieNewmar_1.jpg.jpeg" border="0" alt="JulieNewmar_1.jpg.jpeg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="120" height="150" /></a></p>

<p>Raquel Welch - a 60&#8217;s icon and amazing.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/b_RAQUEL_WELCH.jpg"><img title="b_RAQUEL_WELCH.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.b_RAQUEL_WELCH.jpg" border="0" alt="b_RAQUEL_WELCH.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="124" height="150" /></a></p>

<p>Angelina Jolie - yep, on my all time list, has been since Gia.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/angelina_jolie_1.jpg"><img title="angelina_jolie_1.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.angelina_jolie_1.jpg" border="0" alt="angelina_jolie_1.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="121" height="150" /></a></p>

<p>Brigitte Bardot - my oh, oh my.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/2009_08_20_RZ_PERSONALSTYLEBrigitteBardot.jpg"><img title="2009_08_20_RZ_PERSONALSTYLEBrigitteBardot.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.2009_08_20_RZ_PERSONALSTYLEBrigitteBardot.jpg" border="0" alt="2009_08_20_RZ_PERSONALSTYLEBrigitteBardot.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="106" height="150" /></a></p>

<p>Audrey Hepburn - later vs. earlier, Yes this is a drawing but it captures the younger and the more mature Audrey.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/audrey_hepburn_by_sarah123.jpg"><img title="audrey_hepburn_by_sarah123.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.audrey_hepburn_by_sarah123.jpg" border="0" alt="audrey_hepburn_by_sarah123.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="110" height="150" /></a></p>

<p>Sophia Loren- Anybody that can&#8217;t agree on this one is blind or an idiot, or maybe lying as in &#8220;Honey, do you thing Sophia is sexy?&#8221; - &#8220;Whooo, oh no, not nearly as sexy as you my dear&#8221;</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Sophia_Loren.jpg"><img title="Sophia_Loren.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.Sophia_Loren.jpg" border="0" alt="Sophia_Loren.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>

<p>Elizabeth Taylor - This may be a little controversial for the younger crowd - still images do this woman no justice - you have to see a movie with the whole package going. Yes Liz was one serious hotty.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/liz_taylor_011.jpg"><img title="liz_taylor_011.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.liz_taylor_011.jpg" border="0" alt="liz_taylor_011.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="129" height="150" /></a></p>

<p>Catherine Zeta-Jones - Hey I told you I am a sucker for the Veronica Type.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Catherine_Zeta_Jones_010.jpg"><img title="Catherine_Zeta_Jones_010.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.Catherine_Zeta_Jones_010.jpg" border="0" alt="Catherine_Zeta_Jones_010.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="109" height="150" /></a></p>

<p>Liv Tyler - Hey it&#8217;s my list here and this is my from left field pick.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/liv.jpg"><img title="liv.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.liv.jpg" border="0" alt="liv.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="149" height="150" /></a></p>

<p>Bette Paige - Yep - any arguments here? This is my substitute for what you may have expected - If I had to choose - Bette or Marilyn, it would be BP.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/BettyPaige.jpg"><img title="BettyPaige.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.BettyPaige.jpg" border="0" alt="BettyPaige.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="113" height="150" /></a></p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. Feel free to include your top ten list - and rationale, always fun to see the overlap and the arguments.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/2000_054_08.jpg"><img title="2000_054_08.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.2000_054_08.jpg" border="0" alt="2000_054_08.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="102" height="150" align="left" /></a>Have had a lot of interest and some interesting conversations fueled by my enthusiastic post greeting the recently released Leica M9. It appears that I am not the only one interested in the new M9. That&#8217;s not surprising - what is surprising is that there seems to be way more people interested in the M9 that have never shot with a film version - like the M6, than I ever predicted. A lot of the conversations that I have had with folks that would be delving into rangefinders for the first time are about lenses - given how idiotically expensive Leica glass is.</p>

<p>After giving it some thought over the weekend, I have come up with what I would do about lenses. Not necessarily what I have done but what I would do now - assuming that I did not have unlimited funds and knowing what I know now either by experience or the experience of others that I trust personally. Here are a couple of very broad things real quick and then some specifics. First I would NOT buy the new Leica budget lenses. It&#8217;s not because they are no good, it&#8217;s because I could do better for the same or less cost. I would also not buy the newest of the idiotically expensive Leica designs, like the 21 f1.4, Â unless I had a really really good reason. <a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/2001_042_10.jpg"><img title="2001_042_10.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.2001_042_10.jpg" border="0" alt="2001_042_10.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="102" align="right" /></a>If you must have a brand new Leica lens to go with your brand new Leica M9 - just so you have perfection to compare other things to, I would stick with something like the 35 or 50 f2 summicrons. Not cheap but as close to perfection as it gets.</p>

<p>Here is what I would do. I would probably buy Leica&#8217;s &#8220;normal-ish&#8221; kinds of lenses used of the 90&#8217;s or early 2000&#8217;s vintage. These lenses are perfect, are built to last a life time, and most of them have not been used all that much. They are not collectable and are half what new ones cost that have no fingerprints. On that point unless you are a collector Â stay away from collector stuff.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/2000_053_23.jpg"><img title="2000_053_23.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.2000_053_23.jpg" border="0" alt="2000_053_23.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="102" height="150" align="left" /></a>Moving on to the more exotic kinds of glass. I would buy the Voigtlander lenses. Specifically the <a href="http://www.cameraquest.com/voigt_5011.htm">50 f1.1</a> and the really really wide stuff. If you are on a much tighter budget I would not hesitate to use any of that line of lenses. The build quality is extremely good, probably better than the new &#8220;budget&#8221; Leica glass. For lenses that are not quite so exotic I would probably go with the Zeiss ZM series. Â The Zeiss ZM series are built by the same people as the Voigtlander lenses - just Carl Zeiss designs, tolerances, materials, etc. The 18, 21 f4.5 and <a href="http://www.adorama.com/ZI2128BBN.html">21 f2.8</a> are all very affordable and you will never see a difference between these and the Leica lenses. Heck the Voigtlander and Zeiss lenses are very good throughout the range if you want to go all out brand new. While you are at it grab the anniversary R2/R3 Voigtlander set WITH a 50mm f2 that is rated as good as anything else on the planet for about $1000 and you will have a film body to boot for half of what a 50mm f2 Summicron cost new.</p>

<p>Just my 2Â¢</p>

<p>Ps. The photos included with this post were all taken with an M6 and 50mm f2 Summicron. I would say about 80% of the reasonably decent photos of my three daughters where made with this combo or the 90 f2.8 Elmarit both extremely affordable and extremely capable.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/DSC_0282_v2.jpg"><img title="DSC_0282_v2.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.DSC_0282_v2.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_0282_v2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="101" align="left" /></a>I have had a lot of interest in the mini-review that I posted on Nik Silver EFEX Pro 3.0 that I posted a while back. The vast majority of readers have asked if I have ever used it to produce work for public consumption vs. crappy test images posted in the review. More so readers wanted some practical advise on getting decent prints on paper.</p>

<p>To answer part one - yes I have used it to produce non-crappy, well at least in my opinion, prints. Earlier this summer I produced two gigantic prints using Silver EFEX Pro printed on Museo Silver Rag. The prints are fantastic and look about as good as black and white gets using any medium. I plan on donating them to the community fund raiser - people love local photography, but that is a topic for another day. The images used for the prints are the one at the top of the post and this one:</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/DSC_0315.jpg"><img title="DSC_0315.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.DSC_0315.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_0315.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="101" align="left" /></a>Both images are small versions of the actual settings used for the prints and therefore are not really optimized for display. They have a lot of things in common and that brings us to part two of the question - getting decent prints on paper.</p>

<p>The most gigantic hurdle for a lot of photographers that &#8220;grew up&#8221; digital is getting decent prints. The sequence goes something like this - that looks good, print, &#8220;hey WTF this looks like crap on paper, how come it is so different&#8221;, then they go nuts on color management (usually not a huge issue in this day and age and usually not the root of the issue), still looks like crap, boost contrast, boost saturation, boost everything - hey it&#8217;s &#8220;better&#8221; but still sucks, just in a different way - all the detail is gone - no subtle tones, etc, etc.</p>

<p>Here is the facts - looking at images on the screen is like looking at slides on a light box - you have like 1000:1 contrast ratio between blacks and whites. On paper you are lucky to get like 100:1 in fantastic light with a perfect print. This is the root of the issue and something good black and white print folks have understood since the beginning of time. How to translate the real world that has a contrast ratio of like 1,000,000:1 onto paper with a contrast ratio orders of magnitude lower. The answer is not to lower the contrast of the scene and just put that onto paper as is - it will look hmmmm - FLAT. Lowering the contrast of the scene gets the image on film or sensor without blown out highlights or blocked up shadows but that is just the beginning. The answer is not boost the overall contrast so Â that the print has no detail in the shadows and highlights. The answer is local contrast.</p>

<p>On to some practical advise - remember my <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2009/09/10/weekly-aperture-complaint/">rant about the lame dodge/burn tool</a>? Again this is fundamental for good prints. Good prints have boat loads of local contrast in zones 3 to 7 or in digital speak about a quarter way into the histogram to about three quarters the way into the histogram. Maybe a little more either way. with tiny bits and pieces of stuff sprinkled in all over the place representing the bottom quarter and top quarter of the histogram. Histograms are all well and good but they tell you nothing about WHERE the tonal values are in relation to each other. I can show you two different images with the same exact histogram where one looks flat and the other looks fantastic. Just because your histogram looks &#8220;right&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean your print will look right or be good.</p>

<p>In the mini-review of Silver EFEX I raved about the little zone tool at the bottom left of all the tools. Here is why - after making decent prints for 20 years I still use this thing (or things like it) to make sure my eyes are not tricking me because I am looking at the image on the screen at 1000:1 contrast ratio. The two images posted have a couple things in common from an analytical perspective. The big thing is that they both have 80%+ of the tones between zone 3 and zone 7 on the little tool. Â The next thing is they both have way way less than 1% in zone 1 - this is as black as you can get - DMAX in old chemical speak. Oh and they both have absolutely NO zone 10 or paper white, not one pixel. This may or may not be appropriate for your image. For these it is. The other zones (mostly 8 and 2) are sprinkled about the very lightest and darkest areas in tiny little amounts adding to the local contrast. There are no large areas that are zone 8 or 9. The bright areas have the illusion of being fantastically bright because they are next to areas that are like zone 4 and 5. Trust me the magic all happens in zone 6 and 7.</p>

<p>If I pushed the highlight values one more zone the clouds would look like they were made out of concrete instead of water vapor. It&#8217;s not the absolute value it&#8217;s the tonal value that happens to be next to each other that give the impression of contrast and bright/darkness.</p>

<p>Hope this helps at all.</p>
