  <div class="entry-content"><p>All sorts of excited activity over on a Dutch website regarding a couple of different book sellers in the EU allegedly offering a book for sale with Aperture 3 as the title. I know that this is the same kind of thing that happened with the Amazon book Aperture X a few months ago but get this - multiple sites have the same book by the same author all stating the availability date is mid February.</p>

<p>Could this be true - is our wait over. Will it have all the 64bit GPU grandcentral accelerated goodness with Viveza baked in? Maybe a vastly improved default RAW decode for us NEF users. A revamp of the book tool? All that and a few things that we never even thought of?</p>

<p>We can only hope but what is that show that the boss lady is always making some sort of fun of the Dutch? &#8220;Better Off Ted&#8221;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/2010_001_10.jpg"><img title="2010_001_10.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/.thumbs/.2010_001_10.jpg" border="0" alt="2010_001_10.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="120" align="left" /></a>I have been doing this &#8220;sample print&#8221; thing for about two weeks now and it is not driving me nuts yet. It seems to be just about right in terms of my regular darkroom schedule. That is not the real topic of this post but sort of tangential. I have had a couple of inquires along the lines of &#8220;do you sell prints of your images&#8221;. The query has come up when I post a random image that someone happens to like and wants to buy &#8220;art&#8221;. It has also come up from readers that want to know what format, what prices, etc, etc. that I use to price &#8220;art work&#8221;. Last but certainly not least it has come up in reference to my $9 sample prints.</p>

<p>The first thing I want to do is explain a statement that I make on my sample print page regarding the fact that the prints are &#8220;work&#8221; grade prints and not final &#8220;art&#8221;. This does not mean they are flawed or somehow extra prints that I normally throw in the trash. It means that they are strait prints where I spend no time on &#8220;special effects&#8221;, local adjustments, split contrasts, bleaching, toning, dry mounting, matting, etc. It also means that even though I use my normal archival fixing and washing process that I do not test the individual prints for residuals.</p>

<p>Now that that is out of the way I want to tell you a little bit about my philosophy on selling &#8220;art&#8221; prints. I do sell prints but my feelings about doing it on-line are very mixed so for now I do not and probably won&#8217;t for a while if ever. I have toyed with the idea but there is something that irks me about selling a print to someone sight unseen with a completely unacceptable representation of it on-screen. It also bothers me that there is no context associated with the print. What I mean by this is that the image is isolated by itself and not really supported with any context of when, why, or what other images were made in relation to it.</p>

<p>These factors make me uncomfortable with charging what I absolutely must charge for the materials and labor required to make a final &#8220;art&#8221; print to someone online. Of course I could deal with a policy for that but there is no way I am going to put a policy out there that has me producing finished &#8220;art&#8221; work where I have to eat all the costs involved if a customer is not satisfied. There is also no way I am going to charge someone several hundred dollars for a print that they are not absolutely satisfied with.</p>

<p>Here is how I sell &#8220;art&#8221; prints - I sell them in person with a context. If an opportunity comes up that I am interested in and seems to fit projects that are either complete or have made progress I will show a few prints from that one project and sell them if anyone would like one. As of today I do not sell inkjet prints - not that you shouldn&#8217;t and I probably would if I contemplated that type of project in color. Maybe I will someday. Right now I sell 11x14 to 20x30 black and white silver prints. Handmade by me. That&#8217;s it. Usually ones from a recent project that I am still interested in.</p>

<p>For instance - the image at the top of the post. This is from a project that I have been working on for a while. I plan on showing a print of it with several others from this project in late february at a small local gathering wine and cheese - artsy fartsy type thing. I will price them realistically and if someone wants one I will sell it - as is. Meaning as displayed.</p>

<p>I am thinking about other ways to deliver some of my images in the context of projects that still interest me and are recent but right now I do not have them on-line and have not worked out a suitable on-line venue for my tastes and motivations. If and when I do I may make some prints available but they will NOT be hundreds and hundreds of dollars. I believe that that is a transaction that is best done up close and in person.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. The connection between this image and the &#8220;sample prints&#8221; is that I have used this for a couple of special requests on sample prints - namely people that want to see what TMAX 100 in MF looks like, etc. So&#8230; I am going to make this image available as an option for a sample print. No I am not a landscape guy but this project is a long story - maybe I will share a bit of that story in a post about personal projects.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/ApertureScreen1.jpg"><img title="ApertureScreen1.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/.thumbs/.ApertureScreen1.jpg" border="0" alt="ApertureScreen1.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="92" align="left" /></a>I have seen this issue and question on how to resolve it so much lately that I thought I would share a tidbit from my Aperture File Management eBook. If you have been using Aperture heavily for a while you have probably run into the problem where Aperture associates the wrong thumbnail image to a master image. I don&#8217;t know the exact conditions that cause this to happen but I can tell you it is definitely some sort of concurrency bug in Aperture. Based on my non-clinical research and my own experience this issue rears it&#8217;s ugly head when you are trying to do a whole lot at the same time within Aperture. Like running an import and moving files into/out of a project into another one, generating previews, etc.</p>

<p>When this problem happens logical courses of action rarely resolve it like &#8220;rebuild thumbnails&#8221;. Sure try that first but most likely you already did or you wouldn&#8217;t be searching the internet for an answer. I have personally done just about every bizarre gyration including diving into the Aperture library structure and database internals to figure out how to MAKE aperture fix this or at least find a way to fix it myself instead of starting from scratch.</p>

<p>By a wide margin the easiest way to make Aperture fix this problem while not getting rid of your images/edits/metadata/etc by starting over on the effected images is to create a new empty project. Copy the images in the project with the problem to the new empty project by selecting them and then option dragging them to the new one. Now just to be save do not do anything while the images are being copied. When it is all done check out your &#8220;new&#8221; project and if everything looks honky-dory then delete the old project hook, line, and sinker.</p>

<p>The reason this works is that the problem stems from sqlite database structures that are inside the project being corrupted in such a way that nothing you can do from within Aperture including &#8220;database repair&#8221; fixes them. Actually the database structures are fine - the data in them is wrong.  When you copy the images to a new project all of the data structures are rebuilt one by one from scratch in the new project.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. Hope this helps some poor lost souls out there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/2000_064_07.jpg"><img title="2000_064_07.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/.thumbs/.2000_064_07.jpg" border="0" alt="2000_064_07.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="left" /></a>No I am not obsessing on Seiff again but I had to post a quick apology to those of you that are still reading the post and looking for the book that I recommended. If you have not followed my articles for a while you may get the impression that I am some sort of elitist that only recommends very very expensive &#8220;stuff&#8221;. My general MO is good value as in my suggestions for low cost solutions to photographic endeavors. Hey take a look at my eBook prices and my price for a sample print.</p>

<p>Here is the story. When I posted the <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2010/01/03/jeanloup-sieff-follow-up-2/">follow up article to Sieff recommending a book</a> I went to my own library and picked my favorite Sieff book. I bought this think in the early 1990&#8217;s for like 30 or 40 bucks - it&#8217;s right on the back dust jacket. I bought it from Borders. As a convenience I posted a search link to Amazon for that book. After I put up the article with the link I visited it myself to make sure that it worked. Sticker shock - the book was not available from Amazon itself but was available new from 3 different venders. Each of those vendors wanted like $149.00 for the new ones. There were also a few dozen used copies available that were priced from $90.00 to $149.00.</p>

<p>I was shocked that it was so expensive but I thought in 2010 $90 would still be fine for a book of this quality. Well it is now almost two weeks later and I was alerted by a reader that I am nuts. Why does he think I am nuts? Because since I posted the article there is only one vendor selling new copies and they are now priced at $350.00. There are also only 13 used copies available.</p>

<p>I have no idea if I caused a run on the books or it is a total coincidence. I did feel compelled to tell all of you that I am not in the habit of recommending $350 books. In fact I don&#8217;t think I own a book that cost me even half that.</p>

<p>Sorry.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Ektalure.jpg"><img title="Ektalure.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/.thumbs/.Ektalure.jpg" border="0" alt="Ektalure.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="120" height="150" align="left" /></a>Not all things go as planned with shooting film and printing on &#8220;real&#8221; silver paper. That&#8217;s okay though because sometimes they lead somewhere else. I wish I was the kind of person that was a &#8220;lemonade from lemons&#8221; kind of attitude - I am probably too much of a control freak for that but when it does happen I like to share it.</p>

<p>I recently acquired a HUGE box of Kodak Ektalure black and white paper - I had big plans for this if it were &#8220;good&#8221;. Kodak stopped making this stuff a long long time ago and although I did not use it as a standard - there were some images that were made for this paper. It had a unique surface texture - not to much but unique. It had a unique base color and it had a very unique and malleable emulsion color that you could tweak to very different hues with development, toning, etc.</p>

<p>Long story short - I have a small stock pile of good Ektalure but not really enough to do a serious large project. I was hoping this &#8220;new&#8221; box would give me some breathing room. As you can tell from the attached image it is badly fogged and not too useful for general purposes but&#8230;</p>

<p>I kind of liked the image that this produced with my a test image that I use to evaluate a lot of graded and multi-contrast papers for a lot of reasons that I will not go into here. It got me thinking that I may want to try to &#8220;Lith&#8221; this paper. No amount of restrainer or anti-fog agent will let this paper work well with normal exposure - the fog is too dense but&#8230;. I can see clearly based on knowing my test negative that the fog will not even be in the realm of usable exposure for a Lith print so my next order from Freestyle has a couple of different Lith type developers to see what I can do with this paper.</p>

<p>I will let you know how it turns out.</p>

They may not be important to anyone else. They may not even be &#8220;good&#8221; but they will be the most important. The reason that I continue to beat everyone that will listen over the head with this is because of my own experience and the number of photographers that I have interacted with over the years that do not shoot people that are close to them. Okay - so you are a landscape photographer, or a sports photographer, or a fashion photographer. That might be an important part of earning a livelihood or an important part of your artistic expression but the images are not nearly as important as those of people that are close to you.</p>

<p>I just posted two random images of daughter number one and two in this post as an example along with two images I plucked at random from one of my daughter&#8217;s facebook pages. I hope that you can see what I mean. The one at the top is daughter number two. Here is daughter number one.<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/2000_027_29.jpg"><img title="2000_027_29.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/.thumbs/.2000_027_29.jpg" border="0" alt="2000_027_29.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="right" /></a></p>

<p>The old pictures are from the beginning of the 00&#8217;s the new ones are at the end of the 00&#8217;s. If this does not make my point not much will. If you can&#8217;t tell who&#8217;s who in my images it doesn&#8217;t matter. I will give you a hint - the blurry one is both of them. The others are with their friends they are usually the skinniest people in the photo but in the color one - white dress and black and white one - the white hat.</p>

You have probably seen at least one photograph by Horst in your lifetime, even if you had no idea who made it. You probably even remember it if you run across it again now that you know who it is. I looked at Horst the first time in my teens and have returned to his work over and over again. As with all of the photographers that I introduce in this series I never seem to get tired of the work.</p>

<p>As a side note - I did not notice how heavily influenced a lot of my composition, lighting and overall style was influenced by Horst until I was in my mid-thrities. As I look back now (and as I discovered then) it is glaringly obvious that I was quite influenced by my exposure to <a href="http://www.horstphorst.com/">Horst. Take a look</a> - I do not think it will be a waste of time no matter what your genre or medium is.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/2000-067-10_1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2109" title="2000-067-10_1" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/2000-067-10_1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>I just wanted to give a quick Thank You to all of you that have given support and feedback about the first couple of Aperture eBooks. I am glad that all of you that have written me have found them worthwhile and more than you expected. I also appreciate all of the ideas and suggestions given regarding future eBooks on Aperture.</p>

<p>Right now I have been working on the next one for the last month and it is pretty slow going. It is dedicated to the Aperture book tool. I am finding this one pretty difficult. I have totally rewritten it once so far. It&#8217;s pretty difficult to hone in on making the book tool info succinct while being somewhat comprehensive. I hope to get this thing ready to go on air in the next month.</p>

<p>Now for  a tiny little bit of self promotion - I was overwhelmed by the amount of positive feedback I have received so far. Here are just a couple of snippets that did not embarrass me too much.</p>

<blockquote><em>&#8230;wanted to let you know that I thought is was great - I learned quiet a few things. Your discussion of stacks and stack picks and album picks was a revelation for me. One thing that I do for family events is print 6x4 prints and I must do a special cropping to this aspect ratio. I have forced Aperture to do this with great effort and pain. Your example of how you do 8x10 cropping was an &#8220;ah-ha&#8221; moment for me. I found many other useful bits of info as well. I have read a book on Aperture usage and did the lynda.com online training, but your presentation of the material was best. After I hit send on this email, I am going to buy your other ebook based on my great experience with this one. &#8230;</em></blockquote>


<p>Tom USA</p>

<blockquote><em>&#8230;I am incredibly impressed with the way you lay out and
communicate Aperture and its many uses.  &#8230; Thank
you for sharing all of your knowledge about Aperture!</em></blockquote>


<p>Brad USA</p>

<blockquote>&#8230;<em>Thank you for the wonderful ebooks! I downloaded both of them and really enjoyed reading them. Manuals are great but bori</em><em>ng to read which is why books like yours are needed to make learning experience fun&#8230;</em></blockquote>


<p>Leo</p>

<blockquote>&#8230;<em>thought I would drop you a quick note to express my appreciation of your knowledge and advice.  I still have a great deal to go through on RB Design but have already whipped my Previews into shape and, through the use of blue folders, have my projects nicely organised, finally!</em></blockquote>


<p>Anonymous</p>

<blockquote><em>Derek Story&#8217;s excellent DVD from </em><em>Lynda.com</em><em> gave me a solid foundation in Aperture but I have since been looking for a source to help with the detail.  &#8230; I also just bought the Apple Pro Training book but probably should have saved myself the money - having had a quick look at this,  for example, there is nothing like the detail in your Managing Previews&#8230;</em></blockquote>


<p>Nicholas Hong Kong</p>

<p>Okay okay enough already - Thank you all. Now I have to get back to the darkroom where I am continually humbled by simple particles of silver that are not so generous with the feedback and are much more intolerant and demanding task masters than all of you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/AdoxMCC110_1.jpg"><img title="AdoxMCC110_1.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/.thumbs/.AdoxMCC110_1.jpg" border="0" alt="AdoxMCC110_1.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="181" align="left" /></a>Wrapped up my first batch of sample prints last night and they are now being &#8220;flattened&#8221;. They will ship Monday before noon. I got a few questions on &#8220;what they look like&#8221;. Well it&#8217;s kind of hard to put into words but I will try briefly. They look a whole lot like my contact sheets but bigger and on typical air dried fiber black and white paper. They may curl a bit due to the changing environment and not being final mounted art work. They are meant to be educational and provide a reasonable evaluation of the actual material.</p>

<p>As is par for the course I will occasionally screw up a print - badly. Or run a quick test to fully evaluate how a negative responds to a paper. When I do this I will sometimes include the damaged print with a slightly different treatment than the undamaged print. I do this because the damaged prints and initial tests will end up in the trash anyway but may be useful for someone trying to evaluate the paper or even someone just getting into black and white printing. These are actual scans of two actual trial prints<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/AdoxMCC110_2.jpg"><img title="AdoxMCC110_2.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/.thumbs/.AdoxMCC110_2.jpg" border="0" alt="AdoxMCC110_2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="181" align="right" /></a> I did to evaluate Adox MCC 110&#8217;s response to this negative in the highlights/mids/shadows. I actually ended up with something in the middle-ish as the actual work print. What did I do with these? They are going out to some unlucky winner of the random lottery along with the work-gradeprint sample. Yep all three. Why not - they are very useful in evaluating what the paper does.</p>

<p>One last thing - here is the &#8220;brief writeup&#8221; [download#12] that I was talking about that also comes with each test print. This one corresponds to this negative/print match-up on Adox MCC 110</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/black-and-white-sample-prints/">You can get one here</a> - I have processed a number of special requests so far and will probably add variations the prove to be more than one-offs so do not hesitate to ask.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/1999_026_10.jpg"><img title="1999_026_10.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/.thumbs/.1999_026_10.jpg" border="0" alt="1999_026_10.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="left" /></a>I have talked about metering and exposure on and off along with the infamous &#8220;histogram&#8221; and how useless it is if you don&#8217;t know what the scene looks like - or &#8220;should&#8221; look like. Today I am going to put some random thoughts out there for people that are addicted to &#8220;matrix metering&#8221; and auto exposure. I am also going to start off with a statement that is a bit controversial.</p>

<p>Speaking in absolute terms here is a point that I am absolutely sure about - If you have or take time to view an image on the back of your camera - and maybe look at the &#8220;histogram&#8221; you should absolutely positively NOT be using matrix metering or auto exposure. It&#8217;s stupid, counter productive, and make absolutely no sense whatsoever. Let me add to that a corollary or so. If you shoot the same subject in the same light - same thing.</p>

<p>The only thing that matrix or evaluative or whatever your camera maker calls it is good for is if you have one shot to get the image and the light/scene is changing very rapidly. That&#8217;s it - now that might be important but usually it&#8217;s not.  In fact if you look at your image/histogram and then add/subtract &#8220;exposure compensation&#8221; while still in the same metering mode and auto exposure this is completely idiotic. Why the hell would you want to be arguing with the freaking camera? So that you can see the camera&#8217;s counter argument when your framing changes slightly or your subject turns into or away from the light a wee bit?</p>

<p>I hear a lot of people talk about &#8220;getting to know&#8221; how your camera&#8217;s meter works and reacts - they talk about this in conjunction with evaluative metering. I guess that&#8217;s all fine and dandy if you like to play guessing games and see how close you were and maybe even try to out guess what your camera is going to do by screwing with exposure compensation before even taking the picture. This is the stupidest - most jacked-off idea and advice I have ever heard. Why the hell would you bother? What is the point? Personally I think people that actually have this working method are retarded - I think people that give this advice don&#8217;t actually use it, they like other people to think that somehow they are smarter because trying to do this is such a waste of time and completely unproductive.</p>

<p>The last thing that I want is to have exposure variations all over the map when shooting the same subject and same light. This is a royal pain in the ass - same goes for auto white balance. I guess it&#8217;s fine if you take one frame of each subject and move on to the next. Here is they way normal people do it - if you do it this way you will not only get consistent results you will get better. Not just with your camera but all cameras and all mediums. In fact the next time you get a new camera or use a different film or switch from slide film to negative film it will take you all of 5 minutes to get EXACTLY the results you want every time.</p>

<p>Use a spot meter - use the one built in to your camera - they all got&#8217;em. Point it at what you care about. Set the camera to manual and do what it says. This may be wrong when you look at the back of your camera. Don&#8217;t use exposure comp. just dial the aperture or shutter to give more or less exposure. After about 10 shots of 10 different kinds of tones/things you will know exactly how to set your camera for the rest of your life - first try. As an added bonus your photographic vision will get better in terms of how YOU want what tones rendered relative to each other in any given scene. DONE. Want to know how far you can go either way with rendering various tones on your choosen medium/sensor - just try it. It won&#8217;t change - ever.</p>

<p>Of course there are other working methods that work just as easily and are just as fool proof maybe I will go over them in more detail sooner or later but they work using the same mentality. Don&#8217;t do it because it is harder or more professional, do it because it is easier. Really.</p>

<p>Rant Over.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. Can you tell I just ran across the 9,000 shit head giving the &#8220;get to know&#8221; your evaluative metering system advise. 9,000 is my tolerance limit for stupid, jacked-off useless things that people either theorize about or parrot from jacked-off sources that were either stupid or sarcastic when it was first uttered.</p>
