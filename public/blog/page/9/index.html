  <div class="entry-content"><p>I get a bunch of emails that go something like &#8220;Hey RB, why no posts on image manipulation using Aperture?&#8221;. Well&#8230; A couple of reasons come to mind. The first of which is that I don&#8217;t do a lot of manipulation and adjustment on my personal images. More than half the time I use the OoC JPEG. This has more to do with what I like than anything else. Believe me, I have had more cumulative hours of wrenching and hammering images into completely different beings than what they started out as than I care to remember. Consider it aversion therapy via commercial fashion.</p>

<p>At this point I believe that I could probably take about half dozen so-so lit images and hammer those six images into everything from a Hawaiian Sunset to a fashion spread and anything in between. So I guess it doesn&#8217;t really float my boat much. Having said that I am not at all opposed to optimizing images from RAW material - Heck I do it all the time for other photographers that rather spend their time doing what they are good at - shooting fantastic raw material.</p>

<p>The second reason I don&#8217;t chit-chat about it much is that Aperture 3 adjustments are so intuitive from my perspective there is not much to talk about. I forget that a lot of folks haven&#8217;t been screwing around in post for over a decade. On that note I will succumb to popular demand and post some more image adjustment material from an Aperture 3 perspective under the SuperSimpleStuff™ banner. For the most part it will be global adjustments rather than localized for the simple reason that Apple shouldn&#8217;t have even bothered with the bag-on-the-side, crude, cumbersome, local adjustment brush implementation that jammed into Aperture 3. Bottom line - I don&#8217;t use them. I use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003B32B2I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=B003B32B2I">Photoshop CS4 and CS5</a> along with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZHQ2OO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=B002ZHQ2OO">Nik Vivez 2</a> for all local adjustments again, mostly for others that I do print work for.</p>

<p>On with the SuperSimpleStuff™ show. For this installment I am going to start off with one of my patented StupidCrap™ images shot about 42 seconds after waking up on full auto with a Nikon D200. I am not a morning person nor am I an outdoorsy person but every once in a while I will point the camera outside from my current vantage point and snap a few. In this case while having my wake-up cigarette prior to my wake-up coffee I shot this horrible waste of space. Luckily I always shoot RAW+JPEG.</p>

</a></p>

<p>You are probably thinking &#8220;WTF&#8221; - well, if you look real hard there are some God-rays in the early morning clouds and some relatively attractive mist in the background. Everybody shoots God-rays and rainbows don&#8217;t they?? In fact I am continually intrigued by my little bird buddy on the wire that you see in the foreground. It seems that whenever I notice some interesting scene out on the bay - be it clouds, weather, rain, god-rays, etc. That little bird is there apparently observing the same scene as I am. Honestly I have no idea if it&#8217;s the same bird or not but it sure does seem like it is. I have dozens of images with him in the foreground observing rain-bows, etc.</p>

<p>I am a little wobbly when I first roll out of bed and we don&#8217;t really care about all the foreground detritus so let&#8217;s give it a bit of straiten and a large dose of crop like so&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/DSC_1054-sc.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/DSC_1054-sc.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>Since shooting on auto-everythig gives you crappy images that you didn&#8217;t intend in a lot of cases that is exactly what I got. In my imagination and how things looked to me at the time it was a bit darker and definitely more bluish. I would like to think I probably would have shot it bluer and put the dark clouds around middle gray if I were actually in manual mode and thinking clearly. No problem with RAW, I just cooled it off a bit and made it less green using the WB control block and reduced the exposure by a half stop or so. Here are my adjustments.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/WBexp.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/WBexp.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>And voila, a bit more of what was in my minds eye. Just a note here on the exposure and enhance blocks in Aperture 3. They are very very powerful and most of the time you can get to where you want to be using just those control sliders. I happen to know that I am going to use a curves adjustment on this to bring out the god-rays and get the overall contrast where I want it so I am not going to mess with any of the other stuff in the exposure or enhancement blocks. There are a lot of ways to skin a cat - or get to the same place in any image manipulation software. In many cases there is not right way, just the most convenient for a particular user or a particular image. In reality I could have done what I just did to the exposure with Aperture curves but it was more convienient just to use the exposure slider as I will already be using more than one curve point based on my non-clinical evaluation of where I want this to go.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/DSC_1054-WBexp.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/DSC_1054-WBexp.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>Moving on to the curves tool. The first thing I did was place a pint somewhere in the upper mid tones to highlights and moved it around until it was approximately at the point of the luminance of the god-rays. I did this to nail the god-rays and brighter values down to sort of keep them where they are. I then moved the left end arrow into the histogram to get black-blacks and simultaneously ramp up the contrast a bit. You can do the same type of thing with the black point slider which has much finer control and can actually go &#8220;negative&#8221; but has fixed ways in which it manipulates that bottom portion of the tones. If you want fine control of dark tones using curves you could set the &#8220;range&#8221; to shadows.Next I wanted even more contrast and darker lower-midtones so I placed another point in the shadows portion of the curve and drug it down a bit. The last thing I did was bring down that first point a bit as the upper mids and highlights were too bright and too flat. Here is what the curves looked like when I was done.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Curves.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Curves.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>and the image at this point.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/DSC_1054-Curves.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/DSC_1054-Curves.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>I still thought the highlights were a little over the top and wanted to avoid using Aperture 3&#8217;s clunky local adjustment brushes so I brought the entire thing to into where I wanted it with Aperture 3&#8217;s glorious Highligts and Shadows control block. In this case I brought down the highlights and adjusted &#8220;High Tonal Width&#8221; under the advanced section so that it only messed with the tones I wanted to bring down. I also added a bit of mid-tone contrast. Here is what the control looked like.</p>

<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/HS.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>and the image now&#8230;</p>

<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/DSC_1054-HS.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>The last thing I did was add a very very slight vignette to darken the edges and done it is a big one&#8230;.</p>

</a></p>

<p>I hope this provides some food for thought on using Aperture 3&#8217;s RAW adjustments creatively and where you want to take some of your images or even some of your StupidCrap™</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you do you probably know what the picture in this post is. If not you might have a hard time figuring it out without the suggestive title. It is a shot of the swarms of migrating birds that seem to be about a mile long and a half mile wide that are so thick with birds it is hard to even estimate how many there might be. Ten thousand? I don&#8217;t know. In any case this image doesn&#8217;t at all do justice to what it looks like. When you first see it during spring and fall seasons it is so surreal that you have to ask yourself if it&#8217;s real.</p>

</a></p>

<p>As you know I am not the &#8220;outdoorsy type&#8221;. A real nature photographer would have setup in the right spot and waited and waited and waited with all the right gear etc etc. You see that I could not even be bothered to walk across the street in order to get rid of the roof tops and overhead wires.</p>

<p>The reason I am posting this is not to display my lack of skill and interest in photographing nature stuff but more as a testament to how fantastic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XS2M7E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=B004XS2M7E">Photoshop CS5</a> photomerge is. I swear it&#8217;s better than most of the dedicated tools that I have played with and actually easier to use in my opinion. On a lark I used my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WJR69E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=B003WJR69E">panasonic LX5</a> (still love that little thing) on complete automatic/pattern metering/etc. The crazy part is that I shot 6 or 7 vertical comps hand held at 90mm with not much care or even plans to stitch them together. For the heck of it I just through 3 of them together for this illustration. If I add more it just makes the birds smaller.</p>

<p>If you do panoramas or anything like stitching you may want to check out CS5 just for the improved photo merge. I picked up the upgrade for the 64-bit-ness for my large scanned files. On another front - I finally upgraded to Silver EFEX pro 2 and will have some thoughts in the next week that I can post. There is some bad with the good, hence my procrastination of installing the 64-bit <em>new and  improved</em> version.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Blake is a fellow reader that has not really had a whole lot to do with film in his photographic endeavors. He has been looking into shooting some for a bit and we have exchanged a few emails about it and he finally took the plunge when he added a new member to his family. I asked him if he would share a few thoughts on the subject and he replied with what follows. Not too bad for only shooting this kit for a short time so far&#8230;</p>

<p>RB,</p>

<p>Thank you for letting me share my experiences regarding getting into film!  First, let me say that I am simply your average Joe who enjoys taking pictures.  Like most, I spend too much time jumping from site to site and blog to blog reading the latest and greatest about all things photography.  I am sure most of us are in that same boat - we know enough to make us dangerous, and take decent enough photos that all our friends say the same thing: &#8220;Wow, great shots!  What camera do you use?&#8221;  ;~)</p>

<p>Anyway, I decided a few months ago to look into getting a film camera.  Having just turned 30, I never had any real experience with the stuff other than the few high school photo classes I took years ago.  I made this decision after coming to the realization that I prefer the look of a &#8220;photograph&#8221; rather than a &#8220;digital picture&#8221;.  To me, shots with film seem to be softer and smoother than the so annoyingly crisp files digital cameras seem to produce.  (That it not to say soft/out of focus, but more organic/natural.)  The gradations in the B&amp;W film and accurate color in the color film is just amazing (with no post processing, to boot!).</p>

<p>My first choice for my film camera was a Nikon F100.  This only made sense as I&#8217;m a Nikon shooter and already have several lenses that can be used on the body.  Let me tell you, the mere sound that the shutter makes is reason enough to buy a film camera!  Plus, I picked mine up for $175 on Craigslist (and the body still sells new today for $750… go figure).  And don&#8217;t even get me started on the full frame viewfinder!  Makes me hate my D300 that much more.</p>

<p>When my wife and I welcomed our daughter into this world last month, naturally, I brought my new toy.  (On a side note, those days in the hospital were rough!)</p>

</a></p>

<p>While my F100 is a fantastic camera, I have always wanted a Hasselblad.  The allure of the name itself has always pulled at me.  So, after a good little hunt, I picked up a body, 2 lenses, and 3 backs on Craigslist for $500.  I mean, this stuff is basically free today!  After dropping about that much more in getting it cleaned, lubed, and adjusted I was all set to play with film some more.  But, man, learning to deal with a reversed viewfinder is rough!!  Additionally, the quality of the lens construction is simply out of this world.  Both of my lenses are 40 years old, but they feel so much more solid than my high dollar Nikon glass.  Just the focus rings themselves feel so sturdy and true, as opposed to the plastic-like feeling of the current generation of gear.</p>

<p>love how real the skin looks in all these photographs.  And guess what, I spent zero time on post processing.  Digital always needs something to make it look decent (usually a contrast/curves adjustment and white balancing, at a minimum).</p>

<p>In closing, working with film has taught me two important things about photography.  First, I have learned to slow down and think about every single shot I make.  Digital makes us lazy, in that we just blast away not caring about any particular frame.  Film costs money… it forces you to make sure you want to press that shutter button.  Secondly, I love getting my scans back from the lab and being done.  It&#8217;s so funny that so much software and post processing technique is solely focused on achieving that &#8220;film look&#8221;.  Hey, why not just shoot film?</p>

<p>If you need some real inspiration and a reason why to shoot film, check out some of the work from Jose Villa, Jonathan Canlas, or one of the best ever Steve McCurry (maybe the most famous NatGeo photog of all time).</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all!  Have fun trying something new - you may just like it.</p>

<p>Now… if I could only get my hands on a Leica M6 and 50mm… ;~)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Disclaimer: I love Aperture 3 in more ways than I can count so understand that the following is in the context of how nuts it drives me to see something as good as Aperture 3 sullied by this sort of stupid shit, time and time again.</p>

<p>On with the show. As you probably know by now, Aperture and I have been doing battle over silly white balance nonsense since day friggin one. Well at some point in the not too distant past it has broken in yet a new way as well has some strange variations on all of the old ways it has been broken. I swear the guy/gal in charge of WB RAW file stuff at Apple is brain dead - some sort of victim of a strange disease, or a lifetime glue sniffing habit. Who knows but he must be one of Steve&#8217;s relatives because he desperately needs to be let go but seems to still be on the job since day one. There is no way a different person could be screwing the pooch in such bizarre ways. In fact I can&#8217;t even imagine how to do some of this on friggin purpose.</p>

<p>First - the new Aperture WB silliness. This one looks like it can affect anyone&#8217;s workflow and relatively independent of camera make or model. You are going to have to follow closely here even with the provided screen shots.</p>

<p>First let&#8217;s click on a RAW image with the adjustment inspector showing after freshly starting Aperture&#8230; Cool every thing looks fine (sort of - more on this later.)</p>

</a></p>

<p>Next let us click on another image - this one shot specifically for this illustration with a DIFFERENT WB set by myself - on freaking purpose.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/sc2.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/sc2.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>WTF - look at the color temp in the WB adjustment brick. It&#8217;s the same exact number as the last image with a completely different WB. God-friggin-damit, another freaking WB issue, damit, damit, WTF. What the hell is going on here???? Cutting to the chase if you deselect all images so that NOTHING, as in no data, is showing in the adjustment inspector and then click on the last image you get the &#8220;right&#8221; numbers. Well at least you get different ones that seem to be correlated in the right direction but the numbers themselves make no sense whatsoever. This part is not new, it&#8217;s something I have yet to ever get anyone at Apple to explain but the kelvin numbers are pretty much chosen at random depending on the RAW file maker and camera model - this one has been driving me forking nuts for years. Nikon is not the only RAW files to act this way in Aperture - far from it.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/sc31.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/sc31.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>Now you may think this is no big deal but it is&#8230; THOSE COMPLETELY BOGUS NUMBERS that came from the first image you brought up actually stick and make the image WRONG if you activate the WB control. It seems to go back to the original (wrong) numbers for the image file in question if you hit the reset on the control but in any case this is just one more WB bit of bullshit that Apple can&#8217;t seem to get right - come on how freaking hard can this be?</p>

<p>Moving on to a strange variation of the whacky arbitrary numbers in the WB that Aperture interprets NO MATTER HOW YOU SET YOUR CAMERA - well at least on some cameras like Nikons, and now Panasonics, and more&#8230;. This one really sucks and I have only seen it affect the panasonic LX5 and GF1 RW2 files so far. Hold onto your hats now&#8230;. Those whacky numbers in the WB that Aperture interpreted (not the ones stuck from a previous image) are NOT the same as the actual WB that the RAW file is processed with. What does this mean? A picture is worth a thousand words&#8230;</p>

</a></p>

<p>Here is another&#8230;.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/sc5-wrong.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/sc5-wrong.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>What you are looking at is dramatically different WB using the SAME WB information that Aperture 3 is telling you came in with the camera. The only thing I did was activate the WB adjustment block as compared to the other image. You can hit the reset button all you want but it will not return it to the way that Aperture 3 displays the image sans adjustment block. WTF? As I said I have tested lots of NEF&#8217;s and even though the WB numbers are screwy and do not match what you set in camera they do not display differently when you leave them at the imported state and activate the WB adjustment block. So far this happens on the GF1 and LX5 - is this happening to any of your RAW files???</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A quick follow up on my original comments about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I0JKSS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002I0JKSS">Aperture 3</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WJR69E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003WJR69E">Panasonic LX5</a> RAW processing. Included are a few screen shots where you can examine the relative differences between these popular RAW processors. I know I have done my share of complaining about Aperture and NEF files over the years but when it comes to Panasonic RAW files Aperture 3 does a bang up job in my opinion. I have yet to have any reason whatsoever to revert to another RAW processor for either the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WJR69E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003WJR69E">LX5</a> for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MUAEX4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002MUAEX4">GF1</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a full frame comparison of all four. Going from left to right and top to bottom the images are from Silkypix,ACR5 (LR3/ACR), in camera produced JPEG, and finally the <a href="http://">Aperture 3 RAW conversion</a>. Note that these are as imported into Aperture with NO adjustments, the same applies to both Silkypix and ACR as well - strait defaults. The in camera produced JPEG was on the &#8220;standard&#8221; setting.</p>

</a></p>

<p>Next in the same order we have the obligatory 100%view&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/sc1-ico1.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/sc1-ico1.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>Finally we have the same view but with a minor color and sharpening adjustment quickly applied to more closely mimic the in camera produced JPEG. I could get a little closer but couldn&#8217;t help myself to back off the &#8220;range&#8221; adjustment a bit when shifting the greens in order to differentiate the yellows a bit more.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/sc2-ico.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/sc2-ico.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>All three RAW processors use far less aggressive sharpening than the in camera produced JPEG, all three seem to show a slight increase in tonal gradation or color differentiation between similar hues, and surprisingly all three have almost identical color treatments by default. As is obvious the greens are probably closer to reality and more yellow than the JPEG but who wants reality. All of the RAW processors are also almost identical in their treatment of lens distortion and other lens defects like CA which leads me to believe that the info to do those corrections is probably embedded in the RAW file versus a guess.</p>

<p>One other thing to note is that all of these RAW processors are slightly more saturated than the camera &#8220;standard&#8221; JPEG and out of all of them Aperture 3 seems to have the most saturation by default. It&#8217;s not over the top but definitely more saturated than the other two. To match the camera standard JPEG I reduced the overall saturation level quite a bit. The bottom line is that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I0JKSS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002I0JKSS">Aperture 3 does a great job on LX5 RAW</a> files and I have no complaints at all when compared to the other leading RAW processors for Panasonic files.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You have all probably figured this out by now but Aperture 3&#8217;s image zoom tools are pretty cool. As part of the SuperSimpleStuff™ series I wanted to note one minor behavior that you may not have noticed based on a one on one session that I did where this came up.</p>

<p>As you know there are about 9 different ways to zoom an image depending on if you have a track pad or not along with the built in keys and predefined zooms. One of the coolest ways is to drag the mouse over the &#8220;percent&#8221; label to the left or right on the full image preview thumbnail that pops up no matter what zoom mode you are using.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/zoom.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/zoom.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>The question that came up is how to &#8220;get out&#8221; of zoom mode and get rid of that little thumbnail with the percent label once you are in zoom mode. I guess those of us that have been using Aperture since day one found that it is intuitively the &#8220;Z&#8221; key to go back to &#8220;normal&#8221; where Aperture determines how to fit the image in the viewer on it&#8217;s own. For old time Aperture users it&#8217;s intuitive because that&#8217;s all there was - the Z key - to toggle 100% and normal. For those new to Aperture and happen to be using some other method of activating zoom mode on images, like the command + and - keys, I guess it may not be apparent.  Once you use an alternative method to zoom the image you can&#8217;t just back it off to go back to normal as one might expect.</p>

<p>The answer is no matter how you got into zoom mode - with a gesture, a menu choice, or the command keys - just hit the Z key to get out. Simple as that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here is one for the Aperture 3 SuperSimpleStuff™ series based on a question that I received about reprocessing RAW files. The question was how to efficiently select all all the RAW files that were previously unsupported&#8230;</p>

<p>First off make sure you are looking at your all photos view near the top of the project inspector and clear out any old search criteria. Then open up the search HUD and add criteria that looks something like this.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/findRAW.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/findRAW.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>You know what to do from here&#8230; Just select them all with command+A then choose reprocess master from the photo menu.</p>

<p>This is probably the easiest way to get at all the RAW files produced by a certain type of camera. The couple of caveats to this are that you want to make sure that &#8220;stack picks only&#8221; is unchecked so that you get all the RAW versions even if they happen not to be on the top of a stack. The other one is that  a RAW version must show up somewhere for this to work. What I mean is that if you imported RAW+JPEG pairs with the JPEG being used as the master you will either need to switch all of those version to use the RAW master by using a similar search or better yet duplicate the versions and then switch those new versions to use the RAW master.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I help people with their own photography. One of the things that I do is help to design and produce prints. This is great since I believe that prints are a much more gratifying end result to the photographic endeavor than say looking at them on your computer. Last week I took a trip to visit a firm that produces all types of display work for the Smithsonian. Myself and <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/">Les Picker</a> plan on using some of their unique capabilities for upcoming display installations.</p>

<p>One of the things we did was preview a few images that are going into an installation next week. These are four 24&#8221;x36&#8221; prints that came off of a Durst Lambda on a single sheet. This printer has amazing color as you can probably see even from this crappy shot.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1010264.jpg" rel="lightbox">

</a></p>

<p>These prints will ultimately ended up on face mounted plexiglass that I will shoot a couple of images for you to see the finished product. Not cheap but well worth the investment if you at all care about elegant presentation with a more modern flair.</p>

<p>The other thing that is really cool is the shops capability to produce super large prints on virtually any material. I plan on using this capability extensively in the future for some innovative art/commercial applications that I hope to tell you more about soon. Fabric, Dura-trans, plastic, sail cloth, wallpaper, aluminum, you name it. What&#8217;s really nice is that these guys really know their stuff from end to end&#8230; from scanning to printing true professionals that are easy to communicate with and an excellent partner. Have you ever seen one of these???? 100&#8221; wide by practically infinite length. Very cool.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been a while since I have sung the praises of my itty bitty <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_ss_i_0_13%26field-keywords%3Dpanasonic%2520lx5%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%26sprefix%3Dpanasonic%2520lx5&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Panasonic LX5</a>. Back when I got mine last summer my expectations were well tempered based on my search for a small camera that I could actually love in the past. As you might have noticed more than a few illustrations that I have posted have been shot with the LX5&#8230; Not that they are anything special but they look darn good for a little point and shoot in my opinion.</p>

<p>Take a look at the image shot of a <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/04/10/the-giant-print/">print installation</a> I just finished. That shot was not a particularly careful shot. Just some quick tests of our starting ratios for the lighting and to make sure all the flashes were triggering. I had to shoot at ISO 200 f7.1 and f8 as I set up the flashes for the D700 and tilt-shift 24mm we would be shooting the finals with.  What is amazing is that this shot was HAND HELD at 1/6 second and came strait out of the camera with a resize on &#8220;16:9 mode&#8221;. That is freaking amazing considering I shot it in typical arms extended live view and caffeine fueled morning mode. Imagine what you can do with this at f2&#8230; I can do this all day and produce sharp images at 1/6-1/8 second. This thing is a low light machine without reaching for stratospheric ISO&#8217;s I almost never shoot above 200 ISO and 400 still looks really really good. You gotta get one of these things - amazing.</p>

<p>Back on point - as most of you know I almost always shoot RAW+JPEG - storage space is cheap and getting cheaper all the time. Why not. Since day one with this camera I have loaded those RAW+JPEG pairs into Aperture 3 without the ability to process the RAW files up until one of the last camera RAW updates from Apple. Yea I know that happened a while ago - I&#8217;ve been busy. So now that Aperture 3 can process the RAW files for this thing I thought I would offer a couple of my notes on the subject.</p>

<ul>
    <li>If you have LX5 RW2 RAW files loaded into Aperture prior to RAW support for them you must must must select them all and &#8220;reprocess the masters&#8221; in order to have Aperture recognize them. This actually goes for all RAW files that you load into Aperture prior to Apple supporting the format. Just thought I would point that out since it came up in a one-on-one session I had a while back.</li>
    <li>I would rate the RAW processing in Aperture 3 for the LX5 as above average. I will post a quick comparison to SilkyPix soon as that would be considered the &#8220;gold standard&#8221; for Panasonic RW2 files along with a sample from LR3/ACR. I guess one of the reasons I was drawn to the LX5 is that the images have similar properties to Nikon produced JPEG files. As you might expect Aperture renders LX5 RAW files differently than the JPEG&#8217;s produced by the camera. Most notably the blues need more luminance and a shift toward purple to match the JPEG - JUST LIKE NIKON NEF files in Aperture 3.</li>
    <li>Aperture 3 noise reduction control is useless. We all know this and if you are adverse to any image noise you will absolutely need a third party plug in for high ISO LX5 RAW files. Me&#8230; I don&#8217;t care most of my shots are 400 ISO and below and the noise doesn&#8217;t show up in the print. For the odd shot at 1600 It doesn&#8217;t really bother me all that much - they aren&#8217;t supposed to look crisp and clean and bright and sunny in my way of thinking. Bottom line is that LR3&#8217;s new noise reduction is amazingly effective on the LX5 RAW files - Aperture 3 not so much.</li>
    <li>Distortion correction&#8230; I have spent no time figuring out or researching if and how any lens distortions are corrected on the LX5 but I have made assumptions that some sort of distortion correction happens in the camera firmware considering how great the lens looks at all focusing distances at the 24mm wide setting. There is a tiny bit of pin-cushion but not much compared to other wide angles. In any case pin-cushion looks way better than barrel distortion for wide angles. For the most part strait likes are pretty darn strait. Guess what - the RAW files are identical processed in Aperture 3. My guess is that any distortion correction etc happens in the camera to the RAW files as well. Same probably goes for CA based on how good the files look and how closely these lens defects appear (or don&#8217;t appear) in both the RAW and JPEGs. Hooray for Venus FHD or whatever it&#8217;s called. Check it yourself - top image is JPEG bottom is Aperture 3 processed. These were shot at the widest setting very close up.</li>
</ul>

</a></p>

<ul>
    <li>The LX5 has an interesting aspect ratio control that allows you to shoot square, 4:3, 3:2, and 16:9. These aspect ratios show up in the RAW file as well. Very cool. The biggest reason this is cool is these are not merely crops from the &#8220;native 4:3&#8221; sensor. They actually seem to preserve the angle of view - well at least they do in anything &#8220;skinnier than 4:3&#8221;. The square aspect ratio is identical to making a crop of the 4:3 in post production. The first image below is a camera produced 16:9 vs a crop from the 4:3 - subtle but significant. You get more pixels and a wider view from the in camera produced 16:9.</li>
</ul>

</a></p>

<ul>
    <li>The LX5 has much more aggressive sharpening on every JPEG mode than Aperture 3 does on the RAW. There is also a local contrast enhancement that occurs on JPEG files if you are using the LX5&#8217;s &#8220;intelligent resolution&#8221; setting. The closest thing to this in terms of an Aperture 3 adjustment is the definition control combined with edge sharpen. Without this the JPEG&#8217;s look far and away better than the default RAW conversion. Here is a sample RAW on the left JPEG on the right.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Of course you can add that with definition and edge sharpen like so&#8230;</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a couple of things I would like to change on the LX5 but none of them are a deal killer. Believe it or not the biggest thing is that there seems to be no way to turn off the &#8220;pre-flash&#8221; metering pulse from the built in flash. This makes it useless as a trigger for off-camera flash as the slaved units will trigger too soon. The other thing that is very closely related is the ability to manually dial down the flash from full to 1/128 power vs the 2 stops of compensation provided from &#8220;automatic&#8221;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wanted to pass on something about the behavior of Aperture 3 stacks that all of you may not be aware of. If you have been taking advantage of Aperture&#8217;s albums and album-pick features for organizing your images (the key to good work-flow and organization) you can take advantage of a subtlety in the behavior of stacks when you need to delete all of the versions that happen to show up as an album pick in any particular album.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s assume we are starting out with an album that happens to have duplicate versions as album-picks of some images with a set of adjustments applied like this&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/sc3.jpg" rel="lightbox">

</a></p>

<p>In this album all of the image stacks are closed, In most cases this is when stacks are most useful as they are only showing you images at the top of the stack for a particular album. As you can see I have selected all of the images with command-A. If I were to delete all the versions using either the context menu or command-delete every single image version in the stack would go away. This behavior is different that most other things in Aperture like &#8220;duplicate version&#8221; or &#8220;new version from master&#8221;, etc, etc. In these cases Aperture 3 assumes that I only want to affect the versions that are showing at the top of the stack. With delete version Aperture 3 assumes that I want everything to go away.</p>

<p>What happens if I only want the versions at the top of the stack to go away??? Simple enough just open all the stacks via the stack menu or better yet use option-single-quote instead, like this&#8230;</p>

</a></p>

<p>Now with all of the stacks open you can see that only the album-picks are selected. If you delete-versions now using the context menu or command-delete only the album-picks will be deleted. Like so&#8230;</p>

</a></p>

<p>I know this seems a little esoteric to be of much use but it is an important and subtle behavior that not only should all Aperture users be aware of but it actually serves as an illustration as to the power of stacks and album picks when used to their full advantage. The whole point of Aperture&#8217;s stacks/albums/album-picks along with the selection behavior and search tools is to wire them together in ways that suit your own work-flow needs. You will find that once you get used to creating albums with specific album picks for various steps in your work-flow that they can help speed things along quite nicely. I pretty much create a new album for just about every selection I have ever made for any reason. That way I never have to make that selection again or remember what images I did what with and for what reason.</p>

<p>One last thing that I should mention is that it is imperative to set the Aperture preference &#8220;Automatically stack new versions&#8221; for albums and album-picks to be efficiently used. If you are not comfortable with Aperture 3&#8217;s image stacks yet you may want to <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/aperture-ebooks/">check out my e-books&#8230; Specifically the Organization e-book.</a></p>
