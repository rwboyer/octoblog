  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/DSC0072.jpg"><img title="DSC0072.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.DSC0072.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC0072.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" align="left" /></a>Just to test the waters here I thought I would post a basic tutorial on how to get started in &#8220;fine art&#8221; photography. If there is enough interest I will go into some of the more advanced techniques for both this style and cover some other styles as well. I wanted to start simple as not to intimidate anyone considering this is really serious stuff as the term &#8220;fine art&#8221; is intimidating enough.</p>

<p>Okay let&#8217;s dive right in and get right to the meat of it. You can start with any old image I happen to like naked people and this is one of the tougher subjects to get right and really demands a lot of the things that this lesson covers. You can start out with a tree, or a roll of toilet paper if you want but make sure that it is old or broken. Naked people don&#8217;t have to be old or broken as an exception to the rule. So hereÂ  goes:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Load up your image in photoshop, preferably a 16bit image su you can screw with the tonal curve in a big way. JPG is not going to cut it.</li>
    <li>Crop it square. If you shot it with a square camera on film that&#8217;s okay too. It doesn&#8217;t matter, just make sure that you crop it leaving something that should be in the frame sort of part way in and part way out as I did in the example image here at the bottom.</li>
    <li>Create a layer copy and convert it to a smart object. this is key so you can go back into the blurry filter later and change it. Now run a couple of the blurriness filters on it and crank them up really high. For the basic lesson you can use Gaussian blur with the radius really high. Make sure you are having a really hard time figuring out what any of the image is and make sure that If its naked people you cannot actually see any of the naughty bits.</li>
    <li>Adjust the opacity of that layer down just a wee wee bit so some of the basic shapes barely show up, I used about 90% here.</li>
    <li>Now convert it to black and white and screw with the color channel mix until all of the tones are really close together you do not want to make it have too much contrast that is hard to correct later but don&#8217;t worry too much because we are working in 16bitts.</li>
    <li>Now we are getting somewhere - add a new curves layer and whatever you do do not make the blacks black, put a couple of control points in there so that you can leave the shadows where they are and bring down the mid-tones a hair and the highlights too. You want it dark with really compressed mid-tones and highlights about where they are in the example art work. This image could actually go a bit darker for the web but will print on art paper about right.</li>
    <li>Now add a vignette, try the ellipse selection tool, invert the selection, and create an adjustment layer - If you have CS4 you can use the mask tab to blur the mask a whole bunch. Any way you choose to do it make the edges really dark. You can go really a whole lot darker than what I did here if you want - in fact you are probably better at erring on the side of too dark.</li>
    <li>While still in 16 bit mode flatten your image, change the mode to 8 bits. Select a color mode of duotone. I used a stock warm gray preset for this one but go nuts - if you play with the duotone curves you can get all of your darks really dark without screwing up your midtones too much and you get that brownish color that is absolutely required. Neat.</li>
    <li>Now convert back to RGB, convert to sRGB, profile, export it as a JPG and you are done.</li>
</ol>


<p>You do need a catchy title for your image and a fuzzy sort of esoteric theme based name for the project portfolio that you are going to chuck this into along with a bunch of images that have nothing to do with each other. The more enigmatic the title for the portfolio the better. I think I am going to put this in a portfolio with an image that I made of a see-saw and <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2009/06/nikon-d200-gets-wet-real-wet/">my dead fish image</a>.</p>

<p>I am at a loss for this one right now but it will probably go with some thing like &#8220;Loss #19&#8221; or something. You can pick any number you like except really low numbers like 0, 1, etc. I would not go too high with the number though. Just make sure that the title is esoteric so that other people don&#8217;t exactly get it and never ever ever explain it clearly yourself. If you want to sell prints you are going to need an artist statement for each &#8220;portfilio&#8221; or &#8220;body of work&#8221;. This is the same thing just call them portfolio&#8217;s on your website links and &#8220;bodies of work&#8221; when you talk about them. In each artist statement just be vague, esoteric, enegmatic, and somewhat contradictory. This is a tall order but with a little practice it will become natural. Maybe something like &#8220;I was going through a period where brown blurry imges helped me see things much more clearly and opened up a world of color&#8221;, you get it. You will also have to use words like &#8220;silver gelatin&#8221; for black and white prints on photographic paper and words like glicee for ink jets. You have to use archival and limited edition for both kinds of prints though.</p>

<p>Make sure that your website is flash based for no good reason and that you post really really small images like 300 pixels at the longest so that nobody can steel your images.</p>

<p>I am nthinking about some advanced fine art lessons down the road maybe advanced blurrieness or printing really really dark without going black. If you are interested in these kinds of things let me know or my fine art curves presets. If you are interesetd in doing this on film I can provide some step by step lessons as well.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>I really don&#8217;t intend to offend anyone out there. Let me rephase that - I do not intend to offend everyone out there. I don&#8217;t take myself too seriously, I do make fun of everthing and I love South Park.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/DSC_7994.jpg"><img title="DSC_7994.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.DSC_7994.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_7994.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="99" align="left" /></a>Had some interesting philosophical discussions this weekend via email and real in person live Sykpe person to person stuff to. Anyway I felt compelled to share this a few thoughts with loyal readers. Philosophically the motivation for this site for me is education of people that love making photographs. I really get a big charge when I see the &#8220;light bulb turn on&#8221; for someone that was not &#8220;getting it&#8221;. I learned this a while back when I decided to hold a couple of workshops. I learned way before that that 80% of everything you read or hear about photography is nonsense. My main goal is to dispense with that as much as I can. This internet endeavor is NOT a showcase for my work. It is not about an end to end cradle to grave final image product. The images that I choose to display I choose to be illustrative of what I happen to be talking about at the moment.</p>

<p>One of the things that has driven me nuts about sources of information about photography in the past both prior to the internet and even more so after is that by and large photographers show final finished work and only discuss a tiny narrow bit of the technique, process, etc, whatever, and then attribute that tiny little slice as the ONE ingredient to the image. From my point of view this causes all sorts of confusion and frustration for people. There are all sorts of reasons that this happens, some are completely innocent, some are not so innocent and intentionally misleading. <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2008/03/lies-damned-lies-and-statistics/">See my very first post for a small rant on this</a>.</p>

<p>I learned this by being annoyingly tenacious in my early photographic endeavors. I also learned this when doing workshops. When I first started doing them I happened to use my medium format digital system tethered to a top of the line power mac and top of the line cinema display and Phase One software. That is what I happened to be shooting for commercial stuff at the time. This was a bad idea because it had nothing to do with what the workshop was about and was a huge source of distraction considering no matter how much I talked about what was important and what the workshop was about (working with people and models, lighting, dealing with locations) there was way too much focus on the camera and lens and software that I happened to be using. I started using equipment that was &#8220;inferior&#8221; to what attendees brought for themselves to use and guess what - the focus changed, the distraction went away and people focused on what was important with NO little nagging equipment inferiority complexes.</p>

<p>The attacthed images are an example and a metaphor for you to think about and use for your interpretation of information provided not only by me but anywhere that you happen to acquire it. These are shots of my 3 year old daughter watching television, my all time favorite film calibration target. I was shooting them while calibrating my development for Kodak Plus-X developed in PMK pyro film developer in 6x6 format. For my control and comparison I was using my old standby that I calibrated years ago Agfa APX 100 developed in Rodinal. Years ago even today you would hear endless debates between different film stocks, developers etc and all kinds of anicdotal &#8220;properties&#8221; attributed to each of them. Lot&#8217;s of &#8220;illustrative&#8221; images to prove various points that were all completely different, taken under different conditions, of different subjects but attributing those differences to film and developer or a combination of both. No matter what the source of the information - pro, amateur, idiot, whatever - there was an amazing lack of anything remotely scientific or meaningful communicated. There are a million reasons this happens but the bottom line is that most of it is nonsense and you need to see it for yourself and then make sure all of the variables are under your control.</p>

<p>Agfa APX 100 developed in Rodinal shot at ISO 64.</p>

<p>Kodak PXP 125 developed in PMK pyro shot at ISO 64.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2002_003_09.jpg"><img title="2002_003_09.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.2002_003_09.jpg" border="0" alt="2002_003_09.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="148" height="150" /></a></p>

<p>Same thing at 100% 4000 DPI scan.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2002_003_09_crop.jpg"><img title="2002_003_09_crop.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.2002_003_09_crop.jpg" border="0" alt="2002_003_09_crop.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="146" /></a></p>

<p>Both images set the black point to about 12 for the film base black. What do these tell you? The first thing that it should tell you if you know a lot about black and white film is that I am pretty freaking good at calibrating my development process. The most gigantic difference is that in the PXP shot my 3 year old was moving during a relatively long exposure. The second biggest difference is that PXP has higher sensitivity to greens but you wouldn&#8217;t know that unless you knew what colors happened to be in the original shot. The one after that is the grain structure. The rest of the differences in film and devloper go down from there. By the way I abandoned PXP in PMK pyro for a bunch of reasons none of them super important and all very subtle.</p>

<p>I hope some of you find this helpful. I hope that my posting of RAW image files for you to play with, look at, and other &#8220;work product&#8221; type images is educational and informative. If I am talking about film I post a scan of the film NOT of what my interpretation of a print from the film would look like. If I am talking about the way Aperture deals with color and WB for a particular RAW file I post a RAW file NOT what the file looks like with skin fixed and dodged and burned and washed ironed and dried. If I am on the wrong track here please let me know how to do a better job.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2002_016_06.jpg"><img title="2002_016_06.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.2002_016_06.jpg" border="0" alt="2002_016_06.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" align="left" /></a>I think I may be one of like 3 or 4 people that really like shooting square images. Like most photographers alive I started out with 3;2 aspect ratio cameras and learned how to use ever square millimeter of film. Then I got a 4:3 aspect ratio camera and things were pretty much the same. Then I acquired a square format camera that shot 6x6 film.</p>

<p>At first it was a bit hard to get used to. I was constantly distracted by mentally trying to envision the &#8220;normal&#8217; crop inside the square view finder. Somewhere along the line due to a combination of happy accidents and practice and refinement I suddenly started to like composing in a square. Make that loving it, all of a sudden it felt much more free to me. I took the approach of composing the best image that I could inside the square, most of the time it turned out to be my favorite. Other times I was quite liberated that I could crop it to almost any aspect ration that I wanted vertical and horizontal and end up with a fantastic and completely different composition.<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2002_016_06_10x8.jpg"><img title="2002_016_06_10x8.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.2002_016_06_10x8.jpg" border="0" alt="2002_016_06_10x8.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="120" align="right" /></a></p>

<p>This was great, I wonder why digital capture technology never took this approach as the number of pixels has grown - maybe it will. Yea I know about the Hasselblad &#8220;V System&#8221; digital backs, I have one from a generation or so back but rarely use it. Today there is a good chance that you are shooting 3;2. If you crop it to a different aspect ratio that happens to be in the same orientation that you were holding the camera it&#8217;s okay. Want a square? That is dicey. Want an orientation opposite the way you held the camera - good luck - you are getting rid of most of the image data.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2002_016_06_8x10.jpg"><img title="2002_016_06_8x10.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.2002_016_06_8x10.jpg" border="0" alt="2002_016_06_8x10.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="120" height="150" align="left" /></a>The logic behind the square was crop it either way and lose not too much of the image data. The square optimized to take maximum advantage of the size of the image circle size of lenses that you were carrying around. Theoretically you could do this with existing lenses for 3:2 and end up with a square image of the same width/height dimensions - ie add sensor area - 3:2 lenses produce a big enough image circle. You would need new lens shades.</p>

<p>Just a passing thought. Anyone else out there missing the square? I still shoot my square camera quite a bit but really would love a more affordable solution as a carry around camera.</p>

A scan with no adjustments to black point at full resolution in a non compressed format would kill my server bandwidth for days.How about the next best thing an completely nude except for a conversion to 8bits and save as JPG <code>[download#8#size]</code> . Let us just chalk this up to a grain fetish or something. Have fun.</p>

Well maybe not everyone but most people that have been using a camera for more than a week. One reaction is either the conscious or subconscious decision not to make images during the mid-day doldrums. The other is to instantly turn on the auto fill flash - heck most consumer cameras automatically do this for you. For some of you searching to make better images at mid-day you can also go read up at some other sites on how to make use of old used hotshoe flashes for $4.25 and save a lot of money while looking at example images made in the Sahara desert with 14 assistants and 12 ganged SB-900 flashes, and a bunch of large diffusers, stands, etc.</p>

<p>Here is a more simple approach that will apply even if you decide to add additional light sources to the mix. The keyword here is decide. Deciding how to use the light that you have on hand is the key to making consistent images in just about any circumstance. They mght start out as consistently bad but that is good. You can modify one thing at a time until they are consistently good. Auto fill flash has it&#8217;s place and may make &#8220;useable&#8221; images that would have been unuseable if you didn&#8217;t have it but for for the most part using it with no attention to what else is going on with light in the image will not result in great results. In fact I think auto fill flash really get&#8217;s in the way of most people learning how to deal with light by making them numb to what is really going on in the scene. I see fabulous images that use fill flash all the time in National Geographic and other places. The one thing that they have in common is that the photographer made decisions about the rest of the scene as well.</p>

<p>When the sun is really high there are a couple of things to watch for that wilth a tiny little bit of practice will pay off big time for you down the road no matter whether you decide to use fill flash, a reflector, or add another light source. A technique that I use all the time is using the sun as an accent light. Meaning position the subject (or yourself) in such a way that the sun acting like a hair light or edge light to provide separation and not the primary source of illumination for your subject. This works great for just about any circumstance and has two main variations. The first being every thing in the background is also lit by the sun and goes way bright compared to the subject - this can actually work for a lot of things by de-emphasize the background.</p>

<p>You go this direction you cannot be timid you really want to let the background go and lot&#8217;s of things will be &#8220;blown out&#8221; technically speaking but in a lot of circumstances it&#8217;s a who care proposition and there was nothing back there that you needed or wanted lots of detail. You will get a sense of what is going on. I have seen a really high end wedding photographer on the west coast that makes a living with this technique and her images are way better than the typical auto fill flash wedding crap that I see most of the time with perfectly detailed and exposed subject and background where both subject and background have really crappy light. The background has high noon light and the subject has crappy on camera flash light. Wonderful.</p>

<p>The other direction you can go using the sun as an accent light is with a background that is not lit by the sun but lit by the sky. This in general will give you a very high degree of separation between subject and background. This is a much more common scenario than you might think. Just take a look around next time you are outside at mid-day and note the infinte variations of backgrounds that are in the shade - cant&#8217;f find one - turn around and look the other way. The image at the top of the post is that circumstance.</p>

<p>So is this one. I screwed this up from a little bit from a timing perspective but she was walking toward me very fast and there was a very small window as she was walking into the shade to get the sun off of her face but still acting as a rim light. Hey I am not HCB but I will bet you he would consider this a keeper to.<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2001_051_16.jpg"><img title="2001_051_16.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.2001_051_16.jpg" border="0" alt="2001_051_16.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="102" height="150" align="right" /></a></p>

<p>One other note - your DSLR will probably get this exposure wrong. Maybe not but it will be a hit or miss thing. Most of the time your DSLR on evaluative metering will do everything in its&#8217;s power to keep from blowing out the highlights - what you really want is to spot meter the face of your subject that is not in the sun and open up for about a stop more exposure (Zone VI) or so depending on the skin tone of your subject and what feeling you want in the image.</p>

<p>The key here is to look at what is going on with the light in the scene and make conscious decisions about how you are going to handle it. After a little practice and the wonderfulness of quick feedback with digital this will be come second nature to you. Your pictures will thank you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well I finally did it. After years of holding out on Adobe I finally broke down and upgraded my Adobe CS to CS4. Yep I have held out since upgrading to CS, not CS2, not CS3, plain old CS. I really was disappointed with CS, I really didn&#8217;t see the point after I upgraded from PS 7. I guess it was a little better but cost a lot of money. Then came C2. By the time I had time to even consider upgrading I had Intel based Macs. There was no way I was going to pay for and upgrade that ran in emulation mode on my new machines at the same speed that It ran on my old machines. No freaking way. By the time CS3 came around there was nothing in it compelling for me, I didn&#8217;t do nearly as much commercial work as I used to and had no personal projects that screamed for anything it did. I guess smart objects would have been a time and space saver IF I was jacking around making cartoons for public consumption but I wasn&#8217;t at the time.</p>

<p>Fast forward - I heard a bunch of places that CS4 was really really good. So what? Well I finally started working on something that screamed for features that were in CS3 but kind of clunky and came into their own in CS4 (more on those later). I guess that was the primary motivator. The distant secondary and subliminal motivator were the emails I receive every other day telling me the ticker is running out on my ability to &#8216;save money&#8217; by upgrading soon.</p>

<p>Guess what. CS4 IS fantastic on new hardware. It is fast, most of the functionality for 16bit images actually is there and workable on 500 Megabyte Tiff files, Bridge is absolutely fantastic for a &#8216;free&#8217; afterthought. Actually it is like Lightroom lite. Did I mention it is fast - like really fast. I cannot wait to see the Snow Leopard update (big assumption Adobe will give this away for free). The interface changes will probably bother a lot of long time users. They are taking me a bit to get used to but guess what - that is only due to habit. Finally this thing is actually getting UI changes that are good - it&#8217;s been since like the mid 90&#8217;s or something since anything real significant has been really improved.</p>

<p>Bottom line If you are on the fence this is one upgrade that is worth every penny. I usually get all of my stuff at Amazon. If you want to help offset my costs for running this mess please use the little Amazon or B+H links on the side or on the sponsors page.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/1997003_31.jpg"><img title="1997003_31.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.1997003_31.jpg" border="0" alt="1997003_31.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="102" height="150" align="left" /></a>I loved this stuff when it came out in both the regular old S and the SW varieties. It completely replaced Kodachrome 64 for my personal use, as well as replaced regular Ektachrome Pro (EPP) and a bunch of different constantly changing Fuji stuff for my commissioned work. The new Ektachrome G films are similar and just as good, maybe even &#8220;better&#8221;.</p>

<p>Ektachrome 100S was by no means a loud film like Fuji Velvia (never took a liking to that stuff myself but shot it when requested). You could use it on people,Â  you could use it on anything. Here it is in the 35mm regular old S variety. Check out how smooth the grain is at 4000 DPI. Amazing. That is why my eyes roll into the back of my head when listening to endless debates aobut &#8220;noise&#8221; at ISO 800, 1600, and beyond. Are you kidding me? Again no sharpening, a little unsharp mask and the detail even from these hand held casual shots is blistering. Post adjustments were to black point only to get the flim base to true black.<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/1997003_31___Version_2.jpg"><img title="1997003_31___Version_2.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.1997003_31___Version_2.jpg" border="0" alt="1997003_31___Version_2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" align="right" /></a></p>

<p>This chrome was shot with a Nikon F2AS and a so-so 35mm f2.0 lens around f8. Hyperfocalish focus point somewhere behind the flowers in the foreground. I hated that lens compared to my Leica 35mm Summicron but I was shooting some telephoto shots as well and didn&#8217;t want to carry around two kits. I guess there are worse lenses on the planet, like the abyssmal Nikon 24-50. Don&#8217;t get me wrong they are fine for 6x9 prints, actualy flawless except for distortion but dogs at larger than 11x14. Checkout the chromatic abberation in the shot of the dome against the sky. I never noticed this with a 10x loupe.</p>

I don&#8217;t even know where to begin. I don&#8217;t know who is responsible for this atrocity. I have seen some dogs lately in terms of things that are supposed to be photographs on the cover of Time Magazine but this takes the prize for the most aweful. Is this the art director&#8217;s fault, is this what he or she wanted?</p>

<p>What the hell is this? It looks like a 5 year old with a point and shoot shot the image and then a 7 year old was plopped in front of Photoshop and given some sort of directions to make it look &#8220;better&#8221;. Is this supposed to be a character portrait? The sad part is this image was probably shot with a massively expensive rig capable of capturing amazing detail, lit with the latest and greatest Profoto gear, proofed on the best technology money can buy and then subjected to death by commitee for even more money and equipment overkill just to end up with something that is not only a terrible photograph by any measure but one that could have been shot with any camera using really bad light and then touched up by the newest Photoshop neophite hack with bad taste in under 30 seconds start to finish.</p>

<p>I must be getting old or everyone else on the planet is getting really dumb. S0mething really bad is happening here. This suck so bad I cannot even believe anyone has the audacity to show this image anywhere let alone on a widely circulated freaking print magazine. Have all of our collective standards and minds gone on permenant vacation?</p>

<p>What the hell am I missing?</p>

I took a ride in a Zodiak the other day and we got swamped while I was carrying a D200 around my shoulder with a Nikon 12-24 AFS lens on my shoulder. I mean this was a lot of water, a whole lot all at once. Now I have had my D2H&#8217;s, my D2x&#8217;s (before they were liberated from me), and my D3 get wet and based on experience with my D2H&#8217;s never really worried about it. The D200 has seen a very short life with me and they still look like new. I bought them when my D2x&#8217;s (both of them) were stolen and that not even a year before I got the D3.Â  So they really haven&#8217;t seen much of the world - heck I think that one has under 10K exposures on it.</p>

<p>Back on point - the D200 get real wet and I was a little worried that It might have seen it&#8217;s life cut a little short. Nothing to dry it off with when we arrived on shore considering everything was wet. So with the D200 quite literally still dripping I fired off a couple of shots of the closest interesting subject. A big dead fish - I think it&#8217;s a carp?</p>

<p>Just wanted to give you the first hand report that these things are built very very well and don&#8217;t give up the ghost easily.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2002_006_05_nx.jpg"><img title="2002_006_05_nx.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.2002_006_05_nx.jpg" border="0" alt="2002_006_05_nx.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" align="left" /></a>Let me start out by saying that Ilford HP5 plus was not one of my favorite films. I would much rather shoot TX or TXP, that&#8217;s Kodak Tri-X in 35mm and medium format. The one and only one exception is HP5 plus in medium format or large format developed in one of a few different pyro developer formulations.</p>

<p>For those not familiar with pyro development it has some unique properties. It is sort of a compensating developer, meaning that it develops more in the shadows and exhausts quickly in the highlights when used in high dilutions with minimum agitation. So you can get a negative with good detail thoughout the exposure range. Negatives have a very long tonal scale. Pyro is high acutance, meaning it did not dissolve the edges of the film grain and exhibited the mackie effect to some degree (enhanced edges between areas of high contrast), sort of like an automatic unsharp mask. Last but not least the image densities were composed of both silver and dye stain. The reason I used HP5 plus with pyro was specifically for the staining characteristics that the film had relative to other films and the speed. Pyro was not really a high speed developer you could expect the films sensitivity to go down almost a stop compared with other developers.<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2002_006_05_nx_crop1.jpg"><img title="2002_006_05_nx_crop1.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.2002_006_05_nx_crop1.jpg" border="0" alt="2002_006_05_nx_crop1.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" align="right" /></a></p>

<p>The image staining was amazing in that it added to the acutance effects but masked the grain structure giving you a very smooth super sharp image effect. It also acted as a variable built in contrast mask as densities on the film when up the dye stain became stronger in proportion. The stain was yellow-green, it so happens that blue light on variable contrast black and white paper makes the contrast go up, filtering blue out makes the contrast go down. When printing a pyro stained negative on VC paper there was a unique and beautiful easy to print fantatically detailed highlights almost automatically. Pyro stained negatives also looked fantastic on graded papers and had characteristics the same as any negative even though they looked &#8220;thin&#8221; due to some of the image density being made up of dye stain. Pyro also had amazing tonal gradation, using my scanner and todays display technologies you are only going to see a tiny tiny representation of tones that they reproduce.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2002_006_11.jpg"><img title="2002_006_11.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.2002_006_11.jpg" border="0" alt="2002_006_11.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" align="left" /></a>The downside of this is scanning pyro developed negatives are a bitch because they react completely differently than they do printing on paper. I have tried a few times but have given up on making them look similar to what they look like on black and white paper. If anyone out there has experience with scanning and processing pyro developed negatives I would love for you to share the recipe with me. There is no comparison, so for educational purposes here are a few shots of HP5 plus and some random 100% crops. No sharpening, blackpoint to true dmax black, that&#8217;s it. As usual there are some film flatness issues when viewing at 100% as well as the reality of &#8220;depth of field&#8221; with medium format.<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2002_006_11_crop2.jpg"><img title="2002_006_11_crop2.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.2002_006_11_crop2.jpg" border="0" alt="2002_006_11_crop2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" align="right" /></a></p>

<p>Shot with a Hasselblad 503CW - 80mm Zeiss CF - hand held 1/60 f4 and 1/125 f2.8. Maybe I will get around to playing around with it when I can retire, I feel confident that it has something to do with treating the the color channels differently than the greyscale as a whole and then combining them so that the stain does the same thing for the scanned image as it does for printing on black and white paper. In reality I have not shot HP5 plus or printed it in at least 3 years and probably won&#8217;t unless I get a hankering to fire up a darkroom again someday. I occasionally develop some film but have not been set up for prints in about 3 years.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2002_006_07_crop1.jpg"><img title="2002_006_07_crop1.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.2002_006_07_crop1.jpg" border="0" alt="2002_006_07_crop1.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" align="left" /></a>I guess if you can take in some of the words that I sputtered on about, convert that into some sort of visual filter, and use your imagination you may be able to get an idea of the beauty of this film and developer combination. Check out the detail in the sheer fabric that is picked up at 100%. Realize how small that is in both reality and in the full image, holy crap. Even with this crappy scan a typical sharpening would make this pop. You can sort of get a feeling for the delicate way that it handles highlights looking at this crop from the face.</p>

<p>I still have a couple of bricks of this stuff in the downstairs fridge. If you ever get a hankering to play with pyro I would absolutely recommed HP5 plus as the film to do it with. Start with very minimal agitations, like one inverstion ever minute. If the film hasn&#8217;t changed much since that last time I shot it you will probably see a real ISO of around 200 to 250. Do not shoot this at 400 no matter what the claim of the purveyer of the development formula. I personally have never seen a pyro developer get 400 out of HP5 plus. I guess if you were to really use long development times that would make it unsuitable for printing on graded papers you might get 400 as measured in the midtones but never the shadows at Zone III.</p>

<p>If your lacking inspiration lately and find your digital photographic life a little too <a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2002_006_07.jpg"><img title="2002_006_07.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.2002_006_07.jpg" border="0" alt="2002_006_07.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" align="right" /></a>complicated grab yourself a spot meter some medim format film and one of a dozen fabulous 6x6, 6x4,5, or 6x7 systems that can be had for a song on eBay. Find a willing subject and a window and enjoy. Don&#8217;t be afraid of a normal lens - this was all shot on with a &#8220;normal&#8221; 80mm and I had a gaggle of other lenses to choose from. It doesn&#8217;t get much better than this. I guarantee you will have a blast, probably create some really nice images, and learn a whole lot that will carry forward to your digital life. Maybe even simplifying it in the process.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps I am serious about hearing from people that have got the pyro negative scanning thing in the bag. I have about 10,000 pyro negatives that I cannot bear to output digitally because my feeble attempts don&#8217;t even come close to my traditional silver prints and I am not one of those people that pooh-pooh digital capture or output.</p>
