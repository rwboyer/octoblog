  <div class="entry-content"><p>Part of the Aperture 3 - SuperSimpleStuff™ series.</p>

<p>If you have referenced files on one or more drives there is a good chance that sooner or later you will need to use Aperture 3&#8217;s <em>locate referenced files</em> function. A reader contacted me a few days ago with a very common scenario. He had a drive full of referenced master files that was starting to fail. Thankfully he had an exact copy of that drive as a backup - as we all <em>should</em> have.</p>

<p>It had a intricate folder hierarchy that he had created over time that was also reproduced on his backup drive. His question was how to <em>make</em> Aperture 3 use the backup drive instead of the failing drive. He was having some trouble so I gave him a few suggestions. I hope everything turned out well for him and he is back up and running. I thought it might be a good time to review how to &#8220;reconnect&#8221; referenced master image files in Aperture 3.</p>

<p>For demonstration purposes let&#8217;s assume you have a drive with a folder structure such as this conatining your referenced masterfiles.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/HD.jpg"></p>

<p>Everything is humming along, you, Aperture 3, and your photos are doing just fine Then one day you see something like this. Uh-oh - s%@t. Now what?</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Ap3-missing.jpg"></p>

<p>Assuming you have a copy of that drive, let&#8217;s call it &#8220;HD-bck&#8221; for this example. The first thing you may want to do is unmount or eject that drive using <em>disk utility</em> if it still shows up in the finder, just so that you can sort the wheat from that chaf. This is especially true if you have multiple drives of referenced images in which case you will want to focus on just the images that have masters on the failing drive. If the drive is quesiton is wholy off-line then obviously this will be sorted for you.</p>

<p>The next thing you want to do is go to the <em>photos</em> view in the browser and open up the <em>search HUD</em>. Add a new <em>file status</em> criteria from the <em>add rule</em> drop down menu. Make sure you set the criteria for that new rule to <em>off-line</em> and that the rule is checked. You may also want to make sure that there are no other criteria restricting the search.</p>

<p>You should end up with all of the images that have off-line referenced master files showing up in the browser like this.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Ap3-search.jpg"></p>

<p>Using the <em>edit</em> menu or Cmd+A select all of the images. Open up the <em>Locate referenced files</em> dialog from the file menu. At this point your screen should look something like this.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Ap3-locate1.jpg"></p>

<p>On the top half of the locate dialog you will see all of the images that were selected when the dialoag was activatied. These should be the images that now have off-line master files. On the bottom half of the dialog you should see a list of devices and folders. The goal is to navigate to the appropriate image file on the bottom of that dialog that matches the image selected at the top of the dialog.</p>

<p>Assuming that your backup drive has the same folder structure as the failed drive this should be easy as the folder structure you are looking for is listed in the top half of the dialog. There is also the image itself as well as some important metadata for you to compare and verify against the image that you navigate to. When you have navigated to the corresponding master file on the bottom this is what you should see.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Ap3-locate2.jpg"></p>

<p>The <em>reconnect all</em> button should become active as long as you matched up the one image with what Aperture believes is the correct master file associate with this image. Now just use that <em>reconnect all</em> button. Aperture should reconnect every image that was selected when you opened the <em>locate referenced files</em> dialog. There are many cases where it will not reconnect every file but many of them. If this is the case the files that are still off-line will still show up in the browser search that is active. Make sure you click somewhere to de-select the images that were selected so that Aperture will refresh the search and show only the images remaining off-line. Repeat the select all / locate steps described until all of the files are reconnected. This may take a few iterations but the number of off-line files will be less every iteration. When you are finished there will be no files that still show up in the search.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Ap3-after.jpg"></p>

<p>This kind of thing and much more is covered from soup to nuts in my <em><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/aperture-ebooks/">Aperture 3 File Management eBook</a></em>. If you run into a situattion that is more complicated than this I may be able to help you get things set strait again as I offer one-on-one assistance via phone and screensharing.</p>

<p>I hope this helps some of you that have not really understood how <em>locate referenced files</em> works in Aperture 3</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sorry for the random posts last evening and this morning. Some failed hacking attempt left a feature on my blogging platform (turd-press) maimed. It is sorta-fixed but not completely fixed. No big deal but this is the kind of thing that really puts some energy into my distasted for WordPress. Yes everyone uses it. Yes There are a lot of things done that you don&#8217;t have to do. Yes I hate it.</p>

<p>From a software engineering standpoint I never really was in love with PHP - when I saw the state of the &#8220;PHP community&#8221; I was really shocked and horrified. It&#8217;s very difficult to tell the wheat from the chaff but that is another story. At the end of the day it sure does motivate me to move to another platform. I love posterous&#8217; design and technology but hate the way a few things are implemented that are important to me (not technically as it would be easy for them to allow what I would prefer), Tmblr - maybe now that you can use disqus, or a stripped down, <a href="http://rwboyer.github.com/2011/01/nginx.html">down and dirty good ol&#8217; static content generator</a> with some cool tricky web 2.x stuff chucked in for integration. HAML for templating, CSS, and Markdown for content wrinting/posting via iA Writer, Byword, Vi, Darkroom, whatever - maybe even some not-so-tricky git-trickiness for auto content generation and posting.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. I actually got comments on the &#8220;WTF&#8221; post by the time I deleted it. Who woulda thought?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/milkieroad/tags/canonetql17giii/">I ran across this guy&#8217;s Flickr photostream</a> in some random clicking today.I think his photographs are extremely interesting and attractive. Great stuff and worth a look for just about anyone into any sort of photography but especially if you are into documentary/art. This guy absolutely knows what the hell he is doing in terms of taking photographs.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the punchline and the rationale for the title of the post. The page I linked to are just the images shot/tagged with a Canonet Q17 G-III. For those of you that have no idea what this is let me give you a brief run down. It is a 1970&#8217;s fixed lens - fixed focal length - 35mm film rangefinder. I have one a lot like it - my very very first camera - the Ricoh G-500. Think Fuji X100 only &#8220;full frame FX&#8221; and you need to load beautifully designed and manufactured film cassettes into it every 36 pictures.</p>

<p>These cameras and ones very similar can be had for a song on eBay but that is not the point - these cameras are very very simple and very very cheap antiques - load some newer emulsions into them like Kodak Ektar 100 or Kodak Portra and take even better pictures than they did almost 40 years ago with better hit rates due to improved latitude - better color - sharper - less grain - etc.</p>

<p>If someone gave me an X100 would I take it? Yes. Have I spent my money on one? NO. Same with the Leica M9. After having been through countless digital cameras (yes I still own and use some of them) from the D2h and D2x to the Hasselblad H2 with Leaf back and everything in between, I have always had a gee-whiz ain&#8217;t this fantastic reaction - and then reality sets in when I find myself longing for the next version that will be more like what I already had with my film cameras&#8230;. Either handling wise or some certain characteristic having to do with image quality, or something. I can tell you from the ONE X100 I handled it&#8217;s fatal flaw in my mind was the fiddly focusing and the DX frame - DX is too small to render the image they way I like it too look w/ respect to DOF at any given perspective in the range of focal length&#8217;s that I like to shoot. I swear I would rather something more like the Canonet and spend 1000+ on film at this point. It would give me more joy, most likely better images, and I would feel no need to solve it&#8217;s issues and short comings by upgrading to the X200.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As most of you know, it&#8217;s been a long time since I have actually photographed anything that could remotely be called a project. To burn&#8217;t out from anything remotely feeling like a project or even sounding like one. I have kept an ongoing list of things that have crossed my mind that might make for interesting personal projects.</p>

<p>Some items on this list have come from nowhere as I am drinking a cup of coffee. Some of them come from direct observation of subject matter sans camera that seems like I would be interesting to explore further - mostly documentary in nature. In other cases I will actually set out to photograph something completely different. Not anything that really interests me that much - definitely not &#8220;project worthy&#8221; and I happen to take a picture that later gives me ideas that have nothing to do with why I was photographing in the first place.</p>

<p>Over the weekend I ventured out into the local woods with a photographer friend of mine. The primary purpose was to help / coach him on his 4x5 view camera endeavors. Of course I brought my camera with me - mostly to make a couple images of him using his 4x5 camera. When we arrived at a suitable location I was intrigued at the number and diversity of people sprinkled around this spot in the middle of nowhere. He was of course annoyed as he like is landscape scenes sans people. When I saw this image I just had to take it. The scene only lasted about 30 seconds, I was way way too far away even with a 135mm lens that was in my bag. I was perched on a rock and had a hard time keeping steady. Even worse I had no room to move or recompose. I shot two of the frames and then it was gone.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/2011-006-17cn-as-Smart-Object-1.jpg"></p>

<p>The image is okay but the trip into the woods, my interest in the diversity of people there, and this image suggested two projects that I feel compelled to do. The first one is a lifestyle/fashion shoot in the many similar locations like this around the area. Grab a couple of models - someone to hold reflectors - and shoot. The location in combination with the heavy, humid air suggests summer as well as the vegetation and offers something way off the beaten track as compared to beachy type fashion but suggests a similar feeling. A great project right up my ally for the summer.</p>

<p>The other project it suggests is a documentary project about summertime swimming holes - they people that gather there - and the diversity of their age/background/ethnicity as well as activities. I have a number of grab shots of this type of thing from this summer already so something is nagging me to shoot this them.</p>

<p>One thing I am going to do as I dip my toe back into doing anything remotely similar to a project is to have some hard limitations to it&#8217;s scale and intent. I am seriously thinking of limiting projects right now to ONE 36 exposure roll of 35mm film or one roll of 120 film if it is a static subject. This should keep me out of trouble, focused, and most importantly having a good time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A lot of my one on one help sessions are for photographers that are migrating their library to Aperture for the first time. They are typically migrating either from iPhoto or from a self organized library of file system folders. The thing that they all have in common is the primary organization has been by date. Something along the lines of folder for year, folder for month, folder for date, etc. This makes sense in a lot of ways. In fact it most likely mirrors what they did in the old days of physical filing of negatives.</p>

<p>Heck I still file my film physically by date and the file name of the scan links that image back to the physical negative file ordered by year, roll number/sheet number, and image number. When you have a physical thing it can only exist in one place so you <em>must</em> pick some one way to order and organize groups of those things - date makes sense.</p>

<p>Fast forward to the digital age and databases with metadata and tools like Aperture 3. Maybe just maybe organizing and ordering your projects in Aperture by date doesn&#8217;t make the most sense any more. I have been of this mindset since I started using Aperture way back in the old days. I know that this topic is sometimes like a religious war but here me out before you decide.</p>

<p>In many ways the way you organize projects and folders of projects in Aperture is really just additional metadata. Not a whole lot different than any other metadata like EXIF info, keywords, GPS, etc. The only thing really different about it is that it has some built in views and shortcuts that don&#8217;t exist for all meta data in the inspector. Since project names and folder names as well as their relationships are just some more metadata it doesn&#8217;t seem to make a whole lot of sense mirroring metadata you already have in each and every image to group them together. This is already done for you automatically every time you press the shutter button.</p>

<p>Aperture 3 makes it easy to look at your images organized by date in numerous different ways no matter how you choose to name and organize your projects. If you Go to the all projects view you have a couple of controls and options at the top of the browser window that will do this&#8230;.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/ss1-full.jpg"></p>

<p>The first drop down menu controls ordering the view by name, date, or like the library in the inspector is ordered. That&#8217;s pretty self explanatory but a lot of people I have talked to never really noticed or used these controls before. They set them one way and leave it that way. The best way to use Aperture is to change the UI to suit what you are trying to do at the moment. The next group of icons to the right are much more interesting. They change the way the browser works completely for the all projects view.  The first one is the boring default view. The second one is great if you want a quick view partitioned by year. No matter what you choose in the drop down for ordering the second icon groups your projectsby year when you choose this the drop down controls the ordering inside the year grouping of projects. Last will group your projects by the folders you created.</p>

<p>Personally I organize my projects by broad genre - portrait, fashion, travel, family, etc. These are my top level folders. Underneath those I do whatever makes sense - folders for each client, folders for holidays, birthdays, etc. Finally I name my projects that has something to do with why I made the images and/or what is in the pictures. The practical reason for my deciding to do this was that ordering anything in any Aperture view by date is trivial but having the ability to restrict search context by genre for ad-hoc searches or smart albums has saved me a ton of time even without <em>perfect</em> metadata. Trust me nobody&#8217;s metadata is perfect. Think searching for &#8220;Emma&#8221; where there are nine Emmas in my library - portrait clients, fashion models, my daughter&#8230; Having the ability to do a quick search for Emma in the context of my family folder or my birthdays sub-folder has proven to be amazingly effective for me.</p>

<p>I certainly am agnostic about any particular way a photographer chooses to organize their library if date is the best way for you great. My goal is to present an alternative since getting to anything in Aperture via date, date range, or ordering by date is so very easy why not use that folder/project naming metadata for something other than to duplicate information built into every image. My <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2010/08/15/aperture-organization/">Organization e-book</a> is chock full of thoughts that even experienced Aperture users will find interesting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a conversation with my oldest daughter on Saturday (she&#8217;s expecting) about taking pictures of the new addition. I am going to supply her with film as well as take care of the processing, scanning, and printing. Se already has all the equipment she needs - An old manual focus Nikon and a couple of large aperture prime lenses. She was concerned about focusing and not having AF&#8230;</p>

<p>To make a long story short my children were born when AF started to get good with the Nikon F4. I naively believed that would be the silver bullet to shoot children - nope. After buying better and better and faster and faster bodies and AF-S lenses I ended up shooting all of the best images on my F2 and F3 manual focus cameras. In fact my very first AF-S lens, the 28-70 AF-S f 2.8 was bought specifically to solve the &#8220;kids move fast amd don&#8217;t sit still&#8221; issue. I quickly discovered that a different approach was required rather than improving the AF systems speed was the answer. I discovered that the best people pictures are usually close up at large apertures - an area where AF is really not that helpful.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong - you have to have confidence in your focus ability and not be back and fourth back and fourth to make sure. You really have to practice focusing and shutter release as a continuous coordinated manner along with some other techniques that I discovered. More about that some other day if anyone gives a hoot and has not worked it out for themselves yet. Just wanted to share a few images from a roll of film I had processed today - shot a few days ago of my niece. She is a perpetual motion machine 24x7. I am used to toddlers but she is in the 99th percentile of continuous random motion.</p>

<p>Keep in mind these are CrappyScans™ from Walgreens which are worse than my CrappyScans™ from the Nikon 8000ED. Shot with a Nikon FE and single coated 50 f1.4 wide open on $1/roll fuji consumer print film. Not too bad for a sub $100 kit in mint condition.</p>

<p>I felt compelled to shoot this short series based on my observation through 9 baby girls in my immediate family that the shoe thing has to be built in from the start.</p>

<p>The focus plane - my fault not the lens&#8217; - is a bit off as you can see in this one but I don&#8217;t really care the look is classic. Click on the image for a larger view&#8230;</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/23650017.jpg"></p>

<p>Skin is easy with film. One complaint I have always had with digital is skin.</p>

<p>You have to respect the determination here. The funny thing is she can actually run full speed in these things for the last year or so&#8230;</p>

<p>I really need to spend a full day or so with my brother&#8217;s girls and a camera - I spend maybe a minute or two every few months pointing the camera at them. I am definitely putting it on my list of things that must be done before the summer is out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yes, shooting film brings good luck. When was the last time you paid for one thing digital and got five? Well the mail delivery person showed up today with a film order from Adorama - I actually ordered through Amazon but the order was fulfilled by Adoroma. I ordered 1 pro-pack of Kodak Portra 160 35mm and got n5 pro-packs so that&#8217;s 25 rolls for the price of 5.</p>

<p>At first I though I might have screwed up and actually ordered 5 but when I looked at the receipt in my email it was clear - I bought one and paid for one but got 5. Wow. There was some language on the packing list that said something about the SKU number and the quantity of 5 of that SKU. Turns out there is some sort of wire cross on the SKU vs price vs quantity between Amazon and Adorama - I would <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LM6UJC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B000LM6UJC">highly advise you might want to try this particular link</a> if you want to see if it has been &#8220;fixed&#8221; yet. There is more than a slim chance they have not figured it out and you will also get 5 for the price of 1. I say this because the SKU they referenced is for the pro-pack on Adorama&#8217;s packing list&#8230;.</p>

<p>I cannot link directly to the Adorama vendor for this item so you will have to navigate to it yourself. Just click the &#8220;three new&#8221; link and choose the Adorama add to cart button. Good Luck.</p>

<p>Worst case is they fixed the snafu and you get one at a good price.</p>

<p>Remember - luck smiles on film shooters anyway.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I ended up shooting some images of my communities July 4th picnic. Typically my approach to any photographic project or endeavor is to focus on one subject and optimize for light and composition first then after that is covered I would more or less direct or construct the scene in front of my camera. You can probably see why I am not a landscape photographer with that kind of mindset.</p>

<p>This time I took a completely different approach and of course made completely different images than I would normally make. I took a far more casual approach. I directed nothing. I shot from a viewpoint of wherever I happened to be standing at a distance I happened to be at with a fixed focal length lens whenever something caught my eye. I tried not to even think about the light or repositioning myself for a better composition. I just put the camera to my eye and made the best out of it as quickly as possible. This is probably more along the lines of the way a street photographer operates. Completely foreign to my thought process.</p>

<p>At the end of the day I would have to rate my shots by any of my preconceived notions as complete failures. This is by my own internal set of criteria that I use when I look at an endeavor as a project shot for a client. Now if I back off that highly commercial set of criteria that I had developed for myself in a completely different context for a completely different purpose there are quite a few images that I do find interesting with no particular reason or rationale in mind. I do think that I will continue refining this approach but with a more coherent theme for some of my own projects that I have on my long list of things I would like to shoot.</p>

<p>I shot most of the shots on a Nikon FE in manual using an ancient single coated 50mm f1.4. Some of the images were shot on 10 year old, mistreated <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009XVZ5/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B00009XVZ5">Kodak Portra 400 NC</a>. Some on $1/roll <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004TWLY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B00004TWLY">Fujicolor 200
</a></p>

<p>. A few of them on the Sigma SD14 with 28mm f1.8. Here are a smattering of random images that I found interesting. There are a bunch more - maybe better - maybe not. I have about 30 images flagged as interesting that I will probably live with for a while before I decide if I want to spend time doing a better scan and fixing the color and tone. These are the default crappy scans from Walgreens.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/21910019.jpg"></p>

<p>Something about this image intrigues me. In fact it continues to suggest a few different project ideas to me and even informs me on an approach to more controlled environmental fashion or lifestyle work.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/21910004.jpg"></p>

<p>I have a few different shots that generally have this same point of view and compositional elements throughout the day. Not sure why I find it interesting but I can tell you I would have never made this composition if I had a zoom lens. I know exactly what I would have shot with a longer focal length and it would not have interested me in the least but may have been technically more acceptable.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/21930001.jpg"></p>

<p>Love the bike at the beach. Love the way film deals with the 6 stop difference between the grass in the foreground and sunlit background. I massively overexposed the background as I metered off the grass that was under a shade tree. Shot at f2.8 if memory serves. Would have shot even shallower but was limited to 1/1000s with the 200 speed film.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/SDIM0514.jpg"></p>

<p>Ya gotta love the looks of these bikers - don&#8217;t think the boys club was expecting a girl to show up in their front line.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/21940014.jpg"></p>

<p>Love the curiosity of the little people</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/21940011.jpg"></p>

<p>Even without proper color balance I cannot ever stop loving the way Kodak Portra renders skin.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/SDIM0554.jpg"></p>

<p>This little girl was amazing - she changed moods from this to jubilant so quickly you wouldn&#8217;t believe it. All day, either this or joy. Is this some sort of early training program that males don&#8217;t seem to receive?</p>

<p>I spent the day relaxed and participating fully in all of the events and talking with the people around me, not in photographer mode. About the only thing I did in preparation or follow through is to have my camera with me. I did learn one thing - I brought too much gear. It was right down the street so I didn&#8217;t carry it very far but once I got there the only thing I carried around was one camera with one lens. I might end up using my tiny little <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BH3XXQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B002BH3XXQ">Domke FX5</a> for one additional lens, some extra film, and thats it for future endeavors using a more casual approach. I still think I will never be attuned to events as photographic raw material - I am far better focusing on ONE subject rather than dozens. I find it too confusing but I do thing some melding of my tendency towards a more focused approach from a subject standpoint along with a more casual working method may produce the results I am after.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have received a couple of emails from new-ish Nikon users that had some questions about using older lenses. Here is RB&#8217;s quick and dirty guide to using older lenses on newer cameras. Beware this is focused more towards the pro end of the camera spectrum rather than the inexpensive new Nikon DSLR&#8217;s that only accept G type lenses without an Aperture ring. Assuming that your camera can mount lenses other than the brand new G lenses there is one key difference that you need to be aware of. This is an AI type lens vs a Non-AI type lens.</p>

<p>So, what&#8217;s this AI/Non-AI thing all about anyway???</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/P1010898.jpg"></p>

<p>Take a look at the ring right behind the lens mount/body cap. See the little finger or prong sticking up?  This is the AI prong. This one happens to be flipped up and out of the way so that you can mount a &#8220;Non-AI&#8221; old lens on the body. When flipped down it&#8217;s for mounting AI lenses and serves tells the in-camera meter what Aperture the lens is set to. When flipped down it&#8217;s in the way so you cannot mount a Non-AI lens. See the small silver button to the right of the finger/lever/prong - press it down to flip up the prong. If your camera has an AI ring that looks like this it can pretty much mount any lens. Too bad all digital bodies that have an AI ring/prong at all cannot flip them out of the way so you <a href="http://www.aiconversions.com/compatibilitytable.htm">MUST get your lens converted to AI - this guy does it for like 20 bucks or something cheap.</a></p>

<p>Moving on to lenses, If your lens looks like this - even the all black ones - it is a Non-AI lens unless it&#8217;s already been converted.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/P1010902.jpg"></p>

<p>Here is what the Aperture ring looks like - it&#8217;s a solid piece that extends all the way back.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/P1010903.jpg"></p>

<p>If you have a lens that looks like the next image&#8230;</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/P1010907.jpg"></p>

<p>or this&#8230;</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/P1010912.jpg"></p>

<p>It could be either an AI or a Non-AI&#8230;. The difference is the Aperture ring. You have already seen the way a Non-AI looks. This is what an AI lens&#8217; Aperture ring looks like&#8230;</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/P1010918.jpg"></p>

<p>The little second set of aperture numbers are a dead giveaway but more important is the cutout and the ridge that engages the AI prong on the camera body. AF lenses have these as well except for the newer G type lenses that have NO aperture ring.</p>

<p>As a note - if you are using a film body that has a flip up AI prong as shown above you have to use &#8220;stop down metering&#8221; This means that you have to press the DOF lever on the camera to stop the lens down to the aperture that it is set to so that you can adjust your shutter speed correctly as the camera will have no idea what aperture the lens is set to without the AI prong engaged that biases the meter to the &#8220;taking aperture&#8221; as the aperture ring is turned.</p>

<p>If anyone is interested how Non-AI metering with a Non-AI body works let me know. If not I&#8217;ll skip it. I am the only one that I know still using a camera with Non-AI style meter (An F2 with DP-1 meter finder).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The mailman came today and it was like christmas. I love this stuff, all for $100 from an eBay auction. If you want to learn a lot about photography, be capable of making extremely good looking images once you do, and you have very very little money this kind of thing is the ticket. Look what $100 buys you&#8230;</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/P10108961.jpg"></p>

<p>I won&#8217;t give the complete list but here are some highlights to give you an idea&#8230;</p>

<ul>
    <li>An almost mint condition Nikon FE in black paint - yep that&#8217;s black paint over enamel - The kind of thing that makes Leica users go temporarily insane and spend $8000 on a very similar device to shoot film with no included lenses.</li>
    <li>A pristine Nikkor 50mm f 1.8 AI lens - yea they are cheap on eBay but they are also very very good at taking nice images.</li>
    <li>A mint condition Nikkor 28mm Non-AI in the all metal variety. Yes it&#8217;s single coated vs NIC but I can tell you from my own experience it works great - in a lot of ways better than the larger aperture lenses and this one is not only perfect but it came with the Nikon supplied case. Yes it works on the FE - almost every lens ever made by Nikon does.</li>
    <li>A good condition Vivitar 85-205mm f 3.5 lens that probably takes pictures that are perfectly fine and feels about twice as good as the plastic crap like this made today.</li>
    <li>A mint condition Tamron SP 90mm f 2.8 macro that has a 9 bladed aperture and probably works great. 90mm f2.8 is a well know quantity virtually all of them are good - this one also happens to focus really really really close. It came with the original box and Tamron case. It&#8217;s AI so easy to work with.</li>
    <li>A flash gun that is not pictured. The manual for the FE, a dozen or so filters all in perfect shape like they have never been used. Some of them very expensive like the Tiffen polarizer, the Nikon ND, a set of Close-up lenses in perfect shape, a teleconverter, and a bunch of other paraphernalia.</li>
</ul>


<p>Heck even if you have loads of cash this is a great way to step out of your norm and make some very different images that you are making with your ultra-zo0m, AF, motor-driven, crop sensored, digi-cam. Everyone talks about how &#8220;The camera doesn&#8217;t matter&#8221;. I am here to tell you that is absolute bullshit. What <em>everyone</em> means is that every camera can take good images as well as bad images but different cameras with different sensor/film sizes with different handling characteristics, focus mechanisms, wind vs. motor, zoom vs fixed focal length, etc, etc, etc will make very different images in the hands of a <em>single photographer</em>. Heck they even influence the subject you point them at very differently.</p>
