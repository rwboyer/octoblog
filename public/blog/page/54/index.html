Both of the applications give you the ability to take a combination of adjustments and apply them to one or more images quickly and efficiently but they do it in different ways. I will give you my best objective view of how both applications work and you decide weather this is an important distinction for you or not. The reason that I say the subject is a thorny one to tackle is that if you get a couple of Aperture users and a couple of Lightroom users in a room together this is the one thing that both groups will never ever see eye to eye on.</div>

One of the great things about Aperture is it&#8217;s flexibility, also a liability when learning how to use it effectively and efficiently. Aperture&#8217;s do anything, anywhere, anytime philosophy can also allow you to make a big mess real quick. Here is the front end of my work-flow for every single thing I shoot. The back end is a whole lot different.</p>

File this one under the &#8220;No Crap, Who Doesn&#8217;t Know that..&#8221; file if you already know this but I was surprised that I got a few emails asking what I was talking about when I mentioned creating custom file naming conventions and how that can be used to save time when using custom images sequences that I discussed in the last Aperture Quick Tip. So here it is&#8230; When exporting image versions from Aperture if you take a look at the dialog that pops up you will see a drop down menu tiled &#8220;Name Format&#8221; as one of the dialog options. </div>

I mention in the PDF Aperture Organization Guide that it&#8217;s easy to use any order that you want for images in the browser, not just the preset orders provided in the drop down list but literally any order that you want. If you have ever used the sort order drop down in the upper left corner of the image browser you may have noticed that at the very bottom there is the &#8220;custom&#8221; option that is grayed out. </div>

Not just any workshop, I had this thing in my head that I was going to take a workshop that had nothing to do with commercial photography. After looking through the Woodstock Photographic workshop catalog I settled on one. Unfortunately I had no idea they were impossible to get into if you didn&#8217;t sign up and get accepted within the first week that enrollment opened up, March or something like that. Cutting to the chase, I being the determined tenacious being that I am, got the catalog for the next workshop season - sent my project prints in - and got one of the 10 spots in Keith Carter&#8217;s workshop. Now this was a foreign land for me. I had a great time even though I was apprehensive and felt like the odd ball in a group of artsy fartsies. I learned a lot - nothing that I expected to learn which made it even more enlightening. If I could do it over I would not have held back and been so conservative with the project that I took with me, more on that some other time. One of the things that was introduced in the workshop that I really didn&#8217;t pay much attention to, sort of a yea yea yea, I get it, let&#8217;s move on kind of thing was Keith mentioning numerous times how he is inspired by work in other completely different genres. He was not talking about landscape versus portraits. He was talking about genres not photographic, in fact not even graphic. His thing was poetry.</p>

Stacks are a way of grouping similar images together. The images can be various versions of the same image taken in the camera, virtual copies (as termed in LR), versions (same thing but Aperture term), or versions that were modified with an external editor/plug-in. Stacks have the same basic functionality in both applications and can more or less do similar jobs. The magic of stacks comes from their interaction with albums (Aperture) or collections (Lightroom). I will touch a little bit on albums/collections just because the function of images stacks are so closely related to these other features. I will also compare a bit of compare mode functionality as well mostly due to Apertures excellent &#8220;stack mode&#8221;.</div>

Both of these applications are so rich in both functionality and the multitude of ways they can used to support a photographic work-flow it will take a serious of articles to even scratch the surface. So, no better place to start than the image file management capabilities. Most photographers adopting either one of these applications will not delve into this subject until way down the road and when they do they usually have about 1,000 questions that they NEED answers to right now.</p>

<p>Aperture gives you two different ways to manage your original &#8220;master&#8221; image files. The first way is the managed masters method. Using managed masters Aperture pretty much completely insulates you from having to manage your images files at all. Aperture imports the images into its Library and figures out where to put them for you. This is great for libraries that are not of a massive scale, like on your laptop. </div>

Just a couple of thoughts while doing some testing of the site prior to moving the permanent domain name. I clearly remember the day I got one of those pretty email adverts from Apple announcing the launch of Aperture. I was sitting at my desk slogging though about 1200 images that I had shot that day doing the usual torturous routine of bringing up the RAW images in whatever application was the least of all evils in terms of making comparisons and evaluations trying to sort out what I actually wanted to use. Copying them to another folder to convert them into another format. Then copying them to another folder to do some color work. Then copying them to another folder to do some PS work. Then&#8230;. Maybe you know the cumbersome routine or maybe are still doing things that way.
Desperately looking for any distraction away from the tedium, I snapped to attention when the familiar sound of mail.app indicated what must be an urgent matter to attend to in my email. Thank god, an excuse to take a break from this. There in the inbox was the screen shot of Aperture. I actually read the message and clicked the link. </div>
