  <div class="entry-content"><p>Remember a week ago when I was deliberating on small, light, high quality equipment to choose for some upcoming &#8220;real&#8221; photographic projects that I have planned? I think my initial thoughts might prove to be the answer. At least for me. I want high quality color, high quality B+W, and a very very small digital option that will all fit in my Domke F-809 bag. If you do not remember - here it is - two Leica M bodies (film bodies that I already own) a couple of Leica lenses (most I already own - probably) and a micr0 4/3 digital chucked in for good measure.</p>

<p>Phase one paranoid testing is over. I have been using my Leica M for black and white film work continuously for the last year. Now how about 35mm color? As an acid test I shot some 9 year old Kodak Portra 160 VC film that I found laying around. I decided to really test this by looking up my nearest drug store for the cheapest process and scan, I shot a roll inside of an hour, paid my six bucks, and guess what - It worked. With some real film I will be more than satisfied to shoot film for the &#8220;real&#8221; stuff and hopefully satisfied with an Olympus E-PL1 for quick and dirty digital shots for web things. More on the E-PL1 soon.</p>

<p>Jumping to the matter at hand. These images are not the best photographs ever shot by me - or anyone for that matter. What they are are drug store quick and dirty with patented Shitty-Scan™ 8bit low res drug store scans. Untouched by me - just a resize. I think I will be fine with film - even under non-optimal circumstances. This was a quick test under horrible conditions - 9 year old film, my out of practice rangefinder technique, bad lighting, shallow depth of field, slow shutter speed (1/30 and 1/15) in most cases seen here. All shot with my 50mm Summicron.</p>

<p>I can live with this as a worst case. Could you? I do not need to blow these up to see that focus is fine, color is fantastic, tonal gradation is better than good, skin looks great, etc, etc. Hooo-freaking way I get to shed what feels like 5 tons of DSLR gear and paraphernalia and still get the &#8220;look&#8221; I want. Want intense color and contrast - shoot different film. As film ages the color goes, the contrast gets low, the grain goes up - and ugly, and the speed goes down. I shot this at ISO 100.</p>

<p>Now what lenses do I really really need that I may not have. Hey I love gear too - I just saved $6000 on not needing an M9.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For all of you that emailed me with concern, for either my site or my wellbeing - thank you. Except for small bursts of rage I am fine. As you probably know the site has been down since freaking FRIDAY!!!, that&#8217;s like a year in internet time. I guess that is what you get when you try to support the small local guy as hosting/ISP.</p>

<p>As of today the site has been moved to where I host some things for other clients/customers of mine. It should work fine now, and forever more. I hope.</p>

<p>Thank you for your patience, now back to our regular programing. I have about 4 posts ready to go up. If I catch up on everything else you should see them today - or at least this week.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the features introduced with Aperture 3 that I pretty much ignored was flags and labels. I ignored them because I&#8217;ve been there and done that with a pile of other software since the beginning of time. Not that there is anything inherently bad or wrong with these two devices, it&#8217;s just that I developed better ways of doing things since I started using Aperture - way way back in ancient times. By and large I &#8220;flag&#8221; and &#8220;label&#8221; things in my work-flow by grouping them together in albums that represent anything I want them to represent depending on the project - and I name the album appropriately.</p>

<p>I still think for a lot of things that albums are a better way of organizing your work-flow than flags and labels. At least they are in my work-flow. I have been living without them for years and never really looked back. So when Aperture 3 came along introducing flags and labels I took an attitude that they were included for all the &#8220;old fashioned dunderheads&#8221; that couldn&#8217;t wrap their heads around a new and better way of keeping track of what they were doing. In other words a concession made by the Apple guys to those coming from other software that happened to have them - at least until those new users &#8220;got it&#8221;.</p>

<p>Well after living with Aperture 3 for months and months I was determined to figure out how to integrate flags and labels into my new way of doing business in some meaningful way. A lot of my work-flows have some similarities across projects but that is where it ends - I have no absolute fixed way of going about things and my projects are diverse enough where color labels HAD to mean different things for different projects way back when that was what I used. On top of that flags are only good for &#8220;state change&#8221; type of things - in other words images that are either in one state or in another - not in two or more states of being. Flags to me have never been more than a really really simple bookmark that has meaning for one particular session - never some global meaningfulness.</p>

<p>So while I still believe albums are a better way of going about organizing your photographic life for the most part - I have integrated labels and flags back into my toolbox in Aperture 3. I won&#8217;t go into a specific prescription as I don&#8217;t believe that is all that valuable - everyones needs and way of doing business is different enough to invalidate a lot of specifics. If it&#8217;s not and your organization already has a label prescription - you know what it is and you are set. Instead I will give you an overview of my findings with some general advice if you are still thinking about where labels and flags fit into your overall photographic life.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s start with color labels. For the way I work and I would imagine everyone else out there - for labels to be useful at all they absolutely must have a global meaning of one and only one thing across all projects - if they don&#8217;t the mental gymnastics of trying to figure out what they did mean for one project or another or one image or another is worse than not using them at all. If you do have things in your photographic life where you need a quick visual reference of a few particular things across all of your projects and images color labels can be very effective - the least of which is in the context of an active project. Where they really shine is in more global searches of your library where there is no project or album context. Personally I don&#8217;t use them to reflect things I already know from other metadata activities like ratings, keywords, etc. I definitely do not use them to reflect on things like &#8220;done-ness&#8221; or &#8220;selects&#8221; I find that redundant and to honest counter productive.</p>

<p>Moving on to flags - I still find these the most useful to temporarily mean whatever I need them to mean in the context of whatever I am doing right now, not some global static one meaningfulness for all time - that is what I use color labels for. For example - if I do a quick search in a project or a folder of projects for some broad category of thing I want to see and then need to mark a few specific images while viewing that search and retain the ability to quickly see just those images when in another context. When looking at a smart album I will flag a few images and jump to the containing project for an image and do a search just on flagged images. Things like that.</p>

<p>My really big complaint is that Aperture 3 doesn&#8217;t embed flags and color labels in IPTC as other apps do. If it did color labels would be a very effective tool for cross application work-flow. What do you guys use flags and labels for?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/2001-033-05-880.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2101" title="2001-033-05-880" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/2001-033-05-880-300x136.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="136" /></a>I have been following a recent series of PDN articles on &#8220;experts&#8221; giving opinions to photographers on what images they should use to enter various markets. You may remember my somewhat jaded comments last time regarding the photojournalist entering the commercial / art market. I really wonder how many are reading this series for the same reasons I do. I am sure that some people are but my inquisitive nature causes me to really really want to know what the readership split is. For simplicities sake let&#8217;s cut the audience into two broad categories - those that find the contradictions between the &#8220;experts&#8221; amusing and the idiotically motherhood and apple pie &#8220;advice&#8221; so non-specific and non-actionable it is worth a giggle or two - and the other category of those hanging on every word of opinion and advice so that they can get the magic secret and apply it immediately to their work, portfolio whatever.</p>

<p>Yesterday&#8217;s installment was particularly amusing to me for really strange reasons but I had to share the subtle irony that gave me such a giggle with all of you. Yes I know I am strange but hey, aren&#8217;t we all. So&#8230; Here are a couple that shoot weddings together and they want some advice on targeting the &#8220;high-end&#8221; wedding market. Yep - that situation is so highly unique hmmmm&#8230; shoot 3,987,987 weddings a year for $1.49 each or&#8230; 4 weddings a year at $100,000 a pop. Is there a wedding photographer alive that wants to do something more toward the latter? For all of you non-english speakers that exaggeration is a hyperbole but illustrates the ultimate universal answer when ANY wedding photographer is asked about developing their business - same or less weddings, higher end client, more money per event. duhhhh.</p>

<p>On to the amusing part - the experts. One of those wedding magazine people from the 5 different conde-nast wedding magazines and&#8230; Kevin Kubota. You know Kubota, don&#8217;t you. He is like the Gary Fong of Photoshop actions for wedding photographers. In other words he has made his name synonymous with Photoshop stuff you must have to be a wedding photographer. You know the stuff that gives wedding photographers their own &#8220;style&#8221; - he has like 997 different action packs with 342 different effects each. In other words enough that you can pick effect #283 from pack #23 and effect number 118 form pack #765 and you will not look like the other guys. Wow - cool.</p>

<p>I know I am biased here in my prognostication that a lot of today&#8217;s wedding photographic treatments will be the polyester leisure suite of the next decade but the really really funny irony is that the wedding magazine guy gives a piece of advice to the would be high-end wedding shooters that high-end clientele are &#8220;less interested in post production&#8221;. Now she had to say that for a reason - most likely they are current Kubota customers - or something like that, but that piece of advice did not come out of left field to people that are shooting film producing a portfolio that looks strait out of the camera is it?</p>

<p>Oh come on you have to see the humor - don&#8217;t you? The wedding magazine person couches a too much Photoshop action criticism  - she even used the term &#8220;Photoshop action&#8221;  when she is part of the two person team giving advice with &#8220;Mr. Photoshop actions for wedding photographers&#8221;. That is freaking hilarious - I wonder if she was like - &#8220;oooooooooooops&#8221; once that escaped into the air? Wouldn&#8217;t you love to be part of the crowd hanging with her at the bar that night?</p>

<p>&#8220;So I was with Kevin Kubota today for a portfolio critique and I said&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;YOU SAID WHAT??&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea I know. As soon as it came out, I was like, ummm, aaaah, what I mean is..&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yea - you all know I still love film and am thinking of making it my primary medium for some up coming &#8220;real&#8221; work that I am planning on that is a little further from my front door. You also know that I highlight some other &#8220;crazy fools&#8221; that still shoot the stuff. The thing that surprised me is how many people still shoot film and love using their film gear in the land spews digital photo products 24x7.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, long time readers might remember that I really haven&#8217;t shot seriously in about 2 years or so. I really needed to take a long break. I had over done my chosen subject and vocation. So much so that I really didn&#8217;t even feel like picking up a camera again. Not a good place to be given I love photography. That was a stupid thing to do - not shooting for a couple of years.</p>

<p>I can say that now because having spent time away from the camera in any serious way, not having a &#8220;job&#8221; that I had to shoot, and quite literally never ever shooting anything more than a few steps from my house. I do understand a lot more about the subject matter I want to point my camera at and more importantly - HOW i want to approach those subjects. When I say that was a stupid thing to do it is only in the hindsight of not shooting anything relevant that I have that feeling, now that I again really really want to.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t even own the gear that felt like it was welded to my hands during the period of time that got me into that funk. I sold it because it was still worth a lot of cash at that time and I really never wanted to see it again. It was that bad. I still have way too much gear - a hodgepodge of stuff that make not a lot of sense when you lay it all out. A couple of digital Nikon bodies. A smattering of Nikon glass -  a lot of it good to great but not state of the art. A bunch of old film bodies - Nikon, Leica, Hasselblad, Rollei, Large format.</p>

<p>Last week I was sort of forced to a couple of decisions - for planning purposes. The first factor was my growing desire to really start shooting again on a laundry list of projects that I have been developing and reordering. The second was an opportunity to do something way way different - live on a sailboat either this winter or next sailing around the tropics. Don&#8217;t worry - I will still be on the grid to post here and do my Aperture stuff, and my one on one stuff. The important thing is that those to influences caused me to seriously assess my goals, equipment, and approach to my photography that I have been putting off for a long time.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/199000301.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1992" title="199000301" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/199000301-300x194.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="194" /></a></p>

<p>After thinking long and hard about it - I do need one new piece of digital equipment and possibly one new lens. I decided based on a lot of factors my main camera would be my Leica rangefinders and a small contingent of 35, 50, 90 focal length lenses. These are not M9&#8217;s nor do I plan on getting an M9 unless the prices drop significantly. I have no real need for fast turn around and I really really like the look of film better. Black and White, super saturated slide film, and creamy subtle color negative - they all have a unique and in most cases fantastic look to them. 90% of the images I choose to live with on a day to day basis were shot on film.</p>

<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t like digital - I love digital output and reach. Every once in a while I even need that instant turnaround. So I also need a digital capture device. It will not be a DSLR with a couple of zoom lenses. I need a new digital camera to complement my Leica M cameras - something reasonable in price, decent image quality, and of a size that I will not even notice in my Leica kit. The whole kit fits in a Domke F-803 and is smaller than one Nikon pro body and one large aperture zoom. I am leaning toward the Olympus E-PL1. The first one was too expensive - the E-P2 is also too expensive the E-PL1 is just right - price wise Yes I know I cast disparaging remarks on the original E-P1 but a lot of my complaints have been rectified - they have auxiliary viewfinders - optical and electronic now, price is more reasonable, etc.</p>

<p>As for the new lens I &#8220;need&#8221;. I could probably get away with my kit but&#8230; I do want to do some low light and I LOVE the 50 Noctilux so I might &#8220;need&#8221; a really really fast 50 for my Leica M cameras. So there you have it, the really funny thing is even without the sailboat space restrictions I got thinking about it and my choices would be the same for ANY of the subject matter that has got me itching to to some real photographic work.  The recipe for me is compact, superlative lenses, film and really compact reasonable quality, low priced digital.</p>

<p>Am I nuts? Maybe but I think it is a very rational set of choices for what I want to shoot, how I want to shoot it, and very importantly how I want the results to look. Yes my D3 can do somethings better but not everything. My D3 will look good by many many measurements but it will not look like film and that is what I want for my projects.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. You think I am the only one thinking like this lately? I really do not think so. If you shoot normal sized things from normal distances this might be the ticket for you as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some clarifications from my last post regarding my choices, why they are right for me, and my subject matter. 80% of my pictures are rendered as 8x10 or smaller usually in books of some sort either digital or books I make from prints that I do myself. The other 19% are in prints that are approximately 11x14 in size maybe longer if I do full frame and the last 1% are bigger than that - usually for temporary exhibition purposes where people are not right on top of them. I love the way all of my film performs at 11x14 - even TX and TMZ from 35mm. It looks great. If the image is good the final output is good.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t shoot Macro, I don&#8217;t shoot action from far away, I don&#8217;t shoot birds, I rarely use a focal length beyond 90mm on 35mm or equivalent on any format. I shoot close - or at &#8220;normal distances&#8221; of &#8220;normal sized things&#8221;. I can shoot all day every day with a 50 - occasionally a 35mm or maybe a 90. The &#8220;action&#8221; I care about is only a few feet away at best and based on long long experience shooting moving things with a 35-50 at 3 to 5 feet away AF and rapid frame rates are no better than manual focus and good timing - in many many cases they are actually more effective at getting the shot - the good shot. Don&#8217;t believe me - put some work into it to the point where you are not totally incompetent at pulling the trigger and focusing and try both.</p>

<p>Autofocus, no matter what situation sucks at close distance where the apparent rate of change across the frame and back and forth are magnified by about 1000 compared to 25 yards away with a tele. I will go further to say they are a distraction of what is really effective - smooth, predictive focus and shoot based on what is about to happen. Heck even if the thing is not moving at all AF is useless at close distance and usually interferes with your compositional thought process.</p>

<p>Film looks good - I think most people forgot how good it looks. Does it look like digital - no. Especially at &#8220;100%&#8221; actually it looks horrible at things approaching 40x magnification. So the f%#k what - it looks fantastic at normal size. The color and gradation are incomparable within it&#8217;s &#8220;region of fit&#8221;. Just like my Zeiss lenses look fantastic even if their &#8220;specs&#8221; are a joke compared to a Nikon 24 PC. They have a rendering that is fantastic. This is what I care about overall. I really do not care what the underlying medium looks like at the ultimate magnification. Digital once &#8220;noise&#8221; is removed and zoomed in to actual capture pixels looks like &#8230; well&#8230; nothing. Why? Because it is nothing there is no medium to speak of. Now make something physical out of it - like a print on a typical piece of &#8220;satin&#8221; photo paper on inkjet and take a look at that under a high magnification - it looks absolutely awful - so what. The point is to judge the print and output you actually make on it&#8217;s own merits not at artificial arbitrary &#8220;tests&#8221;.</p>

<p>That is what is important to me. If other things are important to you make your own call.</p>

<p>There is one thing that has me worried - color film. I am a color nut when I choose to do color. I don&#8217;t mean nutty wild color - I mean I want a certain look with very very subtle gradation and certain colors rendered certain ways. If I don&#8217;t get it, it&#8217;s trash. So I do worry about buying bulk color film stock and having it processed in a variety of labs so I am going to do a test, well maybe I will. Something I have never done before to see if worst case color is still okay. I am going to shoot a roll of 8 year old Kodak Portra 160VC, stored in suboptimal conditions, and processed at the closest drug store. Yep worst case, and see what happens. I will let you know how it goes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are only a few of them up but they are highly addictive - my favorite by far is Sessions or maybe it is Exposer. What you haven&#8217;t downloaded the Safari update and haven&#8217;t played with the Safari Extension Gallery yet? Holy crap, it&#8217;s been out all day. Do it now and definitely check out Sessions - an amazingly slick way to save and retrieve an any combination of safari windows/tabs you want - I have like 24 different safari sessions saved that I flip back and forth already. Gallery - that to - sort of like a mini expose just for safari tabs inside of one browser window. You might want ultimate status bar to go along with that. Oh and EXIF data&#8230;</p>

<p>Sorry got carried away - just do it, load up some extensions and see what you think. Seriously these things are slick - I guess the one thing that I was missing being a Safari user was extensions - I cannot wait to see more. These are really slick - and unlike FireFox they all seem slick and high quality.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8216;Member we had that photojournalism, class 1, 2, and 3 wordy discussion the other day. Well <a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/pdn/content_display/photo-news/photojournalism/e3i7deb554f2e0e8b2f97259de6564a8b39">this is completely tangential but I found it interesting</a>. &#8220;Expert buyers&#8221; give advice to a PJ type photographer that wants to repackage what he does and has shot for &#8220;commercial&#8221; buyers. You may find it interesting.</p>

<p>Here are a couple of observations:</p>

<ol>
    <li>DSLR PJ guy is switching to medium format film - sorry had to point that out.</li>
    <li>One &#8220;expert&#8221; took the goal the same as I did - sell images that he &#8220;wants&#8221; to make and does/has made for &#8220;his&#8221; projects to commercial buyers. The other &#8220;expert&#8221; interpreted it completely differently as wanting to sell his style to commercial buyers assuming he is now changing careers and will be shooting sets/models/etc - commercial shoots - NOT his projects but his clients projects and gives advise on how he should shoot some &#8220;commercial work&#8221; by recreating the mood of the work he actually does using the same methods she assumes he will be doing it in the future - hmmmm. Either she missed his goal or she did not but was giving him the reality of &#8220;sorry buddy - nice work but you are actually going to have to shoot work specifically for commercial clients - they can buy stuff like this all day from stock if that is what they actually used&#8230;&#8221; Time for shooting class 3 work&#8230;</li>
    <li>I guess he can&#8217;t find any grants/NGO&#8217;s this year - ooooops. the hazards of wanting to shoot class 1 or class 2 work. You do know that is how &#8220;pro&#8221; photographers shoot the stuff they want don&#8217;t you? On the dole, unless of course you are S.S.</li>
</ol>


<p>I also urge you not to take the &#8220;experts&#8221; words as gospel - they are notoriously absolutely wrong. How do I know this&#8230;?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I put up a long post yesterday that does a half baked job at summarizing a conversation had with one photographer - and similar conversations with dozens of them. Usually while drinking. Just so you don&#8217;t think I am all work and no play - or too too serious, I thought I would summarize another conversation as well, this one is short.</p>

<p>A long time reader emailed me that stumbled across <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2505674">this aperture forum dialo</a>g - he thanked me for providing him with a good laugh, the only one he had all week (bad week).</p>

<p>What about the limitations part and the creativity part you ask? Well just so you don&#8217;t get me wrong - I am all for creativity, experimentation, and happy accidents. They are wonderful tools for discovery, just not in the context of a &#8220;technical&#8221; question. Why do you think I still shoot a lot of film - sometimes slow film. How about manual focus. A lot of mistakes give me great ideas - just as they have given countless photographers great ideas in the past. Limitations in a lot of cases breeds real creativity.</p>

<p>How do you think all of you landscape guys started to shoot water at slow speeds? Most likely it was not part of the plan - it is now but not the first guy. He probably couldn&#8217;t manage the shutter speed he really really wanted - most likely he would have dialed it up to ISO 400 or maybe his auto-iso settings would have for him. Strange DOF and focus point choices that turn out great - again most likely an accident of not having &#8220;enough&#8221; light and not having enough time to think it through to much - ohhh and not having auto focus that was really smart. Just some thoughts on limitations and how you might not want to always &#8220;overcome&#8221; them.</p>
