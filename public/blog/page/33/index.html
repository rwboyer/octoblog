  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/ApAdjust.jpg"><img title="ApAdjust.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/.thumbs/.ApAdjust.jpg" border="0" alt="ApAdjust.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="94" align="left" /></a>One of the things that I have always liked about Aperture adjustments is how useful the normal range of the sliders are. The entire range is very finely tuned and quite useful. It reminds me a whole lot of the BMW&#8217;s that I have owned. The steering, accelerator, and brakes have a finely tuned range. You want subtle? You Got it. More Power - more gas. Unlike some other cars I have driven where the useful range is the first 2mm of travel, or so it feels. Sort of like some other software.</p>

<p>One of the things that I use automatically are the modifier keys when it is appropriate. I forget to explicitly mention them in concert with the adjustment tools until someone reminds me. Like a in a One On One Aperture help session I was having the other day. Since it is fresh in my mind I thought I would introduce you or at least remind you about the adjustment controls and some tricks they have when used with the command, option, and shift.</p>

<p>First off a lot of the adjustment controls do not dead end where the slider stops. They go beyond the slider range either by typing in a number or holding down the left mouse button and dragging over the number. Try them yourself if you need more range out of an adjustment in a special circumstance. Here is a partial list.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Exposure</li>
    <li>Brightness</li>
    <li>The color controls - specifically hue, luminance, and range</li>
    <li>Vignette - amount</li>
    <li>White balance</li>
    <li>Contrast</li>
    <li>Saturation</li>
    <li>Noise reduction - yep even this one.</li>
</ul>


<p>With most of the sliders and when dragging over the number value for that adjustment the shift and option modifier keys speed up or slow down how fast the adjustment changes. These are really useful for both cranking things through the roof with shift or very fine tuning with option.</p>

<p>The command key will show you &#8220;blown&#8221; channels via a color coded display if you hold it down while dragging certain controls - it can really help. It is probably most useful with exposure and recovery. Try it - see if for yourself. If you forgot about these make it a point to use some of the adjustment &#8220;extras&#8221; that are useful to you for everything to special effects with the vignette and noise reduction to extremely fine control with the color sliders and option drag.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Booktool.jpg"><img title="Booktool.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/.thumbs/.Booktool.jpg" border="0" alt="Booktool.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="94" align="left" /></a>Well it took a while but it&#8217;s here. A new Aperture eBook. This one covers the Aperture book tool. If you have been following my posts you probably know how much I love making things with photos and how great I think the Aperture book tool is.</p>

<p>There is far more to the book tool that just Apple provided themes and Apple printed books. The book tool is really a tool to print any thing you want. Even if you don&#8217;t print things it can do all kinds of stuff to combine images and text. Well enough on about the Aperture book tool and a little more about the eBook.</p>

<p>This is a strange eBook. It is in the normal vein of my other eBooks as in it is conceptual with concrete examples more than it is a regurgitation of the Aperture manual. I rewrote this one twice. I hope I got the balance right between explaining the tools and providing simple examples to reinforce the concepts. My last version was too heavy on design topics that clouds the issue so I got rid of that and use examples that don&#8217;t focus on design at all. My first version was way too technical explaining all kinds of things nobody but me will every give a crap about. This one I hope is a good balance and more what I had in mind when I started.</p>

<p>I think it is good for people that have never used the book tool as well as those that have but have a lot of questions about it as well. The one thing I do not do is explain things like what a text box is or what a picture box is - those things are self evident and make the conceptual part too hard to get through. Even with leaving out complicated design, and explanations of each and every individual tool it ended up being longer than I expected - about 12,000 words.</p>

<p>Even though I provide a few step by step examples to reinforce the topics discussed, I included some bonus content as well. A couple of screencasts that walk through the first few examples and one of the Automator workflows that I discuss, just so you don&#8217;t have to use Automator itself if you don&#8217;t want to.</p>

<p>Take a look <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/aperture-ebooks/">Aperture eBooks</a>.</p>

<p>Enjoy</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, if your finely tuned senses can take my harsh treatment of digital YouTube media in their somehow lousier quality than my original 720p version, here is take two of that short screencast that I asked your opinion on a few days ago.</p>

<p>I kept the pacing about the same as last time but monkeyed with the video settings and window size to better match to YouTube 720p. As all of you suggested I added some voice to go along with it. The sound is really crappy and distorted. I have a bunch of really decent microphones but&#8230;</p>

<p>I somehow misplaced my Apogee Firewire audio mixer in the shuffle of my chaotic life. I will find it soon, I hope, that thing is awesome. If you ever need a compact hight quality audio mixer check out the Duet. This time I just used my MacBook Pro&#8217;s built in microphone and got rid of the noise - unfortunately that required boosting the voice frequencies up way too high - hence the distortion.</p>

<p>Let me know if you can tell what is going on, pacing, etc.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A friend gave me a new magic mouse around Christmas. I just wanted to say that after a month or so this thing has to be one of the best Apple toys ever. I am sure that I would have bought one myself - eventually. Actually I am sure I would have bought a new Mac that came with one in the box. I am not likely to buy a mouse for 70 bucks just because I am bored but I have to tell you guys, if you don&#8217;t have one - you need one.</p>

<p>First off - no more dirty track ball that stops functioning. Secondly this thing is actually a very beautiful piece of sculpture. It has to be one of the best looking objects ever - even if it just sat there like a paperweight. Third - you never knew how much time you wasted with scrolling things until you do not have to waste that time anymore. I swear the magic mouse will make you more productive. Even in Aperture.</p>

<p>It is sort of like when Apple enabled two finger scrolling on their mouse pads only better. I don&#8217;t know about you but after two finger scrolling on my MacBook Pro I could  never go back to a regular track pad. Same thing with this mouse. I will never give up scrolling. Absolutely fantastic. If you need to scroll somewhere this is the way to go - really fast. For that matter really slow as well. It really is magic.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. Almost forgot - check out this software to make it even better - <a href="http://en.onsoftware.com/the-best-magic-mouse-software/">better touch tool</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/2001_031_28.jpg"><img title="2001_031_28.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/.thumbs/.2001_031_28.jpg" border="0" alt="2001_031_28.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="102" align="left" /></a>Remember way way back I was excited about the Leica M9. Well I was and I still am - sort of. If I have a need for something like a Leica but I must have digital output for some reason I will probably consider an M9. I am glad that it exists in the world. If I was a PJ and had to get images out right now I would definitely use one for a lot of my work. I am not so I decided that before I went and plunked down $8000 I would dust off my old M6 kit and shoot with it for a while to see what happened.</p>

<p>I have been toting the M6 and a lens or two around with me just about everywhere. I was even inspired to start a couple of longer term projects with it. I have shot only black and white so far and have used a mishmash of old 7 or 8 year old film I had laying around. Tri-X, TMAX3200 TMZ, etc. I have liked it so much that I actually put in a big film order for 35mm film last week. It cost me about $170 this will probably hold me off on &#8220;needing&#8221; an M9 for a long time.</p>

<p>The camera is great - having it with me is great - being &#8220;limited&#8221; to 35mm and 50mm is great. It is a freeing experience. I forgot what it is like to travel light. The film I have shot so far has it&#8217;s flaws. The biggest one is me but I am sure I will get back in shape in another month or two. The other flaws are that the TMZ is almost useless after 8 years. You have not seen fog like this. It&#8217;s bad. The Tri-X is useable but still fogged a bit. That is why I got new film. Point is it is cheap and it is fun and on top of that I get fantastic results - at least by my definition.</p>

<p>I also noticed that people are still voting on my Leica M9 poll. The results have cooled off a lot since the introduction. Far more people are not considering it as a purchase now. I wonder if the same demographic decided to make a future investment in something else or just decided they don&#8217;t really need a new camera? I hope it is the latter.</p>

<p>The image at the top was shot on my Leica M6 with a 35mm Summicron wide open or thereabouts. Really slow shutter speed - like 1/8th-ish, hand held in very very low light - very low backlight. A nightmare of an exposure situation when you need to shoot quickly. I kind of like the image  - it is interesting to me. Yea I know that everything is not in focus that is what happens when you shoot about wide open and close. Yea I know there is a little flare - that is what happens when you shoot into your light source in a big big way wide open. Yea I know there is subject motion. It is still interesting to me - I love the expressions on each of there faces - this was the moment when the wedding planner let the bride and her best friends know 5 minutes before the wedding was supposed to start that A) The flowers were not here and could not be located and B) The best man was not here with another one of the ushers and could not be located. Priceless and a great example of why you do not want me as your wedding photographer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have offered the <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/aperture-photography-one-on-one-assistance/">One On One service</a> for photographers and Aperture users for about a week now. So far so good. I have had the chance to meet a bunch of really nice people and give them a hand on topics ranging from beginning Aperture use to helping them solve some complex work-flow issues to helping them diagnose some interesting and bizarre issues that I have never seen before. All of the people that have signed up so far have expressed their wonderment at my apparent depth on the subject matter - heck I even recommended a retouch artist that I worked with in LA a while ago to someone for a new clothing line he is launching.</p>

<p>Getting to the point - I wanted to share something that I discovered while helping a photographer the specializes in children&#8217;s portraiture. She has owned Aperture for a little over two years but has never been able to get it to work. She bought a new Mac and still no luck. The problem was simple enough - the import wouldn&#8217;t  import. In fact it would not even display any images at all in the folders she was trying to import. No outlines - nothing. The files were there as you could see in the finder. Regular old JPEGs.</p>

<p>I worked on this for about 15 minutes and got Aperture to work except in one set of directories that happened to store all of her finished files. Aperture would navigate the folders just fine it just failed to display any images in that folder hierarchy. Vexing!</p>

<p>The answer - the top level folder name had a tilde in it as in &#8220;XXASDF ~ asdfasdfas&#8221;. This would never happen to me because it would never occur to me to name something with a tilde considering I am an old unix guy but she thought they looked &#8220;prettier&#8221; than a dash. Guess what happens if a tilde is in the file name? Aperture will not display any images in the import window for that folder or any other folder under it. Bizarre.</p>

<p>Just thought I would share this for all you Aperture users out there as an anecdote and something to look at when you are experiencing a vexing issue with Aperture or anything else. Don&#8217;t look at this as a literal answer - more as a philosophical example. Yea it is a strange way to name a folder but Aperture can navigate it. It doesn&#8217;t seem to cause any issues for anything else but&#8230; It is way different than &#8220;normal&#8221; and that thing that is different even if stupid could aggravate a bug or whatever you might want to call it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/ApertureScreenSnapz006.jpg"><img title="ApertureScreenSnapz006.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/.thumbs/.ApertureScreenSnapz006.jpg" border="0" alt="ApertureScreenSnapz006.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="92" align="left" /></a>One of the least used features of Aperture - The lowly old light table. It&#8217;s an album that lets you chuck a bunch of images up on a paste board and resize them relative to each other. Oh it does let you drag them around as well. That&#8217;s about it. I won&#8217;t go into explaining them as in how to use the couple of self evident controls they have available. That is easy enough to figure out on your own. What I will do is tell you a little bit about how I use them and share something a buddy of mine started using them for.</p>

<p>I come from way way back - I like prints. I like contact sheets and still make scads of them. One of the things that I used to do is &#8220;play&#8221; with a big pile of related prints for various jobs - sort of arranging them on the floor next to each other to see how they work &#8220;together&#8217;. Fact is I still do that. I also use the Aperture light table feature to do that as well.</p>

<p>My work-flow for most book projects starts with a light table. I chuck the images that I plan to use in a book up on a light table and I start to fiddle with image relationships. What images work together. How they are best juxtapositioned and sequenced. I also start to determine which will be the dominant images in the book by making them bigger. I only really use two sizes to do this - the size they start out as and about 4 times that size. I also sequence the images from left to right like a giant story board - like an ultra-wide panorama as the light table can grow in any direction. I stick pretty much from left to right. Using light tables to do this seems to me to be a much more free form layout activity than doing it in the context of a book. When I am actually putting the book together I am more focused on page layout and design. With the light table I am not worried about that right now - I am focused only on the images, relationships, and sequence without other issues crowding out my brain.</p>

<p>A good fried and excellent travel photographer started a new aspect of his business a few months ago. He sells prints from his vast body of beautiful work. More specifically he sells print installations. Whole walls of his prints. He started using the Aperture light table as a virtual wall to help clients visualize what prints will go on what walls with each other. He sits down with them and they play with various combinations and sizes to get a rough idea of how the installation will be put together before committing to a final design. This is a pretty obvious use but I thought it was a great idea and might be of use to some of you out there that could have a similar need.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/ApertureScreenSnapz005_1.jpg"><img title="ApertureScreenSnapz005_1.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/.thumbs/.ApertureScreenSnapz005_1.jpg" border="0" alt="ApertureScreenSnapz005_1.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="94" align="left" /></a>Until we see Aperture 3 I am going to try to get all you Aperture fans &#8220;ready&#8221; by trying to give you some useful stuff that you may not know or may not have thought about in the version that we all have right now. For some of you it might be a whole lot like getting a new version.</p>

<p>This is a quick one covering something obvious but there are a couple of little hints in here that even you experts might have missed. As you know I am a big fan of stack mode if you have been reading some of my other stuff. Stack mode helps me get to selects really fast. I use compare mode as well but to a much lesser extent and usually use it way down the road in my work-flow to compare very different images.</p>

<p>One of the things that we all need to do is compare similar images - not just overall composition but also images that are very similar compositions in a quick sequence to get to our selects. Aside from an overview we photographers compare detail - usually at 100% - sometimes for sharpness but mostly for subtleties.</p>

<p>The Aperture loupe tool is the worst way to do this. Really it is. The zoom tool (Z key) is the best way. Especially if you are in stack mode or compare mode. Both images get zoomed to 100% and you can drag them around with the space bar. Better yet you can drag them both around at the same time using Shift+Space. Using Z and Shift+Space to compare two images is about 900 times more productive than trying to go back and forth using the loupe.  Try it.</p>

<p>But wait there is more - zooming and shift space works on any number of images in a selection when you have more than one being displayed in the viewer. Yep it works with three or four or&#8230; I do this all the time and it is by far the fastest way to do things in a lot of cases. Esp if you are a shortcut key junkie like I am.</p>

<p>Hold on - we do have one more thing (as Steve would say). You hecklers out there may be saying to yourself - dragging images around zoomed in or using the loupe tool is so slow it sucks. Well you are sort of right but you are actually wrong. You are right if you do not have any idea how to do things effectively in Aperture - If you have a fantastic machine two images with a ton of performance killing adjustments layered on that you want to compare you should be fine. If you want to do it on not so great a machine with those same adjustments it will drag. If you have 4 images up and they have a tone of stuff going on even the biggest machine will be brought to it&#8217;s knees.</p>

<p>So what to do - well that&#8217;s easy instead of complaining over on the Aperture support forum of how bad Aperture sucks because it allows you to ask it to do a lot of work easily - just do it smarter. Even on the lowliest machine this works great. Before you start dragging the images around zoomed in just hit the &#8220;M key&#8221; to disable all the adjustments - drag - hit the M key again - bang no performance lag. Now if you use the menu for everything instead of shortcut keys this would be cumbersome. If you learn to use Aperture well it can be a joy in terms of responsiveness and work-flow productively. So&#8230;</p>

<ol>
    <li>Select images</li>
    <li>Z key</li>
    <li>M key</li>
    <li>Shift+Space drag them</li>
    <li>M key</li>
</ol>


<p>I swear I can be about 4 times as productive even on a 13inch last gen MacBook with Aperture, its shortcuts, and it&#8217;s UI options than I can with Lightroom. If you didn&#8217;t know this or have not thought about it before give it a try and be sure to get used to the shortcuts so they become automatic - I swear it will feel like you got a new machine and a new version of Aperture.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/kylie_bax_helmut_newton.jpg"><img title="kylie_bax_helmut_newton.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/.thumbs/.kylie_bax_helmut_newton.jpg" border="0" alt="kylie_bax_helmut_newton.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="149" height="150" align="left" /></a>One of my all time favorites. My work is heavily influenced by Helmut Newton. Like Salgado (which I admire but is not a giant influence in my own endeavors), when I think I am doing okay - I revisit some of Newtons vast archive of decades of photography. That sets me strait with how much further I have to grow and I get back to work again.</p>

<p>Helmut Newton is one of the few successful commercial photographers that blended his own vision for his art with a commercial commodity with no compromise. You either wanted Newton for your look or you didn&#8217;t. If all you see is fantastically sexy women and men in some gorgeous settings that anyone could shoot you are missing Helmut Newton in a big big way. This guy is fantastically unimaginably good.</p>

<p>Take an in depth look at his work. Again, a book is way better than just surfing the web for a<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/67_Helmut_Newton_TwoPairsOfLegsInBl.jpg"><img title="67_Helmut_Newton_TwoPairsOfLegsInBl.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/.thumbs/.67_Helmut_Newton_TwoPairsOfLegsInBl.jpg" border="0" alt="67_Helmut_Newton_TwoPairsOfLegsInBl.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="140" height="150" align="right" /></a>couple of his more well known images. They are good but they are not even close to being comprehensive or even representative of is vast body of personal, art, and commercial work. Buy a book or six, schedule yourself a few hours on the weekend with a nice bottle of wine and really take some time so see what is going on with this guy&#8217;s images. There is of course the initial wow but what makes this guy so so very good is the depth and complexity of his work with such seemingly simple compositions.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/helmut_newton_008_1975_409x604.jpg"><img title="helmut_newton_008_1975_409x604.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/.thumbs/.helmut_newton_008_1975_409x604.jpg" border="0" alt="helmut_newton_008_1975_409x604.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="102" height="150" align="left" /></a>I don&#8217;t think I have seen a Helmut Newton image that does not exude  lavishness, decadence, privvy, sexuality, and have at least a subtext of fetishistic polarities - pain, pleasure, want, desire, lust, love, tender, harsh. Amazing.</p>

<p>Holy crap his stuff has me sounding like a blabbering art critic or something. I probably own more Helmut Newton monographs than any other photographer. One of my heros.</p>

<p>Enjoy</p>
