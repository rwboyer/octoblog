  <div class="entry-content"><pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Actually, I'm okay, everyone I know, and everyone I have ever heard of is okay. Irene was a non-event here in Merry ole Maryland. Of course it was, however, I have been without power since Saturday night at 10pm. This is not at all unusual, my power goes out if it &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;/em&gt; like it's going to maybe be cloudy. The reason for this is I live at the end of a peninsula and the vintage 1950 power lines that service my small community run through 12 miles of state forest.&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<br/>


<p>I actually feel like I am more the victim of Delmarva power than the victim of Irene. The embarrassing thing about this is that all of the non-utility companies like Comcast and Verizon have three or four trucks working on the issue on the same pole intrastructure as the power lines use. Delmarva? Nowhere to be seen, it&#8217;s rediculous. </p>


<br/>


<p>In anycase, I will be posting some content more relevant to all of you as soon as the power is restored. Right now I am just sitting at a wireless hotspot so that I can check my email - probably a more important communication mechanism to me than my phone.</p>


<br/>


<p>Hope everyone else made it through as well as we did.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have about 300 requests for Aperture 3 presets that are camera specific for Aperture 3. I get these in my emails all the time. I have released a few free ones as well as put up a really crappy screencast explaining a general approach to emulating the Nikon out of camera look with picture controls using Aperture 3.</p>

<p>Here is the rub - although I generally think education is the best route and that commercial presets are not people are clamoring for presets that do this. The freebies that I have offered have generally had decent reception and there are tons of links to them from all over the place as well as thousands of downloads I don&#8217;t feel good about them. The formulas that I used for my own personal cameras and shooting were far more &#8220;accurate&#8221;. The reason for this is that I owned the camera and had images of 1000 different scenes, with diverse lighting, colors, etc, etc. The presets I have release for cameras that I don&#8217;t own were hampered by a lack of image diversity for that particular camera.</p>

<p>If there is a demand out there I will be glad to put the time in to post presets for my newly acquired camera - the Nikon D7000. It will probably take me a few weeks until I am comfortable with them the the wait won&#8217;t be long. While I am at it I will also do D700 presets because I do happen to have the image diversity for that camera as well. S0 why charge money for them? Well the answer is complicated but the two primary reasons are that I take a lot of time to post information on Aperture 3 work-flow on this site. Yes - I post a lot of rants as well but the less opinion oriented stuff actually takes me a LOT of time. These presets will take me a lot of time as well - more than you would expect. Those of you who have contacted me know that I am pretty generous with my time when contacted with specifics via email, etc. I do want to continue this as I enjoy it but want to at least limit that time and support to those that have some level of commitment, even if it&#8217;s only a couple of bucks for cigarettes and beer.</p>

<p>So here goes - anyone interested in paying a couple bucks for Nikon D7000 Picture Control presets for Aperture 3? These will be camera specific - not those ones you see that allegedly cover all cameras that really don&#8217;t cover any of them well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After yesterday&#8217;s stream of consciousness post on my near miss with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043RS864/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B0043RS864">X100 and my D7000</a> impulse buy post I thought I would post some of the other things going through my mind on the state of the union in digital capture devices. Here are a few&#8230;</p>

<ul>
    <li>It is obvious that the X100 is a popular device. The why is obvious as well - a nice looking, compact digital camera with a good lens, coupled with a reasonable viewfinder and simple direct controls for the things that matter the most. I have been harping and longing for this for years. Back in the film days this was the consumer norm and some of these were so so good in terms of lens quality that you couldn&#8217;t beet them with 35mm regardless of price. They were also very very inexpensive. The mark has so far been missed. Very confusing. The M9 is great but that is a completely different ball game in terms of price. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NX13QC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B002NX13QC">X1? - Please</a>. X100 - close but no cigar, and until the price comes into somewhere near reality given that it&#8217;s performance is on par with far far cheaper DSLR&#8217;s a no-go for me. You see this used to be reversed with film - fixed lens compact = cheaper than SLR. Hmmm.</li>
    <li>WTF is with Nikon - they cannot make a compact worth crap and that&#8217;s all were getting with the latest announcements? Really? = Where the heck is the &#8220;D700x&#8221;. By my watch it&#8217;s about 2 years overdue. The latest sony announcements are probably an indicator of what we&#8217;ll see next - a D400 with that 24mpix APS-C sensor is my bet followed a year down the road by the also ran DSLR pack from Nikon getting the same treatment. The big big question is where the hell is any news on the FX front? On that note - the NEX7 is the very first NEX camera I would even consider - too bad it&#8217;s still ugly as hell. I hope we see some better/smaller/nicer lenses for the NEX lineup.</li>
    <li>Speaking of lenses - WTF. I thought that micro-43, and APS-C were supposed to rain down cheaper, smaller, higher performance, faster, super lenses. What did we really get? Hmmmmmmmm. 30,000 variations of plastic zooms with dim apertures - how many different 18-55, 18-70, 16-55, 17-??, 18-105, 18-200, 18-19, f3.5-4 or 5.6 f&#8217;ing zoom garbage do we need. Are they small? some of the crappiest are but anything remotely fast or large aperture is pretty freaking big compared to your typical garden variety 50mm f1.5 of the 60&#8217;s 70&#8217;s and 80&#8217;s. With a few, and I mean a few exceptions the crop sensor lens selection is totally lack-luster and kind of ho-hum - WTF. Where the hell is my 35mm f1.0, my 24mm f1.4, my 70 f 1.2? etc, etc. No-no not the FX ones that are huge and cost an arm and a leg - the ones that cost way way less with APS-C/m43 coverage. Wasn&#8217;t this the original APS-C DX story? <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001S2PPT0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B001S2PPT0">What do I have 10 years later, let&#8217;s see a freaking 35G f1.8</a> - that is about it and I why the hell can&#8217;t I have an aperture ring or a distance scale? Why? 10 years later and I get a neutered freaking f2 class lens?</li>
    <li>Have you seen that<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005BG0IK0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B005BG0IK0"> interchangeable lens camera from pentax</a> with a freaking p+s sized tiny little sensor. Yes it&#8217;s cute and I would buy one just for the hell of it except <em>EIGHT HUNDRED F&#8217;ING DOLLARS. </em>What are these guys smoking. Didn&#8217;t they have enough punishment with that ancient non-selling, 110 format SLR system back in the seventies? When I saw the thing I was thinking &#8220;cooooool, pentax is getting into the APS-C/M43 NEX class market and they make some nice glasssssss&#8221; Then I looked closer - they have come un-hinged.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;x=0&amp;ref_=nb_sb_noss&amp;y=0&amp;field-keywords=kodak&amp;url=search-alias%3Delectronics#?url=search-alias=electronics?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Thank god for Kodak</a> - Nice, really nice new films in ALL formats. Is this as crazy as that Pentax move? I hope not but only time will tell. Please join me in shooting at least one roll of film a month. Please. It looks really really nice and it&#8217;s a nice break from the brain rattling digital march toward hell articulated above&#8230;</li>
</ul>


<p>Have a nice weekend - except for those that are in the hurricane&#8217;s path, like me - you be safe and maybe get a good image or two if you can&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This question comes up all the time. &#8220;Can I upsize the pixel dimensions of an image using Aperture 3?&#8221;. The SuperSimpleStuff™ answer is yes. Here&#8217;s how&#8230;</p>

<ul>
    <li>Go to the export version dialog via the file menu or by right clicking the image you would like to upsize.</li>
    <li>Once there choose &#8220;edit&#8230;&#8221; from the export settings preset list.</li>
    <li>Add a new preset in the dialog that pops up.</li>
    <li>Now there are two ways that you specify increased pixel dimensions. The first way is to just specify a percentage number greater than 100%. The second and probably better easier to under stand option is to use the &#8220;fit within&#8221; option and then specify exactly the number of pixels that you would like on the long side of the image - both numbers can be the same and Aperture will figure out what is the long side.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here is what you are looking for&#8230;</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Ap3Upsize.jpg"></p>

<p>The &#8220;DPI&#8221; setting is not really a whole lot more than allowing other software to understand what the physical target size of the image should be, don&#8217;t worry about it too much. It doesn&#8217;t really alter the actual image dimensions in pixels. Some software does use it to understand the intent of the target display size.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/08/12/your-desert-island-lens/">Remember that lens poll from a week or so back that I posted</a>? I already mentioned that I had an ulterior motive - namely my own personal decision on dropping the cash for a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043RS864/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B0043RS864">Fuji X100</a>. I came to a resolution on that matter and I wanted to share my own personal thought process with you as well as how the poll is related in some strange askew way to that decision.</p>

<p>Please do not take this post as any sort of to buy or not to buy kind of advice or wisdom. It&#8217;s not at all that, consider it entertainment or maybe even just a semi-interesting glimpse in to how my whacky gears grind upstairs. As some of you already know I am a master at rationalizing just about any camera gear purchase. Heck if I have the itch I can even convince myself I am somehow saving money no matter how much the purchase. Trust me I have rationalized purchases that are 10x-20x the cost of a puny stinky little X100.</p>

<p>You may be alble to guess where I landed for my own decision. Here is how it rattled around in my head. In the beginning when the X100 was announced I was thinking &#8220;Very cool - just what I want, count me in&#8221;. Large sensor, nice, small, fast, fixed focal length lens, optical viewfinder, looks nice, real controls for the things that matter, looks like I can get strait to the business of making a picture instead of fiddling with computer shit&#8230;</p>

<p>Time goes by, what feels like a long time. Okay come on already where is this freaking thing&#8230; Some more time goes by and it&#8217;s gonna be here any minute now. Oh oh&#8230; WTF, a freaking Tsunami? F&#8217; the G&#8217;Damn Tsunami. Where the hell is the X100? What the F&#8217; is the holdup? I don&#8217;t get it, it&#8217;s not like there are like 4 guys hand screwing these things togehter. This makes no sense.  What the heck is with these Japanese guys - a little wave or something and you can&#8217;t buy stuff? Heck this is America - you should be able to buy stuff day or night as soon as the thought crosses your mind.</p>

<p>More time goes by, now it&#8217;s the summer. Okay looks like a couple people have them now. Time to buy one for me. WTF - I can&#8217;t buy one from anyone I actually trust like right now? Order it? You don&#8217;t have any idea when it will be in? There are how many orders ahead of me? Screw it let me look on eBay or something. Wot? $1500 - are you f&#8217;ing insane? Go to H&#8217;ll.</p>

<p>More time goes by. Hmmm, looks like it&#8217;s either wait or pay about $1400 to these slime-ball scalpers. Let&#8217;s assess the situation:
* Mixed reviews - OVF + close focus and wide open a no go.
* Fantastic image quality - oooooh let me see - oh they mean you can shoot at like 1,000,000 ISO and the NR makes it all like smoooooth. Hmmm not really that special - not mind blowing. I was hoping for decent. I hear mind blowing but it&#8217;s not mind-blowing. It&#8217;s sorta looks real &#8220;digital&#8221; as in all the images look like &#8220;digital&#8221; cameras from a mile a way. Not bad just very &#8220;digital&#8221;. Hmmmm - how come everyone that says the IQ is mindblowing has like ho-hum images? Not in terms of IQ just in terms of I haven&#8217;t seen really really good images as in content? Maybe the camera has bad luck or something.
* Everyones heard all the ups and the downs and the work-arounds and the counterclaims - screw all that the concenscious seems to be that the MF sort blows and the AF is okay but at the end of the day it&#8217;s a &#8220;delibrate&#8221; camera.
* I have been harping that I want a camera sorta like this but this is really more of a half-measure and a high priced one at that. If I don&#8217;t buy one I&#8217;m sorta a hippocrite and not supporting the companies that are almost getting it - I should support them shouldn&#8217;t I? Maybe they&#8217;ll get it right next time, we wouldn&#8217;t want them to go out of business in the meantime would we?
* Ummmm - 35mm focal length? I&#8217;m not so sure - I mean I have one of the planet&#8217;s best 35mm lenses - same aperture f2 but my 50 is the one I reach for way more. Maybe I am on crack and should just go with the 35mm lens is for real men kinda thought process - nobody else is complaining that the fixed lens is not a 50mm.
* Okay let&#8217;s do a poll - if everyone else on the planet says 35mm is the bomb than it&#8217;s gotta be good enough for me and we&#8217;ll just go with it. $1400 - sheeeeshh WTF?
* Hmmm seems a lot of people like a 50mm vs 35mm, more than I expected. Interesting. I guess I am not crazy. We&#8217;ll okay that was just a delay tactic anyway. Let&#8217;s just get on with it and buy one. You didn&#8217;t think the poll was really going to sway me anyway did you?</p>

<p>So as my itchy trigger finger was hovering over the buy it right now button, deciding what highway robber scum-bag to give 1400-1500 bucks to for a MSRP $1199 camera that <em>should</em> be more like $800-$900 at this point in it&#8217;s &#8220;newness factor&#8221; I thought&#8230; &#8220;Hold on one freaking minute here&#8221;, WTF am I doing? It&#8217;s an APS-C digicam that is absolutely not going to have the rendering I desire. It&#8217;s fiddly and digital enough that I am probably going to end up shooting &#8220;I don&#8217;t really care&#8221; images with it anyway - the fate of every little, fiddly, no DOF, digicam I have ever had before. Not only that but the digital fiddly-stuff like AF is really nothing to write home about. $1500 - Go to H&#8217;ll.</p>

<p>Now you may be thinking at this point I will just save my money right? You also may be thinking that I advocate film so much that I am one of those film guys that would never <em>touch</em> digital. Wrong, I will always shoot both. At least for the forseeable future. For me the X100 has too many &#8220;flaws&#8221; for what I really wanted at an insanely high price. Those flaws would relegate it to more of a toy for me. No way. Now unfortunately I had about $1500 laying around ready to get spent on some sort of camera or something.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what happened, I instantly thought, Hey, I don&#8217;t have anything remotely modern to hook to all that great Nikon glass I have for when I want digital images. I sold my D3&#8217;s a while back and they are way way too big anyway. That&#8217;s why I wasn&#8217;t using them. Next thing you know I bought a factory refurbished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042X9LC4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B0042X9LC4">Nikon D7000</a> for about $1000 and had so much money left over that I shipped it overnight.</p>

<p>Now&#8230; What to do with the extra 500 bucks. Maybe I will grab an X100 with it when the price reflects more of the normal digital one year on rot, they should be about that much then. If not - I can still live without it. My film cameras fit what I really wanted in this type of camera far better anyway. Until a digital camera is at least what I want compared to my film cameras at what I consider a fair and reasonable cost for a disposable item I will just be happy. On the APS-C digital side of things, at least the D7000 does that digital auto-stuff about 10,000 times as well for when there is a call for it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I didn&#8217;t know whether to call this Apertre 3 and film part 0.5 or something else. I choose something else because it&#8217;s applicable no matter if you shoot film or not. Just a tidbit on importing master image files into Aperture 3 using under-utilized import functionality not available in the <em>normal</em> import window that you see when pressing that down arrow icon or popping up automatically when you connect a memory card.</p>

<p>If you look under Aperture 3&#8217;s file menu you will see a sub-menu under import called &#8220;Folders as projects&#8230;&#8221;. There is a lot of functionality rolled up into the dialog invoked with this menu option.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/dialog2.jpg"></p>

<p>The first option drop down in the above dialog &#8220;Import folders as: Projects and albums&#8221; will produce a project named the same thing as the folder that is actually selected and then albums within that project for each sub-folder like this..</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/proj-album1.jpg"></p>

<p>One thing that is not completely obvious here is that the folder that turns into an Aperture poject is whatever folder happens to be selected or highlighted in this dialog. It does not have to be only one folder. You can select multiple folders using the usual tools of shift-clicking for ranges or command-clicking for  multiple, discontiguous folders. Each and every folder that is selected/highlighted in the finder part of the import dialog will become projects. Any subfolders within those selected folders will become albums. The bottom line is that the behavior is depended on what is actually selected in the finder part of the dialog.</p>

<p>Here is what happens when multiple folders are selected in the dialog to give you a clear picture of what happens to the various subfolders within each top level folder. Remember that the projects are the folders actually highlighted/selected in the dialog. The rest of the stuff under those projects are sub-folders.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/proj-album2.jpg"></p>

<p>Now to the film part. I described my fairly draconian but conventional way of physically storing and indexing my film once it is processed. I typically create a folder that corresponds to a roll number for my scans to be loaded into. Just to keep image scans on the same roll in some sort of logical connectedness. I usually will shoot a couple of rolls for a <em>project</em> so I have a project folder that is appropriately named along with sub-folders that are named the same thing as my roll numbers in my physical film files. This method of importing is farily convenient to create a project with albums for each roll of images. Not required but just something I like to have.</p>

<p>I hope you can see how this may also help people that maintain their own file system organization and want to reflect that in various ways inside Aperture 3 as well as those that just want to translate an <em>old</em> folder/file organization into Aperture 3 when migrating to Aperture.</p>

<p>Next time we&#8217;ll cover some of the other options of this very usefule Aperture 3 import dialog. All of this kind of stuff that relates to physical file location, importing, etc. can be found in my <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/aperture-ebooks/">Aperture 3 File Management eBook</a> if you want the full story in one giant connected dose or just as a comprehensive reference.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a few of you know, I have been finding my way out of a commercial way of looking at things for quite some time now. I have a couple of projects that I am working on that I am not even close to be ready to <em>show</em>. All of them are so far from my old way of working that I cannot believe it. One of the things that I do to somehow change my mentality of shooting is to shoot StupidCrap™. This is short hand for anything that crosses my path that interests me in the least, in any way. Subject matter, form, light, anything, even stuff that I can&#8217;t really identify as to <em>why</em> it interests me. When I do this, I really make an effort <em>not</em> to put too much effort into it. I know that sounds strange - to me it&#8217;s totally foreign, as most of my photographic lifetime has been put into every increasing <em>effort</em>.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong here - In some ways I put <strong>Way</strong> more effort into StupidCrap™ than just pointing and shooting. I may shoot it on film and develop and print it myself. I usually choose the focus myself, I usually choose the exposure even if it&#8217;s &#8220;wrong&#8221;. What I don&#8217;t do is put any effort into making it &#8220;better&#8221;. I don&#8217;t direct it, I don&#8217;t manipulate the scene, I don&#8217;t re-light it. I don&#8217;t reflector it. I don&#8217;t replace the people in it with stand-ins. I don&#8217;t shoot 8 different framing and angle variations. I shoot one or two images quickly from my original point of view and that&#8217;s that.</p>

<p>Many of you may actually <em>need</em> to do the exact opposite to go down a path that you desire. Me - I need less of that so that is what I am doing. As the vision for <em>what</em> subject matter I am interested in as well as the photographic treatment I wish to use gells for my long list of projects my intent and leap off a cliff will be to actually show some of these projects.</p>

<p>Realize that I haven&#8217;t really &#8220;shown&#8221; anything in more than a couple of years. I was burnt-out, no matter what the subject matter was - I was not interested in photographicing it. What I was shooting I had no interest in the subject matter anymore. I would never shoot things that wouldn&#8217;t &#8220;work&#8221; commercially or technically. My definition of what would &#8220;work&#8221; had become so narrow and so restricted and so technically oriented, and so so so very much work I honestly felt like anything that was not a major production was without value.</p>

<p>One of the things that facinates me is some of my haphazard StupidCrap™ that I end up looking at over and over with no idea <em>what</em> is causing me to be interested in a particular photo. In speaking with a lot of other photographers out there either in a similar boat as I, or not. One thing that I have found is that <em>all of them</em> have these photographs that interest them that they cannot put their finger on <em>why</em>.</p>

<p>In the interest of potentially interesting conversation, or at least causing you to think about some of these &#8220;why&#8221; type images you might have. The ones that polite folks don&#8217;t actually show others because not even you know the reason why they interest you. I thought I might share a few of mine with you.</p>

<p>Here is one that I shot that I have kept around for more than a month. I guess that&#8217;s my criteria, that gives me lots of ideas but not just that - I cannot for the life of me figure out why I like it.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/SDIM0421.jpg"></p>

<p>Obviously feel free to discus and share some of your &#8220;why&#8221; images as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>More than a couple of you here have decided to shoot just a little bit of film, either with some of your dusty old 35mm gear or with some new found bargain gem from eBay. <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/03/15/we-have-a-winner-the-nikon-f3/">One lucky person is shooting one of my old Nikon F3&#8217;s</a>.</p>

<p>There are plenty of great deals on Nikon 35mm film bodies out there, although as I mentioned last week the trend seems to be somewhat up in terms of prices. I don&#8217;t see near the number of amazing deals that I saw as little as a few months ago. Instead of me generally promoting that you go out and grab some of these for next to nothing, I thought I would start to give a few very specific recommendations.</p>

<p>First off a plain-Jane Nikon FE is probably the best deal around. For some reason the ultra-cheap FE2 of last year seems to be few and far between now. The FE maybe a better choice anyway - you can shoot Non-AI lenses on it. The only thing you really give up is top shutter speed and a slightly strange AE lock compared to the FE2.</p>

<p>Nikon FE&#8217;s are still available in fantastic/near mint shape somewhere between $50-$100. Really nice Nikon FM&#8217;s seem to be a bit more and far fewer - are they drying up? The FE maybe even a better choice than an FM in any case. It has aperture priority AE, a fantastic range of slow shutter speeds, most likely more accurate shutter speeds across the range, and a shutter speed dial that is unbelievabley easy but positive to change with one finger while looking through the viewfinder. The FM shutter speed dial is stiffer and seems somehow smaller. Yes the FE needs batteries but they last almost forever on this camera. Spare button cells take up NO room in your pocket, bag, wallet, whatever. The only thing I really like better about the FM is maybe the viewfinder display because it&#8217;s easier to see the meter in darker environments.</p>

<p>Moving on to lenses on the cheap. There are a bunch of them I would recommend and will post some here but today I want to focus on a fantastically under-rated, under-priced, work of mechanical art. The Non-AI Nikkor 28mm f3.5.</p>

<p>I accidently aquired two of them. One of each major variety. One of them I bought on an impulse for $30 on eBay. How can a lens not be worth $30? The other came with a bunch of other stuff <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/07/07/nikon-cheap-date/">attached to a black Nikon FE</a>. Yes the case and original caps came with it as well. Considering the price of the package, I consider it a freebie.</p>

<p>Here are the two. The first one is the newer, more familiar Nikkor variety. It&#8217;s multi-coated and has fantastic ergonomics. A perfect balance of damping and focus lightness that makes it a joy to use. The other one has the more dated orginial look of Nikkons first SLR lenses. It&#8217;s single coated and has a more damped feel to the focus but still impecable. The older one is actually in mint condition. Not a mark on any of the paint, like it was never used.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/P1020222.jpg"></p>

<p>Both of them are surpisingly good picture makers. In most circumstances you cannot tell them apart on film. These are nothing like budget lenses of today. They came from an era in Nikon where there was no difference in the mechanics, workmanship, or handling of Nikkors. A Nikkor was a Nikkor. Built to last a lifetime and a work of art in and of itself. I swear both of these has the workmanship, fit and finish, and materials that in some ways are <em>better</em> than the newer Leica lenses I have used. All the markings are engraved. No play. Amazing.</p>

<p>I was never interested in these lenses - or any 28mm - when I was buying new Nikon AI/AIS lenses. I bought a 35mm f2 and a 35mm f 1.4. I swear that these lenses are at least as sharp, contrasty, good color, less CA, and possibly less distortion thatn either of those. You do have to put up with a modest aperture but in practice it really is no different than an f2.8 28mm that for some reason brings <em>a lot</em> more money.</p>

<p>Here is a quick snap shot on one or the other of them - don&#8217;t remember which, just to see if it worked.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2011-007-18cn.jpg"></p>

<p>Here is another - again don&#8217;t remember now which was which.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2011-001-13cn2.jpg"></p>

<p>If you really want the convenience of AI you can try to find one that has been factory converted, or even buy the AI version - still a good deal, just not quite as good. I am sure that you can find one like either of these for less than 50 bucks. Maybe even an AI version but you will have to put a little more time and patience into it. Will it <em>ever</em> be worth less? Doubt it.</p>

<p>For my money I would definitly opt for one of these vs the more expensive but pretty much the same f2.8. Will you notice a difference in use - I doubt it.</p>

<p>The really strange thing about the 28 f3.5 is that it has a very large front element compared to the rest of the elements in the design and a very large front element for the maximum aperture. So as an added bonus it&#8217;s very cool looking on the front of a nice metal 35mm SLR.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Anyone living in the DC to NYC corridor <em>knows</em> the nutty amount of rain that we received over the past weekend and beginning of the week. The last of it passed the other evening and as it began to clear at about twilight You could see it moving north / north east in the distance. As I may have mentioned about a million times before, I am no outdoorsey nature photographer kinda guy but I happened to have some old crappy film loaded up and decided to snap a few total guesstimated exposures as the storm travelled on.</p>

<p>As usual I couldn&#8217;t really be bothered to actually go across the street and find a nice looking foreground so you will have to put up with the tops of some silhouetted trees instead. If it were up to me I would just chuck a good looking semi-naked woman in the foreground and light her separately from from the background - as it turns out none were handy.</p>

<p>These were shot with a Nikon FE,  10+ year old Kodak Portra 160VC, and an antiquated Nikkor 85mm f1.8.Post processing consisted of a scan and then some touching up via ACR 6. Why ACR? - well the only scanner software I have seems to want to maximize dynamic range and refuses to believe that film base is actually black and wants to scan it as grey with detail - this introduces massive amounts of scanner noise unless you fiddle with it a bunch. I just use ACR&#8217;s fantastic noise reduction instead - that&#8217;s why. So - using ACR I set the black point to actual black, do a bit of NR to get rid of the scanner noise crop of the borders and there you have it&#8230;</p>

<p>This one was done using aperture priority AE so it wanted to make it look like it was day time&#8230; That strange looking stuff lighting up the center of the clouds is lighting blasting away behind them.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2011-007-24cn.jpg"></p>

<p>These I just guessed an appropriate aperture (probably too small), opened the shutter using &#8216;B&#8217;, waited for a lightning strike and closed the shutter again.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2011-007-26cn.jpg"></p>

<p>Same as above butt this one you can see where the lightning hits the ground - if you look close you can see where it splits in two and also all the little crackly things in the lower portion of the lightning. Click on the images for bigger versions.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2011-007-35cn.jpg"></p>

<p>In all cases the center and upper portions of the frame are the sky above the storm the lightning strikes are under those flashes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t quote Ken Rockwell a whole lot in either private or public. We probably differ on more points that we agree when it comes to details but I generally agree with his intent. Heck he even declares that you should take him with a grain of salt - tongue-in-cheek kind of way. All that aside, I do run across a post of his while googling something that crosses my mind now and again.</p>

<p>Today I was looking for something or another and happend across a post of his from earlier this week. I forget what the post was about but there was something in there about the price of old film gear going up and up and up. He makes some pretty wild claims in the post and I wouldn&#8217;t bet on some of his actual numbers quoted nor agree that it is a fantastic idea to pay a premium price for a NIB Canon A1. There is one thing that I can confirm myself - that is that some film gear is going up. At least the stuff that I sorta track with in a non-clinical way.</p>

<p>I am not talking about <em>investment grade</em> collector&#8217;s cameras, or Leicas, Hasselblads. I am talking about some fairly common, used 35mm gear. It may be a fluke but Nikon FE2&#8217;s seem to be fetching more than they were even a month ago, way more than they were a year ago. FM2&#8217;s seem to always bring more than FE2&#8217;s and still do but you would see a lot of FE2&#8217;s in fantastic shape go for about a hundred bucks. Not so much anymore. Nikon manual focus glass has shot through the roof in the last year and some of the prices I am seeing this month for stuff like the 28 f2 and 35mm f2, etc are twice what they were last year.</p>

<p>I honestly wonder if this is a fluke or there are actually more people getting into 35mm film? You can get some really great deals but even I am finding it harder to buy at the prices I was seeing last year. Seems like you have to take more of a chance on &#8220;iffy&#8221; descriptions or the seller doing a really bad job of describing the item. Here are a few of the deals I would have bought myself today but I got distracted on a phone call and blew it:</p>

<ul>
    <li>FM2 with missing rewind crank (easy and cheap do-it-yourself fix) with 105 f2.5, 55 Micro, some really nice Nikon hoods, a gaggle of filters, and a decent bag. $244. Wow - I could have mde money just by piecing it out. <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/NIKON-FM2-35MM-CAMERA-N8070895-W-CASE-LOADS-EXTRAS-/260833829716?pt=Film_Cameras&amp;hash=item3cbae86354&amp;autorefresh=true#ht_1910wt_903">see</a></li>
    <li>Nikon FM - <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/Nikon-FM-2604625-Film-Camera-Body-Only-/250872398724?pt=Film_Cameras&amp;hash=item3a69290384&amp;autorefresh=true#ht_726wt_1137">body only. $32 </a></li>
    <li>Really nice Nikon FE with what looks like a pristine 50mm f1.4 AIS and a couple of filters. <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/Nikon-Camera-FE-SLR-35mm-w-hard-case-filters-A-shape-/270797659756?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item3f0ccc5e6c&amp;autorefresh=true#ht_500wt_1152">$115</a></li>
</ul>


<p>These were some of the ones that caught my eye. The really funny thing is that there was stuff just like it that was selling for half of the same value within a few hours. Funny.</p>
