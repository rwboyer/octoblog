  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple of photo related thoughts for Friday of the holiday weekend and the unofficial end of summer. Hope all  of you out there have some fantastic plans for the long weekend. Me, I am just going to take it easy and try to get over this summertime flu that I have had for going on a week. So here is the round up of random stuff&#8230;</p>

<ul>
    <li>Love my new D7000 - a bit small for all the controls demanding your attention but not small enough for a compact. Don&#8217;t get me wrong - it makes high quality images very quickly but cannot understand why cameras this big don&#8217;t have FX sensors.It&#8217;s not HUGE but it is at least as big as an FM or FE. Be careful for what you ask for - want a button dedicated to everything? D7000&#8217;s got them but man they are small and jammed up if you are used to using something like a D3. I think there are trade offs to be made and don&#8217;t know if we have seen a perfect balance yet. It seems that we either get tons of um that defy making a camera really compact / really fiddly or we get not enough and a bunch of menu bullshit. In any case my criticism of the D7000 is minor - this is the best DX camera yet. Unless you shoot lots of frames at full blast don&#8217;t worry about the buffer size crap you hear - this thing is fast and is pretty hard to jamb you up taking images of normal stuff, in normal contexts. Honestly, if you can&#8217;t get your shot before you jamb this buffer up you need to rethink what the hell you are doing. The presets for Aperture 3 have been started - man the color is tricky to replicate in Aperture I am thinking that I will be able to either get really close on most of them and totally screw up some not to often seen colors or compromise &#8220;exactness&#8221; for a more universal overall effect. The Nikon blue renderings are a bear to get even near &#8220;correct&#8221; in Aperture 3. On a bright note - the reds are not really off like they were in some older cameras from my test shots so far.</li>
    <li>Clarification on my X100 rant from the other day. I will probably buy an X100 sooner or later. I just will not do it at the ridiculously inflated prices that we have seen. I will also not &#8220;order&#8221; one with no definitive and reasonably close delivery date. My parameters are more likely to be when they are readily available at the typical &#8220;street price&#8221; - meaning a hundred or two less than MSRP from just about anywhere.</li>
    <li>Woooohooooo we get a Fuji X10 in November - who cares. Will I get one ?- maybe. Will it totally kill the LX5? Doubt it. What will probably happen is they will sell for over the MSRP&#8217;s already inflated $600 price tag for quite a while until the technology goes rotten like all digi-cams. I do like the design and I do like that it has an OVF - what&#8217;s not to like about that. Unbelievable that only one guy out there is doing anything close to what photo people have wanted in an alternative camera with the X100. This means we get to pay WAY more than we should be paying. Me - I will wait and see - there is nothing super magical about the X10 or X100 except for that it does get a couple thing right that other companies cannot seem to understand no matter how loud the market screams. I do think if these things are selling for more than $600 when they are actually available that you have to be on crack to buy one of them vs say a NEX or D5100 or whatever.</li>
    <li>The &#8220;tweet&#8221; yesterday from Nikon asking if there were people still shooting film. Of course I answered them. Wonder what possessed them to tweet about film? Curious. Maybe they have had it with digital chaos as well?  Doubt it but still curious. The number of people that still shoot film in Japan is still unbelievable, relatively speaking. Curious?</li>
</ul>


<p>Have a great holiday.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I few days ago, way back before the hurricane, I <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/08/26/new-nikon-specific-aperture-3-product-quiz/">posted a survey</a> to determine if there were people interested in a set of Aperture 3 presets for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042X9LC4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B0042X9LC4">Nikon D7000</a> that emulated Nikon Picture Controls. Based on the results I am going to go forward and put these together. Not today though, I have a touch of some sort of summertime flu and I am miserable and not in the proper mood to approach anything that seems like it needs some sort of coherency.</p>

<p>I received the D7000 yesterday and shot maybe a dozen shots just to see if it &#8220;worked&#8221; and to ponder what I didn&#8217;t like about it. I will get around to a more compete semi-review in the coming days and weeks but for now let&#8217;s say that it&#8217;s not perfect but by far exceeds my expectations. To be blunt my biggest complaint is the body is a little too small given the control layout and my idiotically large hands. Specifically the placement of the AF-L/AE-L button causes me some concern in my normal nikon setup of separating the focus from the shutter release. I sort of jamb my thumb into my forehead when I try this - maybe it&#8217;s just the flu getting the better of me. Well see.</p>

<p>Back to the story of Aperture 3 RAW interpretation being WAY different than Nikon colors - yep, the trend continues for the D7000. The same old story with the same old colors just a wee bit different so as to make my old presets useless. Does Apple randomly figure out how to render colors for Nikon cameras? Who knows, until someone explains this to me I will have to continue to guess at how they might go about it.</p>

<p>For all you non Nikon shooters here is what us Nikon guys are talking about up close and personal for you to see what all the hub-bub is about&#8230;.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ap3.jpg"></p>

<p>See the image on the left - that is an OOC JPEG (NX2 will render the RAW file EXACTLY the same) the image on the right is the Aperture 3 RAW decode. See the difference? This is only showing a few of the colors on a color checker, the rest are whacked out as well. The good news is WB doesn&#8217;t seem to be off the way it was for older cameras. The bad news - wellllll looks like a nice healthy dose of yellow green crossover and a case of too much green in the powder blues - typical.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll get crack&#8217;in on dealing with the presets as soon a my head stops hurting and can hold the camera still for more than 5 seconds.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Actually, I'm okay, everyone I know, and everyone I have ever heard of is okay. Irene was a non-event here in Merry ole Maryland. Of course it was, however, I have been without power since Saturday night at 10pm. This is not at all unusual, my power goes out if it &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;/em&gt; like it's going to maybe be cloudy. The reason for this is I live at the end of a peninsula and the vintage 1950 power lines that service my small community run through 12 miles of state forest.&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<br/>


<p>I actually feel like I am more the victim of Delmarva power than the victim of Irene. The embarrassing thing about this is that all of the non-utility companies like Comcast and Verizon have three or four trucks working on the issue on the same pole intrastructure as the power lines use. Delmarva? Nowhere to be seen, it&#8217;s rediculous. </p>


<br/>


<p>In anycase, I will be posting some content more relevant to all of you as soon as the power is restored. Right now I am just sitting at a wireless hotspot so that I can check my email - probably a more important communication mechanism to me than my phone.</p>


<br/>


<p>Hope everyone else made it through as well as we did.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have about 300 requests for Aperture 3 presets that are camera specific for Aperture 3. I get these in my emails all the time. I have released a few free ones as well as put up a really crappy screencast explaining a general approach to emulating the Nikon out of camera look with picture controls using Aperture 3.</p>

<p>Here is the rub - although I generally think education is the best route and that commercial presets are not people are clamoring for presets that do this. The freebies that I have offered have generally had decent reception and there are tons of links to them from all over the place as well as thousands of downloads I don&#8217;t feel good about them. The formulas that I used for my own personal cameras and shooting were far more &#8220;accurate&#8221;. The reason for this is that I owned the camera and had images of 1000 different scenes, with diverse lighting, colors, etc, etc. The presets I have release for cameras that I don&#8217;t own were hampered by a lack of image diversity for that particular camera.</p>

<p>If there is a demand out there I will be glad to put the time in to post presets for my newly acquired camera - the Nikon D7000. It will probably take me a few weeks until I am comfortable with them the the wait won&#8217;t be long. While I am at it I will also do D700 presets because I do happen to have the image diversity for that camera as well. S0 why charge money for them? Well the answer is complicated but the two primary reasons are that I take a lot of time to post information on Aperture 3 work-flow on this site. Yes - I post a lot of rants as well but the less opinion oriented stuff actually takes me a LOT of time. These presets will take me a lot of time as well - more than you would expect. Those of you who have contacted me know that I am pretty generous with my time when contacted with specifics via email, etc. I do want to continue this as I enjoy it but want to at least limit that time and support to those that have some level of commitment, even if it&#8217;s only a couple of bucks for cigarettes and beer.</p>

<p>So here goes - anyone interested in paying a couple bucks for Nikon D7000 Picture Control presets for Aperture 3? These will be camera specific - not those ones you see that allegedly cover all cameras that really don&#8217;t cover any of them well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After yesterday&#8217;s stream of consciousness post on my near miss with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043RS864/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B0043RS864">X100 and my D7000</a> impulse buy post I thought I would post some of the other things going through my mind on the state of the union in digital capture devices. Here are a few&#8230;</p>

<ul>
    <li>It is obvious that the X100 is a popular device. The why is obvious as well - a nice looking, compact digital camera with a good lens, coupled with a reasonable viewfinder and simple direct controls for the things that matter the most. I have been harping and longing for this for years. Back in the film days this was the consumer norm and some of these were so so good in terms of lens quality that you couldn&#8217;t beet them with 35mm regardless of price. They were also very very inexpensive. The mark has so far been missed. Very confusing. The M9 is great but that is a completely different ball game in terms of price. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NX13QC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B002NX13QC">X1? - Please</a>. X100 - close but no cigar, and until the price comes into somewhere near reality given that it&#8217;s performance is on par with far far cheaper DSLR&#8217;s a no-go for me. You see this used to be reversed with film - fixed lens compact = cheaper than SLR. Hmmm.</li>
    <li>WTF is with Nikon - they cannot make a compact worth crap and that&#8217;s all were getting with the latest announcements? Really? = Where the heck is the &#8220;D700x&#8221;. By my watch it&#8217;s about 2 years overdue. The latest sony announcements are probably an indicator of what we&#8217;ll see next - a D400 with that 24mpix APS-C sensor is my bet followed a year down the road by the also ran DSLR pack from Nikon getting the same treatment. The big big question is where the hell is any news on the FX front? On that note - the NEX7 is the very first NEX camera I would even consider - too bad it&#8217;s still ugly as hell. I hope we see some better/smaller/nicer lenses for the NEX lineup.</li>
    <li>Speaking of lenses - WTF. I thought that micro-43, and APS-C were supposed to rain down cheaper, smaller, higher performance, faster, super lenses. What did we really get? Hmmmmmmmm. 30,000 variations of plastic zooms with dim apertures - how many different 18-55, 18-70, 16-55, 17-??, 18-105, 18-200, 18-19, f3.5-4 or 5.6 f&#8217;ing zoom garbage do we need. Are they small? some of the crappiest are but anything remotely fast or large aperture is pretty freaking big compared to your typical garden variety 50mm f1.5 of the 60&#8217;s 70&#8217;s and 80&#8217;s. With a few, and I mean a few exceptions the crop sensor lens selection is totally lack-luster and kind of ho-hum - WTF. Where the hell is my 35mm f1.0, my 24mm f1.4, my 70 f 1.2? etc, etc. No-no not the FX ones that are huge and cost an arm and a leg - the ones that cost way way less with APS-C/m43 coverage. Wasn&#8217;t this the original APS-C DX story? <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001S2PPT0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B001S2PPT0">What do I have 10 years later, let&#8217;s see a freaking 35G f1.8</a> - that is about it and I why the hell can&#8217;t I have an aperture ring or a distance scale? Why? 10 years later and I get a neutered freaking f2 class lens?</li>
    <li>Have you seen that<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005BG0IK0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B005BG0IK0"> interchangeable lens camera from pentax</a> with a freaking p+s sized tiny little sensor. Yes it&#8217;s cute and I would buy one just for the hell of it except <em>EIGHT HUNDRED F&#8217;ING DOLLARS. </em>What are these guys smoking. Didn&#8217;t they have enough punishment with that ancient non-selling, 110 format SLR system back in the seventies? When I saw the thing I was thinking &#8220;cooooool, pentax is getting into the APS-C/M43 NEX class market and they make some nice glasssssss&#8221; Then I looked closer - they have come un-hinged.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;x=0&amp;ref_=nb_sb_noss&amp;y=0&amp;field-keywords=kodak&amp;url=search-alias%3Delectronics#?url=search-alias=electronics?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Thank god for Kodak</a> - Nice, really nice new films in ALL formats. Is this as crazy as that Pentax move? I hope not but only time will tell. Please join me in shooting at least one roll of film a month. Please. It looks really really nice and it&#8217;s a nice break from the brain rattling digital march toward hell articulated above&#8230;</li>
</ul>


<p>Have a nice weekend - except for those that are in the hurricane&#8217;s path, like me - you be safe and maybe get a good image or two if you can&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This question comes up all the time. &#8220;Can I upsize the pixel dimensions of an image using Aperture 3?&#8221;. The SuperSimpleStuff™ answer is yes. Here&#8217;s how&#8230;</p>

<ul>
    <li>Go to the export version dialog via the file menu or by right clicking the image you would like to upsize.</li>
    <li>Once there choose &#8220;edit&#8230;&#8221; from the export settings preset list.</li>
    <li>Add a new preset in the dialog that pops up.</li>
    <li>Now there are two ways that you specify increased pixel dimensions. The first way is to just specify a percentage number greater than 100%. The second and probably better easier to under stand option is to use the &#8220;fit within&#8221; option and then specify exactly the number of pixels that you would like on the long side of the image - both numbers can be the same and Aperture will figure out what is the long side.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here is what you are looking for&#8230;</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Ap3Upsize.jpg"></p>

<p>The &#8220;DPI&#8221; setting is not really a whole lot more than allowing other software to understand what the physical target size of the image should be, don&#8217;t worry about it too much. It doesn&#8217;t really alter the actual image dimensions in pixels. Some software does use it to understand the intent of the target display size.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/08/12/your-desert-island-lens/">Remember that lens poll from a week or so back that I posted</a>? I already mentioned that I had an ulterior motive - namely my own personal decision on dropping the cash for a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043RS864/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B0043RS864">Fuji X100</a>. I came to a resolution on that matter and I wanted to share my own personal thought process with you as well as how the poll is related in some strange askew way to that decision.</p>

<p>Please do not take this post as any sort of to buy or not to buy kind of advice or wisdom. It&#8217;s not at all that, consider it entertainment or maybe even just a semi-interesting glimpse in to how my whacky gears grind upstairs. As some of you already know I am a master at rationalizing just about any camera gear purchase. Heck if I have the itch I can even convince myself I am somehow saving money no matter how much the purchase. Trust me I have rationalized purchases that are 10x-20x the cost of a puny stinky little X100.</p>

<p>You may be alble to guess where I landed for my own decision. Here is how it rattled around in my head. In the beginning when the X100 was announced I was thinking &#8220;Very cool - just what I want, count me in&#8221;. Large sensor, nice, small, fast, fixed focal length lens, optical viewfinder, looks nice, real controls for the things that matter, looks like I can get strait to the business of making a picture instead of fiddling with computer shit&#8230;</p>

<p>Time goes by, what feels like a long time. Okay come on already where is this freaking thing&#8230; Some more time goes by and it&#8217;s gonna be here any minute now. Oh oh&#8230; WTF, a freaking Tsunami? F&#8217; the G&#8217;Damn Tsunami. Where the hell is the X100? What the F&#8217; is the holdup? I don&#8217;t get it, it&#8217;s not like there are like 4 guys hand screwing these things togehter. This makes no sense.  What the heck is with these Japanese guys - a little wave or something and you can&#8217;t buy stuff? Heck this is America - you should be able to buy stuff day or night as soon as the thought crosses your mind.</p>

<p>More time goes by, now it&#8217;s the summer. Okay looks like a couple people have them now. Time to buy one for me. WTF - I can&#8217;t buy one from anyone I actually trust like right now? Order it? You don&#8217;t have any idea when it will be in? There are how many orders ahead of me? Screw it let me look on eBay or something. Wot? $1500 - are you f&#8217;ing insane? Go to H&#8217;ll.</p>

<p>More time goes by. Hmmm, looks like it&#8217;s either wait or pay about $1400 to these slime-ball scalpers. Let&#8217;s assess the situation:
* Mixed reviews - OVF + close focus and wide open a no go.
* Fantastic image quality - oooooh let me see - oh they mean you can shoot at like 1,000,000 ISO and the NR makes it all like smoooooth. Hmmm not really that special - not mind blowing. I was hoping for decent. I hear mind blowing but it&#8217;s not mind-blowing. It&#8217;s sorta looks real &#8220;digital&#8221; as in all the images look like &#8220;digital&#8221; cameras from a mile a way. Not bad just very &#8220;digital&#8221;. Hmmmm - how come everyone that says the IQ is mindblowing has like ho-hum images? Not in terms of IQ just in terms of I haven&#8217;t seen really really good images as in content? Maybe the camera has bad luck or something.
* Everyones heard all the ups and the downs and the work-arounds and the counterclaims - screw all that the concenscious seems to be that the MF sort blows and the AF is okay but at the end of the day it&#8217;s a &#8220;delibrate&#8221; camera.
* I have been harping that I want a camera sorta like this but this is really more of a half-measure and a high priced one at that. If I don&#8217;t buy one I&#8217;m sorta a hippocrite and not supporting the companies that are almost getting it - I should support them shouldn&#8217;t I? Maybe they&#8217;ll get it right next time, we wouldn&#8217;t want them to go out of business in the meantime would we?
* Ummmm - 35mm focal length? I&#8217;m not so sure - I mean I have one of the planet&#8217;s best 35mm lenses - same aperture f2 but my 50 is the one I reach for way more. Maybe I am on crack and should just go with the 35mm lens is for real men kinda thought process - nobody else is complaining that the fixed lens is not a 50mm.
* Okay let&#8217;s do a poll - if everyone else on the planet says 35mm is the bomb than it&#8217;s gotta be good enough for me and we&#8217;ll just go with it. $1400 - sheeeeshh WTF?
* Hmmm seems a lot of people like a 50mm vs 35mm, more than I expected. Interesting. I guess I am not crazy. We&#8217;ll okay that was just a delay tactic anyway. Let&#8217;s just get on with it and buy one. You didn&#8217;t think the poll was really going to sway me anyway did you?</p>

<p>So as my itchy trigger finger was hovering over the buy it right now button, deciding what highway robber scum-bag to give 1400-1500 bucks to for a MSRP $1199 camera that <em>should</em> be more like $800-$900 at this point in it&#8217;s &#8220;newness factor&#8221; I thought&#8230; &#8220;Hold on one freaking minute here&#8221;, WTF am I doing? It&#8217;s an APS-C digicam that is absolutely not going to have the rendering I desire. It&#8217;s fiddly and digital enough that I am probably going to end up shooting &#8220;I don&#8217;t really care&#8221; images with it anyway - the fate of every little, fiddly, no DOF, digicam I have ever had before. Not only that but the digital fiddly-stuff like AF is really nothing to write home about. $1500 - Go to H&#8217;ll.</p>

<p>Now you may be thinking at this point I will just save my money right? You also may be thinking that I advocate film so much that I am one of those film guys that would never <em>touch</em> digital. Wrong, I will always shoot both. At least for the forseeable future. For me the X100 has too many &#8220;flaws&#8221; for what I really wanted at an insanely high price. Those flaws would relegate it to more of a toy for me. No way. Now unfortunately I had about $1500 laying around ready to get spent on some sort of camera or something.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what happened, I instantly thought, Hey, I don&#8217;t have anything remotely modern to hook to all that great Nikon glass I have for when I want digital images. I sold my D3&#8217;s a while back and they are way way too big anyway. That&#8217;s why I wasn&#8217;t using them. Next thing you know I bought a factory refurbished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042X9LC4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B0042X9LC4">Nikon D7000</a> for about $1000 and had so much money left over that I shipped it overnight.</p>

<p>Now&#8230; What to do with the extra 500 bucks. Maybe I will grab an X100 with it when the price reflects more of the normal digital one year on rot, they should be about that much then. If not - I can still live without it. My film cameras fit what I really wanted in this type of camera far better anyway. Until a digital camera is at least what I want compared to my film cameras at what I consider a fair and reasonable cost for a disposable item I will just be happy. On the APS-C digital side of things, at least the D7000 does that digital auto-stuff about 10,000 times as well for when there is a call for it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I didn&#8217;t know whether to call this Apertre 3 and film part 0.5 or something else. I choose something else because it&#8217;s applicable no matter if you shoot film or not. Just a tidbit on importing master image files into Aperture 3 using under-utilized import functionality not available in the <em>normal</em> import window that you see when pressing that down arrow icon or popping up automatically when you connect a memory card.</p>

<p>If you look under Aperture 3&#8217;s file menu you will see a sub-menu under import called &#8220;Folders as projects&#8230;&#8221;. There is a lot of functionality rolled up into the dialog invoked with this menu option.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/dialog2.jpg"></p>

<p>The first option drop down in the above dialog &#8220;Import folders as: Projects and albums&#8221; will produce a project named the same thing as the folder that is actually selected and then albums within that project for each sub-folder like this..</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/proj-album1.jpg"></p>

<p>One thing that is not completely obvious here is that the folder that turns into an Aperture poject is whatever folder happens to be selected or highlighted in this dialog. It does not have to be only one folder. You can select multiple folders using the usual tools of shift-clicking for ranges or command-clicking for  multiple, discontiguous folders. Each and every folder that is selected/highlighted in the finder part of the import dialog will become projects. Any subfolders within those selected folders will become albums. The bottom line is that the behavior is depended on what is actually selected in the finder part of the dialog.</p>

<p>Here is what happens when multiple folders are selected in the dialog to give you a clear picture of what happens to the various subfolders within each top level folder. Remember that the projects are the folders actually highlighted/selected in the dialog. The rest of the stuff under those projects are sub-folders.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/proj-album2.jpg"></p>

<p>Now to the film part. I described my fairly draconian but conventional way of physically storing and indexing my film once it is processed. I typically create a folder that corresponds to a roll number for my scans to be loaded into. Just to keep image scans on the same roll in some sort of logical connectedness. I usually will shoot a couple of rolls for a <em>project</em> so I have a project folder that is appropriately named along with sub-folders that are named the same thing as my roll numbers in my physical film files. This method of importing is farily convenient to create a project with albums for each roll of images. Not required but just something I like to have.</p>

<p>I hope you can see how this may also help people that maintain their own file system organization and want to reflect that in various ways inside Aperture 3 as well as those that just want to translate an <em>old</em> folder/file organization into Aperture 3 when migrating to Aperture.</p>

<p>Next time we&#8217;ll cover some of the other options of this very usefule Aperture 3 import dialog. All of this kind of stuff that relates to physical file location, importing, etc. can be found in my <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/aperture-ebooks/">Aperture 3 File Management eBook</a> if you want the full story in one giant connected dose or just as a comprehensive reference.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a few of you know, I have been finding my way out of a commercial way of looking at things for quite some time now. I have a couple of projects that I am working on that I am not even close to be ready to <em>show</em>. All of them are so far from my old way of working that I cannot believe it. One of the things that I do to somehow change my mentality of shooting is to shoot StupidCrap™. This is short hand for anything that crosses my path that interests me in the least, in any way. Subject matter, form, light, anything, even stuff that I can&#8217;t really identify as to <em>why</em> it interests me. When I do this, I really make an effort <em>not</em> to put too much effort into it. I know that sounds strange - to me it&#8217;s totally foreign, as most of my photographic lifetime has been put into every increasing <em>effort</em>.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong here - In some ways I put <strong>Way</strong> more effort into StupidCrap™ than just pointing and shooting. I may shoot it on film and develop and print it myself. I usually choose the focus myself, I usually choose the exposure even if it&#8217;s &#8220;wrong&#8221;. What I don&#8217;t do is put any effort into making it &#8220;better&#8221;. I don&#8217;t direct it, I don&#8217;t manipulate the scene, I don&#8217;t re-light it. I don&#8217;t reflector it. I don&#8217;t replace the people in it with stand-ins. I don&#8217;t shoot 8 different framing and angle variations. I shoot one or two images quickly from my original point of view and that&#8217;s that.</p>

<p>Many of you may actually <em>need</em> to do the exact opposite to go down a path that you desire. Me - I need less of that so that is what I am doing. As the vision for <em>what</em> subject matter I am interested in as well as the photographic treatment I wish to use gells for my long list of projects my intent and leap off a cliff will be to actually show some of these projects.</p>

<p>Realize that I haven&#8217;t really &#8220;shown&#8221; anything in more than a couple of years. I was burnt-out, no matter what the subject matter was - I was not interested in photographicing it. What I was shooting I had no interest in the subject matter anymore. I would never shoot things that wouldn&#8217;t &#8220;work&#8221; commercially or technically. My definition of what would &#8220;work&#8221; had become so narrow and so restricted and so technically oriented, and so so so very much work I honestly felt like anything that was not a major production was without value.</p>

<p>One of the things that facinates me is some of my haphazard StupidCrap™ that I end up looking at over and over with no idea <em>what</em> is causing me to be interested in a particular photo. In speaking with a lot of other photographers out there either in a similar boat as I, or not. One thing that I have found is that <em>all of them</em> have these photographs that interest them that they cannot put their finger on <em>why</em>.</p>

<p>In the interest of potentially interesting conversation, or at least causing you to think about some of these &#8220;why&#8221; type images you might have. The ones that polite folks don&#8217;t actually show others because not even you know the reason why they interest you. I thought I might share a few of mine with you.</p>

<p>Here is one that I shot that I have kept around for more than a month. I guess that&#8217;s my criteria, that gives me lots of ideas but not just that - I cannot for the life of me figure out why I like it.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/SDIM0421.jpg"></p>

<p>Obviously feel free to discus and share some of your &#8220;why&#8221; images as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>More than a couple of you here have decided to shoot just a little bit of film, either with some of your dusty old 35mm gear or with some new found bargain gem from eBay. <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/03/15/we-have-a-winner-the-nikon-f3/">One lucky person is shooting one of my old Nikon F3&#8217;s</a>.</p>

<p>There are plenty of great deals on Nikon 35mm film bodies out there, although as I mentioned last week the trend seems to be somewhat up in terms of prices. I don&#8217;t see near the number of amazing deals that I saw as little as a few months ago. Instead of me generally promoting that you go out and grab some of these for next to nothing, I thought I would start to give a few very specific recommendations.</p>

<p>First off a plain-Jane Nikon FE is probably the best deal around. For some reason the ultra-cheap FE2 of last year seems to be few and far between now. The FE maybe a better choice anyway - you can shoot Non-AI lenses on it. The only thing you really give up is top shutter speed and a slightly strange AE lock compared to the FE2.</p>

<p>Nikon FE&#8217;s are still available in fantastic/near mint shape somewhere between $50-$100. Really nice Nikon FM&#8217;s seem to be a bit more and far fewer - are they drying up? The FE maybe even a better choice than an FM in any case. It has aperture priority AE, a fantastic range of slow shutter speeds, most likely more accurate shutter speeds across the range, and a shutter speed dial that is unbelievabley easy but positive to change with one finger while looking through the viewfinder. The FM shutter speed dial is stiffer and seems somehow smaller. Yes the FE needs batteries but they last almost forever on this camera. Spare button cells take up NO room in your pocket, bag, wallet, whatever. The only thing I really like better about the FM is maybe the viewfinder display because it&#8217;s easier to see the meter in darker environments.</p>

<p>Moving on to lenses on the cheap. There are a bunch of them I would recommend and will post some here but today I want to focus on a fantastically under-rated, under-priced, work of mechanical art. The Non-AI Nikkor 28mm f3.5.</p>

<p>I accidently aquired two of them. One of each major variety. One of them I bought on an impulse for $30 on eBay. How can a lens not be worth $30? The other came with a bunch of other stuff <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/07/07/nikon-cheap-date/">attached to a black Nikon FE</a>. Yes the case and original caps came with it as well. Considering the price of the package, I consider it a freebie.</p>

<p>Here are the two. The first one is the newer, more familiar Nikkor variety. It&#8217;s multi-coated and has fantastic ergonomics. A perfect balance of damping and focus lightness that makes it a joy to use. The other one has the more dated orginial look of Nikkons first SLR lenses. It&#8217;s single coated and has a more damped feel to the focus but still impecable. The older one is actually in mint condition. Not a mark on any of the paint, like it was never used.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/P1020222.jpg"></p>

<p>Both of them are surpisingly good picture makers. In most circumstances you cannot tell them apart on film. These are nothing like budget lenses of today. They came from an era in Nikon where there was no difference in the mechanics, workmanship, or handling of Nikkors. A Nikkor was a Nikkor. Built to last a lifetime and a work of art in and of itself. I swear both of these has the workmanship, fit and finish, and materials that in some ways are <em>better</em> than the newer Leica lenses I have used. All the markings are engraved. No play. Amazing.</p>

<p>I was never interested in these lenses - or any 28mm - when I was buying new Nikon AI/AIS lenses. I bought a 35mm f2 and a 35mm f 1.4. I swear that these lenses are at least as sharp, contrasty, good color, less CA, and possibly less distortion thatn either of those. You do have to put up with a modest aperture but in practice it really is no different than an f2.8 28mm that for some reason brings <em>a lot</em> more money.</p>

<p>Here is a quick snap shot on one or the other of them - don&#8217;t remember which, just to see if it worked.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2011-007-18cn.jpg"></p>

<p>Here is another - again don&#8217;t remember now which was which.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2011-001-13cn2.jpg"></p>

<p>If you really want the convenience of AI you can try to find one that has been factory converted, or even buy the AI version - still a good deal, just not quite as good. I am sure that you can find one like either of these for less than 50 bucks. Maybe even an AI version but you will have to put a little more time and patience into it. Will it <em>ever</em> be worth less? Doubt it.</p>

<p>For my money I would definitly opt for one of these vs the more expensive but pretty much the same f2.8. Will you notice a difference in use - I doubt it.</p>

<p>The really strange thing about the 28 f3.5 is that it has a very large front element compared to the rest of the elements in the design and a very large front element for the maximum aperture. So as an added bonus it&#8217;s very cool looking on the front of a nice metal 35mm SLR.</p>
