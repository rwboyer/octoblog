  <div class="entry-content"><p>Anyone living in the DC to NYC corridor <em>knows</em> the nutty amount of rain that we received over the past weekend and beginning of the week. The last of it passed the other evening and as it began to clear at about twilight You could see it moving north / north east in the distance. As I may have mentioned about a million times before, I am no outdoorsey nature photographer kinda guy but I happened to have some old crappy film loaded up and decided to snap a few total guesstimated exposures as the storm travelled on.</p>

<p>As usual I couldn&#8217;t really be bothered to actually go across the street and find a nice looking foreground so you will have to put up with the tops of some silhouetted trees instead. If it were up to me I would just chuck a good looking semi-naked woman in the foreground and light her separately from from the background - as it turns out none were handy.</p>

<p>These were shot with a Nikon FE, Â 10+ year old Kodak Portra 160VC, and an antiquated Nikkor 85mm f1.8.Post processing consisted of a scan and then some touching up via ACR 6. Why ACR? - well the only scanner software I have seems to want to maximize dynamic range and refuses to believe that film base is actually black and wants to scan it as grey with detail - this introduces massive amounts of scanner noise unless you fiddle with it a bunch. I just use ACR&#8217;s fantastic noise reduction instead - that&#8217;s why. So - using ACR I set the black point to actual black, do a bit of NR to get rid of the scanner noise crop of the borders and there you have it&#8230;</p>

<p>This one was done using aperture priority AE so it wanted to make it look like it was day time&#8230; That strange looking stuff lighting up the center of the clouds is lighting blasting away behind them.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2011-007-24cn.jpg"></p>

<p>These I just guessed an appropriate aperture (probably too small), opened the shutter using &#8216;B&#8217;, waited for a lightning strike and closed the shutter again.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2011-007-26cn.jpg"></p>

<p>Same as above butt this one you can see where the lightning hits the ground - if you look close you can see where it splits in two and also all the little crackly things in the lower portion of the lightning. Click on the images for bigger versions.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2011-007-35cn.jpg"></p>

<p>In all cases the center and upper portions of the frame are the sky above the storm the lightning strikes are under those flashes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t quote Ken Rockwell a whole lot in either private or public. We probably differ on more points that we agree when it comes to details but I generally agree with his intent. Heck he even declares that you should take him with a grain of salt - tongue-in-cheek kind of way. All that aside, I do run across a post of his while googling something that crosses my mind now and again.</p>

<p>Today I was looking for something or another and happend across a post of his from earlier this week. I forget what the post was about but there was something in there about the price of old film gear going up and up and up. He makes some pretty wild claims in the post and I wouldn&#8217;t bet on some of his actual numbers quoted nor agree that it is a fantastic idea to pay a premium price for a NIB Canon A1. There is one thing that I can confirm myself - that is that some film gear is going up. At least the stuff that I sorta track with in a non-clinical way.</p>

<p>I am not talking about <em>investment grade</em> collector&#8217;s cameras, or Leicas, Hasselblads. I am talking about some fairly common, used 35mm gear. It may be a fluke but Nikon FE2&#8217;s seem to be fetching more than they were even a month ago, way more than they were a year ago. FM2&#8217;s seem to always bring more than FE2&#8217;s and still do but you would see a lot of FE2&#8217;s in fantastic shape go for about a hundred bucks. Not so much anymore. Nikon manual focus glass has shot through the roof in the last year and some of the prices I am seeing this month for stuff like the 28 f2 and 35mm f2, etc are twice what they were last year.</p>

<p>I honestly wonder if this is a fluke or there are actually more people getting into 35mm film? You can get some really great deals but even I am finding it harder to buy at the prices I was seeing last year. Seems like you have to take more of a chance on &#8220;iffy&#8221; descriptions or the seller doing a really bad job of describing the item. Here are a few of the deals I would have bought myself today but I got distracted on a phone call and blew it:</p>

<ul>
    <li>FM2 with missing rewind crank (easy and cheap do-it-yourself fix) with 105 f2.5, 55 Micro, some really nice Nikon hoods, a gaggle of filters, and a decent bag. $244. Wow - I could have mde money just by piecing it out. <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/NIKON-FM2-35MM-CAMERA-N8070895-W-CASE-LOADS-EXTRAS-/260833829716?pt=Film_Cameras&amp;hash=item3cbae86354&amp;autorefresh=true#ht_1910wt_903">see</a></li>
    <li>Nikon FM - <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/Nikon-FM-2604625-Film-Camera-Body-Only-/250872398724?pt=Film_Cameras&amp;hash=item3a69290384&amp;autorefresh=true#ht_726wt_1137">body only. $32 </a></li>
    <li>Really nice Nikon FE with what looks like a pristine 50mm f1.4 AIS and a couple of filters. <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/Nikon-Camera-FE-SLR-35mm-w-hard-case-filters-A-shape-/270797659756?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item3f0ccc5e6c&amp;autorefresh=true#ht_500wt_1152">$115</a></li>
</ul>


<p>These were some of the ones that caught my eye. The really funny thing is that there was stuff just like it that was selling for half of the same value within a few hours. Funny.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I shoot film, and I use Aperture 3. More than a couple of people have asked me about my work-flow and how it relates to Aperture in my film process. Although I am more than glad to share it, I do have to put a disclaimer out there that my work-flow is somewhat of a mish-mash. This is due in part to the nature of the beast as well as the fact that I am somewhat of a mish-mash and my own internal organization makes sense to me but not nessesarily anyone else. With that being said, on with the show.</p>

<p>First understand that my film world is dived up into a couple of different universes. Maybe universes is not the proper analogy, let&#8217;s use the whole biology related analogy instead - Kindoms, orders, species - remember all that stuff from highschool biology? There is the flora or plant kingdom - black and white. There is the fauna or animal kindom - color. The reason I divide these up is that my work-flow in the analog world is so very different for these two great divides. Yours does not have to be but mine is simply due to the fact that I outsource processing and scanning of my color and develop/scan my own black and white.</p>

<p>For the color work, I shoot it, send it to a lab, and get back then negatives/positives as well as pretty darn good scans that I then import into Aperture 3. That&#8217;s it about as simple as can be.  The scans that I get back are all about the same file size no matter if I shoot 35mm or 120 medium format. This is purely an artifact of the processing/scanning machine that my particular lab uses. These are NOT custom drum scans at super high resolution but they look great for %99.9 of anything I am ever going to need them for. Aperture 3 chews these files up like they were nothing. Very little if any post processing is required and for the most part Aperture 3 is purely an asset management tool and image database.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Ap3Film.jpg"></p>

<p>The other kingdom of black and white is a mixed bag. I don&#8217;t scan every single frame so every single frame is not indexed in a computer somewhere. Sometimes I scan contact sheets, sometimes I scan a roll of negatives at low res/low bit depth on my flatbed, and sometimes I don&#8217;t have a digital record of the entire set of images from roll film. In addition to these scenarios I may choose to scan individual frames at various resolutions. With black and white I also have the absolute requirement of post processing to some degree the raw scans - they are not even close to finished. At the very minimum I need a contrast curve of some sort to even make them look like a strait print. Sometimes I do this in Aperture 3 but other times I cannot due to the gigantic file sizes that I choose to scan. This is especially true if I <em>need</em> a high resolution (4000 DPI) of a large format negative.</p>

<p>Here is the important part of marrying the physical part of my work to the digital part. I have a very strict filing and numbering system for my film. Since film is a physical object and I need to physically order it in some way and in only one way at any given time, I choose to do that by date and sequence. I know that I advise that this may not be the best way to do it digitally with a database but that is due to the nature of a database having the ability to get at the same objects in many different ways - date being the easy one.</p>

<p>Here is my physical filing system:</p>

<ul>
    <li>All black and white roll film gets a roll number consisting of a four digit year and the roll number which is merely a sequence starting at 1 of any given year. With in that roll the frame numbers are inherent and run from 1 to 36, or 1 to 12, or 1 to 10, etc depending on the format.</li>
    <li>All color roll film gets the same treatment as above with a &#8216;C&#8217; tacked on to the end of the roll number.</li>
    <li>Sheet film gets it&#8217;s own unique sheet number consisting of the year and sequencial sheet number. In theory the onese with a &#8216;C&#8217; tacked on the end are color. In practice I don&#8217;t shoot color sheet film for more than a decade. Maybe I will and I will still use the same numbering scheme that I used way back.
*These numbers are assigned when the film goes in the camera and never change. Sheet film is assigned when loaded in the film holders and never change.</li>
    <li>When the film is developed it is put into sleves the roll number/sheet number is written on the sleeve along with some other notes and put in a three ring binder along with matching contact sheets if they exist. These binders are in sequential order, the pages are in sequential order. My files are completely seperate for color roll film, black and white roll film, color sheet film, and black and white sheet film. Get it?</li>
    <li>Based on the roll number or sheet number every single file that gets scanned into my computer gets that same prefex along with the individual frame number along with that &#8216;C&#8217; differentiator. Even if I add an additional suffix to denote some other meaning like scan resolution or bit depth that unique roll number/frame number never changes and is always there.</li>
    <li>Obviously (or not) contact sheets just get the roll number.</li>
</ul>


<p>By strictly adhering to this regimen I am able to look at any image shot on film and retrieve the negative or posative in about 10 seconds if needed. Using Aperture 3 even helps me out when printing in the darkroom. I don&#8217;t have to sorta remember kinda where a negative is filed if I want to print it in the darkroom. I just do a search in Aperture 3 and I have the negative sheet. Done. I used to try this in a custom database back in the 1990&#8217;s but that is pain in the neck.</p>

<p>I try to add lots of keywords to my scans - it&#8217;s easy. I am iffy on the EXIF data and it&#8217;s hit or miss. If I do a &#8220;serious&#8221; scan they I usually take the time to make the EXIF correct if I have the notes from the field. If not, I am usually too lazy to use a  tool other than Aperture 3 to deal with it prior to import so I may add some technical info in the keywords like film type, etc.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. The title of this post is Part 0, if anyone is interested more in film-digital work-flow along with some thoughts on post processing with Aperture and other tools I will be glad to post a smattering of thoughts. This is obviously the very start of my process. I thought I would share it since a few people have asked me how I file my film negatives and digitized counterparts. I know you were looking for a magic answer but this is what I do. Nothing magic, hopefully it will, if not anything else, confirm what you may already be doing just as a sanity check. I will share some other details of how I make this quicker and easier for myself using some Aperture specific features - these might even apply for those of you that shoot JUST digital&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t do a lot of - &#8221;<a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/08/12/your-desert-island-lens/">What&#8217;s your favorite</a>&#8221; Â kinds of posts like the one on Friday. I did have a secret evil ulterior motive though. That motive was to gage how many of you photographer folk out there think they could actually live with a 35mm angle of view as a <em>one and only</em> lens. I have a bunch of 35mm lenses, heck I have the best - a Leica 35mm Summicron ASPH. Problem is I tend to live in 50mm land given the choice and I always have the choice with all of my cameras at the moment.</p>

<p>Why I am dwelling on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043RS864/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B0043RS864">Fuji X100</a>. Ever since this thing was announced I have been on again, off again &#8220;I gotta get one&#8221;. Even with the whole Tsunami <em>shortage</em> thing, even with the highway robbery of vendors selling them more than list price, even with all the negative feedback from reality-land, even with trying to talk myself out of it, I still feel the tug&#8230; The &#8220;I&#8217;m a 50 guy&#8221; seemed to be working as a way not to buy this camera. I got some confirmation from the quiz that a lot of photographers would prefer living with a 50mm. I also got the numbers that say it&#8217;s almost a wash and that I <em>should</em> be happy with just a 35mm.</p>

<p>So - why would I get one? I <em>AM</em> a 50 guy. I am more than enraged that dealers crank the price way above what the manufacturer thinks they are worth (which we all know is inflated from the get-go). It&#8217;s <em>NOT</em> a perfect device. The RAW files are a pain in my already convoluted work-flow. Why Why would I buy one?</p>

<p>Well - I have been ranting and raving at manufacturers for something like this since the dawn of time. Something with a big-ish sensor, a great lens, simple, small, you know - like any of dozens of film cameras from years ago. I should probably put my money where my mouth is and support vendors that try to do this for us. It;s close to what I had in mind if not exactly. I think I will sleep on it a few more days before pulling the &#8220;buy now&#8221; trigger.</p>

<p>Any of you out there vacillating over the X100? It&#8217;s not outrageously expensive for a decent camera and lens. I do wish more manufacturers were really in this same game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I try to follow the blogs of everyone that I know of or had contact with through this little site of mine. Not just to be nice but there are some DAMN fine photographers out there that actually &#8220;get me&#8221; surprisingly enough. Some of them &#8220;Pro&#8217;s&#8221; some of them just DAMN fine photographers that happen to make money in other ways (probably more profitable). In any case if you haven&#8217;t ever taken the time to checkout some of the links to readers blogs that they provide - be sure to do so. I am pretty sure you will find someone that you will learn something from, be inspired by, or even make friends with - they might be close by.</p>

<p>In any case I just started following Patrick La Roque&#8217;s blog today - must have missed his along the way somewhere. A fellow Aperture user that is taunting me to grab an X100. In any case <a href="http://www.laroquephoto.com/blog/2011/07/14/dissecting-the-look-post-processing-in-aperture-3/">he has a nice post on Aperture 3 post processing that I wanted to share</a> and also to comment on. I agree with everything he says in his take - good ideas all of them along with some unique tips. Especially the ones about reducing some of the contrast/saturation/definition selectively where it might not belong - He doesn&#8217;t say it quite this way but hits on something that is really really good to know - it&#8217;s not about how bright ALL THE COLOR is, or HOW CONTRASTY all of the image is, or HOW DEFINED it all is. It&#8217;s all about how the relationships in the image work to give you an impression. In a lot of cases low saturation image overall with some fantastic color contrast in a particular part will come off as MORE. Just read it.</p>

<p>The thing he brings up that is also worth discussion is a point about how just about everything you see has some sort of post and how most photographers are &#8220;embarrassed&#8221; to show OOC images. I agree - just about everything you see has some (large) degree of post. I am not sure this is a great thing - yes yes - the in camera JPEGs have some sort of &#8220;post&#8221; - heck RAWs have the RAW interpreters &#8220;post&#8221;, yes black and white prints have some sort of &#8220;post&#8221; - etc etc. They do but not to the degree that we all see them once presented to the public. One of the reasons that I am not sure this is a good thing is because when you are looking at images in the context of photographers talking to photographers it&#8217;s not really that clear about the amount of &#8220;post&#8221;. In fact I have complained over and over again about how misleading most of the &#8220;educational&#8221; material out there is when I look at the images associated with the &#8220;education&#8221; that have been clearly &#8220;post processed&#8221; but they are positioned as &#8220;minimal&#8221; or even &#8220;none&#8221;. Â Complete bullshit.</p>

<p>I guess you could rationalize this in saying that &#8220;The audience should understand what is what - they have eyes don&#8217;t they?&#8221;. I think this rationalization is bullshit, especially if the &#8220;education&#8221; is on in-camera technique things such as lighting. The vast majority of photographers out there that will be reading that kind of material does not have a ton of experience in separating what is a lighting effect vs what is a post-processing effect so they follow the recipe exactly as presented and end up with results that look nothing like the author&#8217;s or presenter&#8217;s. They thing they did something &#8220;wrong&#8221; - they attribute it to the wrong things like their camera, their lens, something - when actually it was that &#8220;minimal&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221; post that was actually not - &#8220;none&#8221;.</p>

<p>While I can see the rationale about not showing retail consumers your OOC images if you are &#8220;selling&#8221; that client I think it&#8217;s poppycock not to show photographers that you are trying to &#8220;educate&#8221; either for &#8220;free&#8221; or for profit through workshops, etc. In fact if you already have sold a job to an art director, etc. I think its poppycock not to show them work OOC for their job. I would hate to be &#8220;embarrassed&#8221; by my OOC images. Maybe I come from a time gone by but jesus, whatever happened to showing clients contact sheets that were pretty much &#8220;OOC&#8221; standard C41 or E6 film that was contact printed? God, even in digital I shot tethered so the MUA, art-director, etc could actually help me.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. I think it is far more interesting to see photographers contact sheets and OOC results in many was their work product in a lot of contexts than it is to see the washed-ironed-and-dryed final product. Maybe I depend on the audience here to understand what <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2010/02/17/beater-camera-follow-up-nikon-d2h-the-beast/">OOC results actually look like</a>. They don&#8217;t have to be &#8220;flat&#8221; and &#8220;bad&#8221; of course they can be juiced up and even made &#8220;perfect&#8221; with a little &#8220;minimal&#8221; post but who cares if you are talking about how a camera or lens behaves, talking about shooting, or talking about lighting.</p>

<p>Pss.</p>

<p>Sorry for the rant - read Patrick&#8217;s post.</p>

<p>Psssss.</p>

<p>If you see anything here that is NOT OOC you will know exactly what &#8220;minimal&#8221; was. Please hold me to that as if I miss something I surely intend to be transparent .</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here is the question - if you were <em>stuck </em>with only one lens of one focal length which one would that be. I am only talking about focal length here in terms of angle of view - not the <em>real</em> focal length. For arguments sake lets discuss this in 35mm equivalent terms since everybody is familiar with that and most software and cameras will do the EXIF conversion for you. I guess the question of both your mind&#8217;s eye and what you think would be best in some combination of what focal lengths you <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2010/09/25/aperture-3-more-fun-with-metadata/">actually use the most as I mention here as an interesting study</a> for you to do some introspection.</p>

<p>For me - it has got to be a 50mm both in terms of how I feel and the reality that seems to creep into my actual use based on hard numbers, now that I can easily get there. How about you? Feel free to include other very specific conditions that are must haves for you in comments - I am always interested in what people think are essential qualities - like maximum aperture, no-or-low distortion, wonderful bokeh, whatever. Try not to pick lenses that don&#8217;t exist in reality if you comment&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My email in-box continues to astound me. Some of the questions and inquiries that I get are perfectly predictable from readers of my little corner of the web. Others I would never predict. Like the one asking me what the &#8220;whole picture looked like&#8221; for one of the little crops that I use for post icons in the blog design. In a lot of cases the icons are only tangentially related to the subject matter of a particular post. If there are images in the icon will be one of those images cropped. In cases were I choose not to include any images in the post itself I just randomly crop an image I have laying around my desktop.</p>

<p>The icon in question was for <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/07/16/old-camera-new-film-new-camera/">this post</a>. Nothing special but here it is&#8230; I aim to please, click for larger version.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2011-006-24cn.jpg"></p>

<p>Probably more interesting as an icon to tell you the truth. I am not much of a landscape guy. This just happens to be a snap I took while out doing a mini-workshop of film behavior and spot metering here locally. Not a bad image but it was at the end of a very hot, humid, steamy, hazy, soupy day we had here a while ago. This translates into low contrast in the distance (sometimes good but hard to pull off without the right scene) and blah colorless, cloudless skies. I guess the horsey-s are nice.</p>

<p>Shot with a 1970&#8217;s Nikon FE - a 1960&#8217;s Non-AI single coated 50mm f1.4 lens on re-branded buck a roll fuji color neg 200 ISO film.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is going to be a two faceted post. Based on the title you can assume some magic <em>secrets</em> pertaing to Aperture 3&#8217;s sharpening tools. Well I will comment on those but to give you some context before I get to Aperture, I will discuss sharpening in general. Althought sharpening as pertains to digital imaging has been discussed ad nausium, I still find the vast majority of digital photographers really don&#8217;t have a good handle on what&#8217;s what in the world of sharpening based on the number of questions I get in comments and even more in emails.</p>

<p>Without going too far into the weeds on the history of sharpening we should all start with the rudimentary idea that sharpening in the digital world was thought of as nessesary to counteract a lot of de-sharpining inherent to the digial process. Be it in degrading effects of scanning images or AA filters on most direct digital capture devices. Over time it has morphed more into an <em>effect</em> that pervades all of our visual vocabularies. We don&#8217;t even see it as an effect anymore. If you explore prototypical images over the last 20 years you can clearly see the massive increase in edge contrast evolve not-so-slowly in just about all of the normal images we consume in our daily lives.</p>

<p>I am not talking about some massive increase in detail - just edge sharpness. With that in mind understand that at the end of the day - how your images look, and how well they fit what you are trying to convey win out over any <em>right or wrong</em> way, or forumlatic approach. If it looks right to you then it is right. My purpose here is to give you some idea why your images might not look like you want them to and put you on the path to get there.</p>

<p>Fast forward - it has been said many times that the amount of sharpening depends on how <em>big</em> your image file is. While somewhat true, I think that this is highly misleading because it separates all of the important context from the <em>bigness</em> of the image file. The really important part is not really the image file size, it&#8217;s the resolution of the output medium as well as some of the more minor characteristics related to that medium.</p>

<p>Take that in for a moment to understand why sharpening treatment should be way different for an image meant to display on a typical 75-110 DPI computer screen vs a 240-300 DPI printer or even a Durst with ColorByte RIP at 400 DPI. For the most part you don&#8217;t need to worry too much about the difference of 75-100 DPI however the difference between 240 to 400 DPI on a printing device could be significant.</p>

<p>The reason that the target output and viewing resolution of the image is so important is that it and it alone determines the actual physical edge size that you are manipulating with sharpening. A line drawn 1 pixel wide using 75dpi pixels is clearly visable. A line drawn 1 pixel wide using 300 dpi pixels - not so much. To have the same sharpening effect that you see on a 75-100dpi output device on a 300dpi printing device the edge that you are sharpening has to have the same physical width. Get it?</p>

<p>Virtually all sharpening tools alow you in one way or another to control the width of the edges that you are *enhancing&#8221;. Usually this control is called the radius. This is the most important parameter and what settings you may want to use are completely dependent on the output resolution of your target device to achive any given look you have in mind.</p>

<p>If we cut to the chase a reasonable range of values for screen out put is anywhere from 0.5 to 1.0 pixels. The value you choose has more to do with how you want the image to look vs any right or wrong standard. When it comes to printing there are many other variables but the edge width or radius that you choose again has everything to with the target mediums output resolution. As a way to speak generally about printing, lets assume that for any give size you will be sending a file that has 300 DPI to the printer. Reasonable values for printing are somewhere in the neighborhood of 2.0 - 3.0 pixels. The reason is again to make the edges have a specific physical width on paper.</p>

<p>The variables you have to deal with in printing have to do with the actual material that you are printing on, the target viewing distance of the audience, and to some lesser degree the characterisitcs of the printing device itself. A lot of these are more of a fine tuning exersise than critical elements and can only be understood for your own personal goals via experience.</p>

<p>Moving on to the other basic controls, the venerable unsharp mask type enhancements give you amount and threshold in addition to radius. The amount parameter being how much contrast you want to had to the edge width defined by the radius you chose. The threshold is for determining what level of contrast is actually and <em>edge</em>. Threshold is a crude way to avoid sharpening things that you may not want to emphasize fine texture, noise, and film grain. The newer, more better, sharpening tools add more sophisticated ways or algorithms to avoid sharpening things you don&#8217;t want emphasised but masking the good ol&#8217; USM is just as effective if not more so.</p>

<p>I hope that you can extrapolate a few things from the preceeding illumination. If not, here they are. For the best possible results your work-flow should look something like this:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Resize your image to the target output medium and display size</li>
    <li>Sharpen choosing the radius range based on the output resolution and the other parameters how you want your image to look.</li>
</ul>


<p>In the case of sharpening for screen ouput you will typically choose the physical pixel demensions as the <em>size</em>, as in 1024, 800, 600, etc. Do the resize, Sharpen at 0.5-1.0 radius. For printing you will typically choose what print size you want and a resolution optimized for the printing device, 240dpi, 300dpi, 400 dpi, etc. Then sharpen with a radius from 2.0-3.0 prior to sending your image file.</p>

<p>The whole goal here is to avoid as much as possible resampling the actual sharpening. In most cases <em>downsizing</em> a print sharpening treatment for screen display will not look that great. On the printing end it is also preferable not to sharpen a gigantic file meant for a 20x30 print at 2.0 pixel radius downsampled for a 8x12 print. Of course those results may be <em>good enough</em> for quick and dirty work but generally will produce inferiour results to sharpening a file that is sized approriately for the output intent.</p>

<p>Okay, now we are at the Aperture 3 part. You can probably predict my feelings at this point about the tools that Aperture 3 provides in terms of sharpening. There is nothing wrong with them but in my opinion they are way too cumbersome to use for anything but quick and dirty casual work. This is purely due to the fact that there is no way to have the sharpen effect take place with the appropriate parameters after the output resize. It always happens before the resize and then is upsampled or more likely downsampled for exports and printing.</p>

<p>The only way to deal with sharpening in Aperture is by trial and error, messing with various prameters in the sharpening adjustment block(s), until you find settings that happen to look good at various ouput sizes. For me this is <em>way</em> to fiddly, error prone, and time consuming for anything remotely critical, including producing web output that looks good for clients. It&#8217;s fine for crap I don&#8217;t care about that I post on my blog - for clients and images that need to look their best - not so good. I do all of my <em>real</em> work resizing and sharpening in Photoshop.</p>

<p>If most of your work is casual and you really want to do it in Aperture alone there are a few reasonable ways to go about it. One is to make presets that look reasonable for various output devices and sizes by trial and error. Then use those presets on different versions of the image target for those particular outputs. Another way would be to rezise and export the image as a TIFF, import the resized image back into Aperture, then sharpen that image for its intended outupt device, finally exporting it at that same size. Last but not least - a tool like Nik Define attempts to take all these things into account for you based on the target medium and output size. Unfortunately I sill think that this plug-in is too fiddly and does not deal with most real-world work-flows in reasonable ways.</p>

<p>Please take all this with a grain of salt. I am being ultra-finiky here and trying to be give you as much information on the important variables for you to know how you may want to approach image production across a lot of different circumstances. The main point to take away is the criticality of the radius paramerter is with respect to the output resolution in determining the real physical edge size that is ultimately produced. This more than anything controls how the perceived sharpness of your images will actually look.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. Sorry for all the wordi-ness.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WJR69E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B003WJR69E">I still love my little LX5</a>. I know I have been a little down on digital lately. I don&#8217;t mean to be, I still love film, and especially love the simple, effective, and often beautiful equipment used with film. I really do hope that some manufacturer (in additional to Leica) will eventially produce a simple, small, high quality digital camera with a big giant sensor. I hope even more that the trend toward really complicated, big, heavy, feature laden zooms gives way to lenses that actually <em>look</em> better. Right now only Leica seems to make such things at idiotically high prices. Not so long ago <em>everyone</em> did.</p>

<p>Back to the subject at hand, I have had the LX5 for more than a year and still that little device amazes me. Exposure system is fantastic, customization is fantastic, handling is pretty good for an itty bitty camera. More importantly the response is actually pretty snappy - my biggest complaint with digicams up until about 2010. Quality is leaps and bounds better than point and shoot digicams of a few years ago and the lens is absolutely amazing for such an inexpensive consumer device.</p>

<p>The LX5 lens has a bit more than a bit of barrel distortion at the very widest setting, at least it&#8217;s simple barrel distortion from what I can see. Easily corrected in post if nessesary (rarely) as you get to the mid and tele end of the zoom it is actually very well controlled as evidenced in the attached photos. I have no idea if CA is somehow auto-magically corrected in both JPEG&#8217;s and RAW files but there isn&#8217;t a hint of it relative to most lenses - even good ones. The optical image stabilization is so effective I swear it&#8217;s better than <em>any</em> of the Nikon VR lenses I have ever used. At the end of the day - what&#8217;s to complain about for a carry around camera?</p>

<p>I know there are a few worth competitors out there now. I actually have a Canon S95 now through a quirk of fate. No I didn&#8217;t buy it for the reasons I listed a while ago. If I have a few minutes this month I&#8217;ll try do do a shoot-out for anyone that&#8217;s interested at this point given that both of them are like really old now. For some reason the little LX5 still seems like one of the best choices out there - even a year on. Even better at 100 bucks less than it&#8217;s introduction.</p>

<p>Here are two snaps I made right before dinner of a female red throated humming bird out on the porch.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So far I have upgraded one of my Apple Macs to Lion. Aperture and Photoshop and the rest of my software appear to function as they should. By no means have I done any extensive testing but the initial toe in the water has been favorable.</p>

<p>The machine that I choose would take the first plunge into Lion was my miniscule 11 inch MacBook Air of the previous generation. It runs fast and surprisingly I am loving a lot of the new <em>iOS</em> type features, especially on this Mac. The <em>reversed</em> scrolling behavior of the touch pad is extremely difficult to get used to and I am not sure tha I am going to keep it this way. While it seems natural on the iPad and iPhone devices where your hand is actually touching the screen. It seems extremely awkward and backwards when the screen you are looking at is perpendicular to the touch pad device being used to manipulate it.</p>

<p>I actually use the little MBA for <em>real</em> work like Photoshopâ¢ and Aperture 3â¢. The last Aperture 3 SuperSimpleStuffâ¢ post was written and tested on the Air as you may have notieced by the demensions of the screenshots. On my big iMac some of the new features may not be as useful but I will give them a chance.</p>

<p>While I am positive that I will run into some glitches so far so good. Overall Lion has been one of the smoooothest in-place OS X upgrades that I have experienced. I only have two days on teh clock with it but I am thinking that the 27 inch iMac will be upgraded very very soon.</p>

<p>One word of warning for those of you using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dnik%2520sofftware%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%23&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Nik Software</a>. Nik claimed that their current versions work fine with Aperture 3 and LightRoom. I happen to use Photoshop CS5 for Nik. There was an issue with with installing fresh copies of Nik&#8217;s products with CS5 althought they claimed that any software installed previously would continue to work. Nik has solved the CS5 installation issue for most of their plug-ins - at least the ones that I use - that made me nervous - so I delated the Lion upgrade until that was resolved. There are still a couple of products that have this issue, check <a title="Nik FAQ" href="http://www.niksoftware.com/support/usa/entry.php?view=faqs/general_answers.shtml">Nik&#8217;s update site</a> for real-time updates if this concerns you.</p>

<p>I will keep you updated with further developments.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. Anyone out there that actually likes the reverse track-pad behavior tht OS X Lion turns on by default?</p>
