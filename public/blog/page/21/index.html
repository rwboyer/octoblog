  <div class="entry-content"><p>First - I wanted to thank all of you that have upgraded to the new version of the Aperture 3 eBook but this post is really for any new Aperture 3 Organization eBook customers since it&#8217;s release a few days ago. That means anyone that purchased the new version at the full price for the first time.</p>

<p>For some reason two people have contacted me (out of way more than that) that told me they actually got the download for the OLD VERSION for Aperture 2. I have checked and rechecked all of the paypal links and cannot see an issue but I have fixed it so that can&#8217;t possibly happen now. In any case if you bought the Aperture 3 version within the last week please please check the title - it should say Aperture 3, if it says Aperture 2 you got the wrong version. Please email me with your paypal email address and I will rectify the situation.</p>

<p>Thank You</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been a big big fan of David Alan Harvey&#8217;s work ever since I saw it in NatGeo when I was a kid. To tell you the truth he is sort of a long time hero of mine. His images speak to me a whole lot more than most. Never met him - we travel in way different circles, even when I was doing commercial work we were so far apart in the work we did it&#8217;s not funny. To be very candid he has always been sort of a hero of mine.  I guess it&#8217;s because he is one of the very few people where I say to myself that I would love to do what he does throughout his career this has been true.</p>

<p>No I mean that in just about every sense. I wish I could shoot the subjects he shoots and I wish I could shoot them as well as he does and and and, the list goes on and on. Anyway just got done visiting with a long time friend and photojournalist. As usual photography talk comes up - usually him asking me about some digital work-flow crap but this time I had something new - I told him about my E-P1 plunge. I thought this would blow him away - considering I never owned a point and shoot digicam ever. Nope he took it in stride and say &#8220;I&#8217;m sure it will work fine - David Allen Harvey shoots with a GF-1 a lot&#8221;. I was like - really, I thought he was a Nikon and especially a Leica guy.</p>

<p>Yea maybe I am the only one in the dark that the quintessential minimalist was shooting a GF-1 but hey I don&#8217;t follow a lot of gear related stuff. I have always understood and respected Harvey for his minimalist gear choices, his agnostic approach to imaging technology, meaning whatever works best for him and especially that he rolls with the punches in the rough and tumble photographic world of gear, digital, etc. He has a very basic approach and a very down to earth policy, use whatever he feels like using. Digital - film - whatever - Medium format. I have know that so I guess a GF-1 is not a stretch is it?</p>

<p>Would someone please clue me into these things before I go make an idiot out of my &#8220;bold moves&#8221; with my photographer buddies.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/DSC_9596-Land-Version-2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2263" title="DSC_9596 Land - Version 2" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/DSC_9596-Land-Version-2-300x136.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="136" /></a>I know I drone on and on about this but I thought a few of you Aperture/Nikon shooters out there and maybe even some Leica M9 shooters may find it interesting there seems to be a strange connection in the way that Aperture renders NEF color and the way the Leica M9 renders color in it&#8217;s JPG&#8217;s. Well not really a connection but an interesting similarity of &#8220;issues&#8221;. This is going to take some leaps of faith on your part to follow along. This is a code word for (warning long diatribe)</p>

<p>Ever since Aperture&#8217;s introduction I have been &#8220;un-happy&#8221; with Apple&#8217;s default rendering of NEF files. For older cameras to a large degree and newer cameras to a lesser degree. Let&#8217;s ignore for a second the contrast default curves as those are not that important or hard to deal with. Let&#8217;s ignore variations in saturation and other in-camera settings that tweak things like contrast and saturation. Let&#8217;s only talk about hue. For the most part this has been my big issue. I am not a newb when it comes to color, color management, shooting color, manipulating color in the darkroom or digitally. When I shot color commercial work color was absolutely critical - heck I even have a color meter that I haven&#8217;t used in years. So please don&#8217;t write this observation off as someone that doesn&#8217;t understand WB and color and RAW.</p>

<p>There are obviously two ways to evaluate color - qualitatively and quantitatively. in other words - the &#8220;rightness&#8221; of colors and the pleasingness of color renditions. For the most part my issues with Apple and Aperture on on both counts. I really do not give a hoot about the &#8220;why&#8221; they seem to insist on doing NEF color wrong - wrong in some cases as straying from accuracy in some hues, wrong as in most people that shoot Nikons tastes, and wrong from way way off the makers JPG renditions - again I am talking hue  - not saturation, not contrast curve. I am talking measurable numbers - like hue number 221.</p>

<p>I have tried for years out of curiosity and frustration for someone at Apple to fix this 3 faceted wrongness in all ways or at least one of the three ways it&#8217;s &#8220;wrong&#8221;. No, no, no - you don&#8217;t have to read the in-camera settings and match the JPG in every way, for god&#8217;s sake please just make the hues accurate, or pleasing, or the same as Nikon. Please - even one of the three would be okay - pick any one. Over the years I have had a grand total of ONE guy at Aperture that was actually an engineer correspond with great interest and ask me for data and and after TWO emails he was silenced never to be heard from again. With no luck at any apparent change in philosophy,I struggled to find out why, why, why - I think the answer lies both in WB interpretation which boggles my mind on how this is possible AND wrongness of color hues even if the WB was exaclty the same.</p>

<p>For the life of me the only thing I can imagine is some Apple guy dubbed in charge of Nikon NEF color is isolated in his little color offices with a freaking macbeth chart and one color temp of light source - &#8220;the official&#8221; one. From there he tries to get his limited HSL samples on that chart to look the most exact he can, with them all being not quite exact but off by the same amount which he considers mission accomplished. The reason I imagine this is that the Leica M9 color rendition seems to be plagued by the same general theme in both it&#8217;s camera produced JPG&#8217;s and it&#8217;s officially included software, Lightroom. I don&#8217;t know any M9/Aperture guys but I do have some test files that I can see for myself what they are like in Aperture along with the JPG&#8217;s - I will bet you it&#8217;s the same.</p>

<p>The theme goes like this..</p>

<ul>
    <li>Blues are too green</li>
    <li>Yellows are too green</li>
    <li>Reds suffer random issues - too cool too warm (too purple/too orange) depending on how planets are aligned, what day of the week you shoot, and what you had for breakfast last tuesday.</li>
</ul>


<p>Sound familiar? Here is the funny part - every single M9 shooter that I have communicated with that has stumbled across my rants on color via google + Lieca + Lightroom + Aperture or whatever frustration keywords that lead them here have a &#8220;color preset&#8221;  that look exactly like most of my Nikon presets for Aperture with very minor variation. Go figure. I guess the Kodak/Leica color guy and the Aperture/Nikon color guy went to school together. They are on the phone with each other talking about how stupid all of us idiots are that don&#8217;t appreciate how much more &#8220;accurate&#8221; they are as measured by some overall self-invented accuracy aggregated number - let&#8217;s call it five. They are reveling in how good the puce patch number 3 in the lower left looks that everyone else is of by .0001234 degrees on where they nail it. Well that maybe so Mr Lieca color and Mr Apple/NEF color but I can tell you right now your freaking sky is cyan not powder puff blue.</p>

<p>Sorry - there has to be at least one of you that get&#8217;s some satisfaction out of being in the same boat as a bunch of other people.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/EP-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2260" title="EP-1" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/EP-1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>Remember I was looking for a small camera to jamb in the bag with my Leica M kit? I was thinking of a D5000, an Olympus 4:3, etc. Well after a few weeks of vacillating and fence sitting. I decided to get on with it and bought a Olympus E-P1. Yea I know I was gravitating towards the E-PL1 because as we all know that newer equals better in the digital world. I will tell you how I decided on the E-P1 and how it holds up in reality once I have some time with it under my belt.</p>

<p>The guts of all of the Olympus Pen digital cameras are pretty much the same with various firmware/software differences accounting for a large part of any feature differences. Yes there are some other improvements in the newer cameras. Apart from that there are materials differences. E-P1/P2 being lush and E-PL1 being hmmmm. not. I like metal it feels good and the E-P1 looks fantastic. There is no forking way I am paying for an E-P2 with the guts being the same - no way. Yea the E-PL1 can hook up an EVF but I am not that into it - if/when I am I will go for whatever is newer better at that time. I am not going to put a 300 dollar viewfinder on a 500 camera - actually the camera is a lot cheaper if you factor the lens cost that is included but NOBODY would buy it w/o the lens it cost almost the same for body only.</p>

<p>So I guess the logic is - I would rather the less bothersome interface and controls of the E-P1 and the nicer looking/feeling camera than I would the &#8220;option&#8221; of buying a 300 dollar viewfinder. If I love this thing we&#8217;ll see what happens down the road. Oh there is one more factor - I found a brand spanking new E-P1 for 100 bucks less than the E-PL1. I downloaded full size images for both and they are the same sooo&#8230; for chump change I get a decent imaging device that cost less than my light meters and will fit nicely in my bag with the Leica gear.</p>

<p>The D5000 is just too damn big and on top of it all I found a bunch of raw files from the same shooter under the same conditions of the same subject and the E-P1 actually was BETTER so how can I go wrong? I guess I will let all of you know how it goes wrong as I figure it out. Wish me luck, you know I am a brutal critic of flaws.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/GLMedia-639-Version-3.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2255" title="GLMedia 639 - Version 3" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/GLMedia-639-Version-3-300x136.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="136" /></a>Or any other &#8220;presets&#8221; for that matter are not evil. I feel compelled to say that and get my official position out there after some mis-understandings of prior posts and a few emails regarding the subject after my &#8220;HDR preset&#8221; post went viral. First off, I do use presets, my own, not presets I buy. I however am not a fan of for sale presets. I will re-explain why in a second without the subtle sarcasm so I am clear along with some advice in setting up your own preset library.</p>

<p>Just for the record my over the top &#8220;HDR preset&#8221; was not intended as a real tool to be applied to photos willie-nillie. People that read a lot of my posts know my feelings on the current state of HDR. It was also not a joke - I was not making fun of anyone - nor was I trying to be nasty. I sincerely intended it to be an introduction to the &#8220;advanced&#8221; sliders in Aperture&#8217;s Highlight and Shadows control which in my opinion and experience is the best tool of it&#8217;s kind available today. A little bit goes a long way and it is immensely powerful when you start to work with the low tonal width, high tonal width, and other &#8220;advanced&#8221; controls. They really are not that advanced and I don&#8217;t know why Apple hides them away by default. With Highlights and Shadows I can get 99% of the way to just about any of the tone-mapped HDR images I have ever seen - not that I want to but that is just my taste. I can also do more photographically realistic things as I personally define them. With a little Dodge and burn here and there I can get 99.9% of the way there. There really is nothing as powerful in any other software right now. You may say will LR has fill light - not even close.</p>

<p>Now on to why I am not a big fan of commercial presets. Reason one is that there is are not really any huge set of wildly diverse complex tools in either Aperture or Lightroom that warrant putting how hard won cash to have them orchestrated for you. Really there aren&#8217;t, there are a couple of sliders. The most complicated thing is probably the &#8220;curves&#8221; tool and that isn&#8217;t real complicated. With about 30 seconds worth of effort just about anyone can get whatever result they would like by just looking at some image you like and getting to the same place - there are no proprietary &#8220;secrets&#8221;. Plug-ins and complex Photopshop actions are a completely different story.</p>

<p>Second - there are no facilities to deal with organizing any kind of coordination between presets in either Lightroom or Aperture 3. What people do and what adjustment blocks are used for what things are all over the map so&#8230; They may completely annihilate your work-flow. Certainly the only rational way to go about using them is preset first and tweak from there. This may be okay for you but&#8230;. it sort of defeats the purpose of presets if you go in an fool with images individually. Just my opinion.</p>

<p>Third - closely related is that there is no standard way set up among one purveyor of presets let alone across a few suppliers. They pretty much stomp all over each other so the only rational way of dealing with them is one and only one preset. If you look at  Apple&#8217;s and most of Adobe&#8217;s pre-supplied presets they are sort of organized into one adjustment block at a time wherever possible - there are a few that use a couple different ones. Haver you seen the ones that people buy?</p>

<p>In my opinion they can serve as valid educational tools for those just starting out with post processing digital image files by looking at what someone who is more experienced did to get to the end result. In that context by all means go for it. For the most part I believe a lot of the preset purveyors are selling a bunch of nothing at too high a price to an uneducated market of people that don&#8217;t know better. To each his own but I have to say this, I really do. I have wrestled with the temptation of selling Nikon color presets because so very very many people have asked me for them. I have tried my best to show people how they can do it but I guess the allure of push button automation vs. a half hour of work is the siren song of the 21st century. Maybe I will break down and do it but I will only do it if I am satisfied that it genuinely provides a value to the people that spend the money - a no excuses product. The commercial products that I have seen for sale that are supposed to do this are laughably bad. Adobe&#8217;s FREE ACR camera profiles are far far better and done the &#8220;right&#8221; way.</p>

<p>Now onto some advice. When organizing your Aperture 3 presets you would do well to organize them - no matter whether you buy them or you make them you may get some milage out of trying to sort them into what adjustment blocks they affect. You don&#8217;t have to do this in a strict fashion, you can still group them logically as well as to what they do. Further more having them organized in what order you may want to apply them can help as well. Sort of &#8220;one-shot&#8221; the works kind of presets vs. additive or &#8220;on top of other adjustments&#8221;</p>

<p>One last note is related to the lack of mechanisms to coordinate presets - In Aperture three there are no incremental presets - in other words you can&#8217;t add something or subtract something from a single adjustment block in a preset - it is replace only, hence the organization comments above. There is a way to sort of work around this for presets that you consider &#8220;incremental&#8221;  or things you might want to put on top of other adjustments. Keep in mind this only works well for presets. Make your &#8220;add-on&#8221; preset in a second duplicate adjustment brick. For example a second enhance brick - or a second curves brick that you add with &#8220;new curves adjustment&#8221; in the little gear menu of the brick. Don&#8217;t do anything to the first brick while making the preset and save both of the bricks in your preset. When you apply the add-on it will undo the first one as well as add the second one but you can now re-apply the first &#8220;overall&#8221; preset without disrupting the add-one. I know it&#8217;s a bit anal but it saves time if you are into this sort of thing and that&#8217;s what presets are all about isn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p>Maybe I will do an article on the presets I actually made myself and how I arranged them if there is any interest. Sorry for the long post but I really did feel the need to &#8220;clear&#8221; the air on presets after the misunderstood &#8220;HDR preset&#8221; post.</p>

<p>Happy Friday.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yep I love Nik software. I guess it comes from being introduced to color control points in Nikon/Nik Capture NX. I find most of their products worthwhile if you have a need for local adjustments, color effects filters, the best black and white conversions, noise reduction, and specialized sharpening. Now Nik has entered the HDR game. As usual the list price is outrageous for a plug-in but knowing Nik if HDR is your &#8220;thing&#8221; their product is probably killer.</p>

<p>As soon as I can get my hands on a copy I will do one of my mini-reviews. As you know i am not an HDR guy but acknowledge that a bunch of photographers out there are, so I thought you might be interested in this. Let&#8217;s hope it will give the other guys a kick in the pants for some better HDR competition out there in HDR land. Here is the <a href="http://www.niksoftware.com/hdrefexpro/usa/entry.php" target="_blank">announcement from Nik</a>. And <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26fsc%3D-1%26ih%3D10_0_1_0_0_0_1_0_0_1.58_134%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3DNik%2520software%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">here is where to get some other their other products</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/faces1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2248" title="faces" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/faces1-300x136.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="136" /></a>Well it may be a day late and a dollar short but the <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2010/08/15/aperture-organization/">Aperture 3 update to the Organization eBook</a> is finally done and ready for download. I wish it didn&#8217;t take me so stinking long. I swear I started it the week after Aperture 3 was release. I wanted to do a good job, I wanted to rephrase some of the things in the old eBook, and I guess I got distracted by numerous other of life&#8217;s little obstacles. After all this is more a labor of love.</p>

<p>I did decide to raise the price like two dollars. After looking at all the other choices available it&#8217;s still unique and the best value out there by a mile - in fact it is still the least expensive and I think one of the better guides out there if I do have to say so myself but I would also love to hear what you have to say as well. I am nothing if not receptive to your input.</p>

<p>Anyway - now it&#8217;s like 22,000 words - holy crap - I try my best to say things succinctly. Here is the new advert page. If you are a prior customer for version 2 you should have received an upgrade offer for the price difference between old and new - yep just 2 bucks. If not - sorry, I sent them to your PayPal email.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/DSC_9534HDR.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2207" title="DSC_9534HDR" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/DSC_9534HDR-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>I thought I would follow up the Nik HDR Efex Pro announcement with a free preset for all of you Aperture 3 people. If you haven&#8217;t been reading for a while you probably don&#8217;t know that I am not a big fan of HDR but I thought that this preset might be a fun way to introduce you to the power and the glory of Aperture&#8217;s Highlights and Shadows adjustment.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2009/01/07/aperture-2-quick-tip-highlights-and-shadows/">Here is an old tutorial on Highlights and Shadows</a>. Let&#8217;s not get into the &#8220;bad HDR&#8221; vs &#8220;good HDR&#8221; because if you have that conversation with someone it will amaze you how all your words agree with each other&#8217;s but when you look at images together there is a 99.9% chance your definition of good and bad HDR will diverge wildly. So&#8230; Here is my over the top impression of what all things labeled as HDR look like - I did say over the top, you can tune it to your own definition of &#8220;good HDR&#8221;. Here is the HDR recipe from my standpoint.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Bring all of the shadows into the midtones.</li>
    <li>Bring all of the Highlights into the midtones.</li>
    <li>So much so that they will actually cross over each other at some point.</li>
    <li>Jank the living hell out of the midtone contrast.</li>
    <li>Make sure there are some large soft halos of sorts that look like surreal light on an alien planet.</li>
</ul>


<p>Okay - so here are some of the results of my trademarked over the top HDR preset for any image. Just make sure that it is a RAW image. These are with no other adjustments - season to taste, you can probably tell before and after. You can download the preset at the bottom.</p>
