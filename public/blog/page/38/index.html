  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/scans.jpg"><img title="scans.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/.thumbs/.scans.jpg" border="0" alt="scans.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="94" align="left" /></a>Well, I have crossed over the threshold. I have received the same question enough that I cannot avoid posting something on the subject. I have been trying to avoid this and skirt it for some time now. Like forever. Truth is that my scanned film does not reside in Aperture. Nope. I would like it to reside there, all neatly cataloged and categorized but alas it just don&#8217;t cut it. Yet.</p>

<p>To be completely truthful - I have tried it. I really really have. I could even live with all my 35mm stuff in Aperture but since a giant portion of my scans are large format and medium format I don&#8217;t bother doing anything different for my 35mm. The reason is simple - Aperture chokes on giant files. I am not going to name the exact size because there is no exact limit. Let it suffice to say that Aperture becomes extremely unstable trying to use it with a project consisting of a bunch of files in the several hundred megabyte range. Confused is a nice way of saying unstable. So I don&#8217;t bother.</p>

<p>I do suspect that Aperture 3 or Aperture X or whatever it is called will be 64bit and probably fix this issue. It won&#8217;t target film users/scanned files as the target market - it will do this because a lot of high end digital backs are approaching the size of my scanned negatives. That and if you chuck a couple of bitmapped layers into the mix in PS the size of even moderately giant MPIX cameras turns into really truely gargantuan. I also suspect the popularity of stitched files and HDR will drive this need as well. Hey maybe Aperture 3 will have that crap built in, who knows.</p>

<p>Now to the nitty gritty. I do use Aperture to catalog my film negatives - I do it with low res JPGs and lots of metadata but the big scans are not actually in the library and I do not use Aperture to tweak them. While we are on the subject, I do find it extremely useful to have a reasonable sample of my film library organized with appropriate metadata in Aperture but I do not have even close to all of my negatives scanned and indexed. I don&#8217;t even have close to my favorites scanned.</p>

<p>I have not published my process for doing this mostly because it would seem completely convoluted to most people. And it is but I do find value there for the short time it takes me to put the JPGs in there. If anybody is interested at all I will post a short description of what I do and more importantly why I do it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/2009_010_17.jpg"><img title="2009_010_17.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/.thumbs/.2009_010_17.jpg" border="0" alt="2009_010_17.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="100" align="left" /></a>Remember when I wrote a post way back about 80% of all photography stuff you read is bullcrap? Whether it be on the web or in print or wherever. I really wasn&#8217;t trying to blast any particular person or photographer - some that will remain nameless deserve it but I really wasn&#8217;t. I believe most photographic bullcrap are lies of omission although some are despicable deception to feed individuals own ego. Like a bunch of numb-nuts spouting the virtues and their apparent god like abilities of using one light and their entire portfolio consists of images made with 4 or 5 lights used in very very obvious ways.</p>

<p>I strive to tell the whole story - sometimes I screw up. If I do I really really want people to call me on it. when something just doesn&#8217;t make sense. The reason for this is that I like to pass on what little wisdom my experiences have brought me in a meaningful and helpful way. If there are things that just don&#8217;t add up they are distractions that get in the way of that goal.</p>

<p>Those distractions as I said are probably unintentional - here is an example. <a href="http://www.joemcnally.com/blog/2009/12/22/kandra-and-one-light/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+joemcnally+%28Joe+McNally%27s+Blog%29">Joe McNally&#8217;s latest post</a>. I do not know Joe, never met him. I am sure he is a standup guy and a wonderful teacher. He probably deserves every bit of the reputation that he has. He is also probably a lot more sophisticated than his down home simple boy persona that he puts on. I just glanced at his latest post and I see a giant distraction in his description of what he is doing vs. the images he has illustrating it. In fact the illustrations are a bit contradictory. I am sure that he did not mean them to be. Â In fact I am sure there is a good explanation even if it is just the point of view that he chose for those illustrations.</p>

<p>I am going to call him on it - just because I would want someone to do it to me. Not in a nasty way, just in a curious searching for clarification way.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. Five points for anyone that sees the same discrepancy that I do - you don&#8217;t even need to read the post.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/2009_0003_1200dpi_7_1.jpg"><img title="2009_0003_1200dpi_7_1.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/.thumbs/.2009_0003_1200dpi_7_1.jpg" border="0" alt="2009_0003_1200dpi_7_1.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="120" align="left" /></a>Been playing with that new (antique) lens doing a lot of test shots of stupid crap in preparation for my brand spanking new epic portrait project. I do a lot of testing and preparation work - also known as a way to rationalize procrastination and feel &#8220;busy&#8221; and &#8220;productive&#8221;. At the end of the day I would be just as busy and way more productive if I did my crappy test shots of the subject of my actual project. Maybe I will try that someday. Is there really a big difference wasting time with testing things vs. wasting time testing with the actual subject of a project? You will figure out the same things but there is a chance that you will actually make some work that you wanted to make even if by accident. Some how there is a psychological advantage to screwing up shots of crappy stupid stuff than screwing up shots of your actual project.</p>

<p>Moving on - In addition to my procrastination obstacle I am facing a couple of real obstacles that I need to deal with. My new lens has the rendering that I want - not to harsh and not soft focus either. Perfect. What is not perfect is that the longer shutter speeds on this old beast are nowhere near accurate - worse yet they are random. Sometimes 1/2 second other times they are 2 seconds. Hmmm - got deal with that. Worse yet there is no flash sync so I will have to figure that out as well. If I go with holding the shutter open and popping the flash I may need two different films - not my intention. If I go with all natural light I have the shutter speed thing to deal with. Don&#8217;t worry I will figure it out, even if I have to tape an Ilex syncro #5 to the front of it. On top of all that this thing flares like crazy in high key lighting scenes.</p>

<p>Why am I going through this trouble? Easy - because large format 8x10 has a &#8220;look&#8221; and contact prints have a &#8220;look&#8221; that is unique and oh so wonderful. The quality even from substandard crappy equipment has it&#8217;s own look and is really hard to duplicate with anything else. Take the image at the top of the post - even at web size I can tell it&#8217;s large format from a mile away and that is only 4x5 scanned at 1200dpi on my crappy flatbed<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/2009_0003_1200dpi_full.jpg"><img title="2009_0003_1200dpi_full.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/.thumbs/.2009_0003_1200dpi_full.jpg" border="0" alt="2009_0003_1200dpi_full.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" align="right" /></a>scanner. As you probably know there is a ton more detail in the film and that detail in a contact print means tones that are spectacular. Heck here is a &#8220;100%&#8221; view, well not really 100% but about 12x magnification (the equivalent of a 5 foot wide print from this tiny little 4x5) Even with a crappy out of focus scan (the dust isn&#8217;t even sharp) you can get an idea of what sheet film does. Oh - this hasen&#8217;t been sharpened digitally either - a matter of course for scans because of their inherent blurriness. Just like AA filters on digital only worse.</p>

<p>Wish me luck - anyone have a good shutter they want to part with?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/2009_008_03_flat_rgb_1.jpg"><img title="2009_008_03_flat_rgb_1.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/.thumbs/.2009_008_03_flat_rgb_1.jpg" border="0" alt="2009_008_03_flat_rgb_1.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" align="left" /></a>I posted a brief note on my follies searching for an 8x10 sheet film that was &#8220;cheaper&#8221; than my favorites from Kodak. I was testing Efke R100/PL100 due to the fact that I can get it for about half what I pay for Kodak. I started with the 120 R100 and also have a small box of 50 sheets of 4x5 PL100. I was not going to shell out $100 just to test.Â So here is what I have found.</p>

<p>The Efke 100 is workable but I am not going to use it. I am sticking with Kodak. For the most part because I like the Yellow boxes and I do not want them to go away. Not only do I not want them to go away, I want them to bring back some emulsions in 8x10 that are no longer available. The other reasons are that the Efke has no where near the overall quality of the Kodak. Sure it works. Sure if it were the only thing available I would use it with no real &#8220;issues&#8221;. The 120 film is so cheap an curly I cannot stand it. The paper backing is ill fitting. The PL base is not as bad but it is still more fragile than the Kodak and easier to accidentally destroy if you bump it against anything while processing it.</p>

<p>The reality is that I love the Kodak stuff. I love TRI-X in both the 400 and 320 versions - two completely different and wonderful films. I love PLUS-X in 120. I love TMAX 100 TMX in all it&#8217;s formats. TMAX 400 TMY 2 in its latest version I am not sure about yet. PLUS-X in sheet film is gone - for a while now. I cannot let that happen to TRI-X TXP through my own purchasing decisions.</p>

<p>I am not saying that Fuji or Ilford film is not any good - it is fantastic and of the same calibre as Kodak. I just like some of the Kodak film better. What I am saying is that if you shoot film I urge you to put your purchasing dollars into one of these top tier companies. The last thing that we film shooters want is for these pillars of film technology and quality manufacturing to cease doing what they are doing. I personally do not want to be in a world without TRI-X, HP 5, FP 4, TMAX 100, PLUS-X, Neopan 400, etc. I do not want to be at the mercy of boutique manufacturers whose products are over priced and/or do not stand up to the standards set by the giants. Nor do I want to be stuck with substandard second tier mass producers that produce okay but not superlative products.</p>

<p>For my upcoming 8x10 film project I am sticking with Kodak. Yea it is going to cost me $5 a sheet but I rather have TRI-X.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. Note that Kodak was the ONLY film vendor at the last PhotoExpo. People tell me that the line at their display was pretty long. I guess that is good.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/2001_034_04.jpg"><img title="2001_034_04.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/.thumbs/.2001_034_04.jpg" border="0" alt="2001_034_04.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="left" /></a>I had a reader ask me a question about film development. Specifically what my development times were for a particular film/developer combination. The reason he asked was he &#8220;liked&#8221; the way one of my images looked but he had issues with a development time/temp he got from &#8220;The Massive Development Chart&#8221;.</p>

<p>Hmmmm&#8230;. well that depends on a lot of things. The most gigantic thing is YOU and YOUR process and how tight YOUR controls are and&#8230; To a much much lesser extent it has to do with water quality. Take one look at the massive development chart with virtually any film and developer combination and you can probably tell that it is a useless resource. Heck the times given for the same film shot at the same speed with NOTES that describe the same procedure vary so wildly it is not even funny. Sometimes processes claiming to be the same in terms of method/dilution/agitation give the time and temp that differ by 100%. That is why this resource is almost useless.</p>

<p>That is also why I don&#8217;t publish specific development times. Kodak does, Ilford does, and if you follow their recommend processing guidelines to the letter and your process has reasonably tight controls you will be in the ballpark of reproducing the exact contrast index that they were targeting - if that is what you really want. So what to do if those recommendations don&#8217;t cover what you need? Try anything based on a guess from previous experience, film type, general developer activity, whatever and modify what you did from that point. It&#8217;s not brain surgery - really. I can almost assure you you can get it to &#8220;what you were looking for&#8221; inside 3 or 4 tries and know a heck of a lot more about what you want under what conditions even from your total failures than you will ever learn from the massive development chart.</p>

<p>So say you have some degree of consistency down and your hard won knowledge of one film in one developer buy either want to use another film or need to use another film. What do you do then? Guess! yep just guess. You will probably get close if you have some rationale - every once in a while you will get a nasty surprise but you will probably get where you want to get on the next try. I am going to do something that I almost never ever do and list some specifics for films that I know well assuming you want to print on a modern VC paper at grade 2. I am not going to list times, I am going to give some relationships that I have found for &#8220;normal&#8221; development that I have found to be true for films that I have used for a long long time in a wide variety of developer formulations. All of them are Kodak. I could give similar relationships for other brands but I am not confident that they will hold true over a wide variety of conditions - they probably would based on my more limited experience and that is where I would start my guesses at but I am only going to list things that I am certain of.</p>

<p>Kodak TMAX 100 (TMX) takes about the same time/temp in a given development process as Kodak TRI-X 400 does. No kidding. TMX changes more quickly one way or another but normal is about the same time.</p>

<p>Kodak TRI-X 320 (TXP) takes a lot longer than Kodak TRI-X 400 (10%-35%) more time depending on developer.</p>

<p>Kodak PLUS-X (PX and PXP) take much shorter times than Kodak TMX (20-25%)</p>

<p>I have a lot of other data like this but these things are true over a ton of different developers I have used. I hope this is useful at all to the 5 people still shooting and processing their own film. Your milage may vary from my exact times but I do not believe the relationships I have listed will.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/2009_0001_1200dpi.jpg"><img title="2009_0001_1200dpi.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/.thumbs/.2009_0001_1200dpi.jpg" border="0" alt="2009_0001_1200dpi.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="120" height="150" align="left" /></a>Yea, I know that my test shots are boring and stupid but look beyond that for a second. I got this thing today and could not wait to see what it looked like on film. My new lens is a 13 inch triple convertible Wollensak Velostigmat with a Compur shutter from the 1930&#8217;s. Actually it is 3 lenses a 20 inch, a 13 inch, and a 25 inch depending on how you screw it together. It&#8217;s uncoated and just what I wanted. Nobody was around and I didn&#8217;t want to wait so I just grabbed the first think near me and shot wide open at all of f6.3.</p>

<p>I happen to shoot this on 4x5 Efke PL100 in my 8x10 camera. Heck the stuff is downright cheap compared to my beloved Kodak 8x10 film that is like $5 sheet. Snapped the picture and went strait to the darkroom to process this in a tray with Pyrocat HD. Not too bad for a crappy Microtek scan huh?</p>

<p>So why did I want this lens? Because some of my Schneiders and Nikkors that cover 8x10 are too too too sharp for a project that I am planning to start very soon - my ever delayed all 8x10 portrait project - I am going to actually make contact prints as the final output. I have one more thing to do before I start - I am negotiating a price for another really old lens that is even softer than this one with a larger aperture. I want to do the whole project with the same lens and Â same materials throughout. This is my way of procrastinating things that I know are big big jobs but there is only one item left. If I don&#8217;t get the price I want to pay, this one will do fine.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. What is the very first thing that you shoot when you get a new lens. You know you shoot stupid crap to. Admit it already and don&#8217;t even say you wait to fire off the first shot.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/autostack.jpg"><img title="autostack.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/.thumbs/.autostack.jpg" border="0" alt="autostack.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="94" align="left" /></a>Autostack is probably one of the least used features but one that can save you an immense amount of time. If you happen to shoot digital and have the image capture date embedded in all your images for you autostack is an extremely precise tool that you can use at the beginning of your workflow.</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t really matter if you shoot sports, portraits, fashion or landscapes. Unless you are very very different from the rest of us human beings your shots of the same subject with the same lighting, framing, and perspective will usually fall within a short time period with a gap before you change your framing, lighting, subject, etc. Autostack stacks and unstacks images based on the time between images and&#8230; You can see it visually. This is fantastic and far easier than doing it manually. The big win here is when you use stack mode to review your images and get to the best ones very quickly.</p>

<p>Understanding why autostack is so great requires you to understand why albums are great to bubble various edits/versions/post production treatments up to the top as well. The other thing that might help are a couple of tips from me because I am an autostack/stack mode junkie. The trick is to go a little overboard with the autostack. In most cases that I have experienced you end up with everything falling neatly into really close times if they are different shots/framing/etc. with one or two that are very different that get picked up and jammed into a stack that you really don&#8217;t want in a stack. Like when you do a really really quick change in framing or composition and go back to the same one you were using before - etc. If you are too OCD with using autostack not wanting anything to be stacked &#8220;wrong&#8221; you end up with not nearly enough photos that belong in the same stack actually autostacked. It is far better to go a little more aggressive an end up with an image here or there in the wrong stack. or more likely a couple stacks that are really big with two different subjects/compositions in them.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that it is much quicker to get things out of a stack than it is to put them together using just the keyboard. Most of the time what will happen when you use autostack to it&#8217;s full advantage is you end up with two subjects in one stack - this is even easier to deal with while using just the keyboard. The magic keyboard short cuts correspond to &#8220;Extract Item&#8221; and &#8220;Split stack&#8221; under the stack menu. Look them up in the menu.</p>

<p>Learning to use autostack, a couple of keyboard shortcuts, and stack mode took my process to get to my selects down from hours to minutes for my commercial work. I found once it was so painless I actually had time and desire to do it a couple times and guess what - I made better decisions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/2000_034_15.jpg"><img title="2000_034_15.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/.thumbs/.2000_034_15.jpg" border="0" alt="2000_034_15.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="left" /></a>Yikes, family portraits scare me. They really really do. Every year at this time of year various family members, friends, and neighbors ask me to do their family portraits. Hey you take pictures don&#8217;t you? You have a really nice camera. Would you mind doing a family portrait of us. Hey what can I say? Sure&#8230; No problem.</p>

<p>I really don&#8217;t mind, in fact I enjoy it. The problem is I hate most of the &#8220;professional&#8221; portraits that I see on greeting cards, laying around peoples houses, etc. They aren&#8217;t mug shots - they are line ups. The lighting is okay - I guess. The problem is that these people are not professional models, their kids are not professional models, and they are all stiff and staring into the camera. I hate to put my name on those - I really do. So here is how I survive.</p>

<p>I take those kinds of pictures because that&#8217;s what &#8220;normal&#8221; people want - strait forward - stare strait ahead and look very unnatural. That is usually not the pictures they see of my kids but it is what they want for their holiday portrait - there is some strange expectation that somehow I will magically make the family lineup more like my unposed pictures. The same but like we get at the Walmart. While doing the pictures that they expect I will also do ones that I can tolerate.</p>

<p>Without fail they &#8220;like&#8221; the ones that were my way better - the laugh and think they are wonderful but end up printing the lineup face forward stiff stuff on their christmas cards. Take the shots they think they need - then take the shots you want. I predict that within a couple of years they will be begging you for the other ones that they didn&#8217;t put on the card. Well at least you will like them better.</p>

<p>Here are some tips: If you have more than one person in a shot having everyone look at the camera usually turns out bad - have them interact with each other. Some interactions work with one of them looking at the camera but not the other ones. Trust me - try it. I can count on one hand the number of family portraits that I have seen where everyone is looking at the camera that were any good. Shoot first ask questions later - if you see something that is great hit the button - do not worry too much about focus, etc. Do it even if your flashes are not ready. Every once in a while it will be flawed but fabulous. Sometimes the flaws will actually add to the fabulous - other times it will not matter. Your job is to get them as they actually are in an appealing way.</p>

<p>Make your lighting really really simple if it is more than one person - it needs to be fool proof. These people are not pro&#8217;s and if you are worried more about shadow placement and angle you will miss the moment. Well, I am off to do a dad/daughter of my old neighbor - I will let you know how it turned out.</p>

<p>Here is one I did last week of nieces: This is not the final Â just an example of hit the<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/GS0054.jpg"><img title="GS0054.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/.thumbs/.GS0054.jpg" border="0" alt="GS0054.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="100" align="right" /></a>buttonÂ anyway - even the ones that have all kind of flaws can be worthwhile. My light was not recycled yet on this one and the motion was really really fast so I have a lot of motion blur buy who cares.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s that time again, time for my not so regular rant on Photography&#8217;s state of the union. Well maybe not rant but search for understanding. My inspiration was a fellow photographer that I met wielding s brand spanking new state of the art 20 some megapixel DSLR. It wasn&#8217;t his first DSLR. Some really nice glass to. I actually had an M6 with me but it was inside a small bag.</p>

<p>We got to discussing photography and as you would expect and guess what. This guy doesn&#8217;t make prints - really. Well he does on the rare occasion but that is only once in a while and when he does they are 8 inches-ish wide. No crap, I can&#8217;t make this stuff up. Now I can see that if you are a working PJ and somebody else consumes your stuff and prints it why you would use a pro calibre high Mpix DSLR with big glass, even if you didn&#8217;t print personally. So let&#8217;s count those people out.</p>

<p>The vast majority of image consumption if you measure all images and all consumption is heading towards the web. Let&#8217;s even narrow that down to journalism and commercial advertising - we hear this every day. The trend is away from printed media. Let&#8217;s flip flop that and go with the consumer side of the equations. Not much printing that I can tell if my little circle of non-photographer friends and family are an indicator. They all love those little LCD picture frames and blazing through their images on the computer screen and then emailing a really small (700px on the long end) image to their friends or posting said image on the web in a few different ways.</p>

<p>So here is the question - why the hell is everyone so freaking obsessed with new better higher resolution cameras. Why Â - I really really do not get it. I don&#8217;t get it. Please explain this to me. I am confounded by what seems to be completely illogical. Publish material about how to make better pictures (as in take them, not post process them into brash bold shocking trash) and nobody cares. Publish material on the latest greatest digital camera release - everyone that has no need has to know. I guess it is the same reason that everyone gives a crap about Tiger Woods and what he does with his personal life and I have no idea why.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yep, another ebook. So soon? Hey I have been working on these for a long time. This eBook covers Aperture organization. There is a good chance that if you are reading this that you may already have the free Aperture Organization PDF that I have made available for about the last year. If so I am not trying to convince you to purchase this one.</p>

<p>I have refined and expanded the coverage of some of the things that I covered in the free version but by no means is there any earth shattering new things. I have added a couple of things and change the way I have presented a few as well. I added some example material that I have been making notes of from people that have given me feedback or had additional questions but this is by no means Â a whole new ball game.</p>

<p>If you have the old one and enjoyed it and feel like sending a couple of bucks my way. Great, it is always appreciated. If you don&#8217;t that is fine as well, hold on to your first version - it is a collectors item. Decoded that means please do not distribute the old version, it is no longer available. If you don&#8217;t have the old one or are dying to see what I added you will probably enjoy the new one. I don&#8217;t want to do so much patting myself on the back just because I put a lot of work into it but I can say that every piece of feedback that I have received on the old version was overwhelmingly positive. Almost 10,000 downloads of the old version, hundreds of emails from fans. In fact that is what motivated me to expand it and cover some other Aperture topics in the eBook format as well. Promises of first born children and such. The new one is better.</p>

<p>Okay what kind of stuff did I add - mostly just tidbits. Like how to deal with the issue that &#8220;edit with&#8230;&#8221; doesn&#8217;t make the new version the album pick. Things like that. Stuff that I thought was obvious in the first version that was apparently not so obvious. Maybe I added a few more work-flow type things.</p>

<p>Seriously if you understood everything I wrote on organization on this site you don&#8217;t need it. If you want some of it explained a little differently and all put together in one spot it might be what you are looking for. If you don&#8217;t have the old Aperture Organization Guide - You need this!</p>
