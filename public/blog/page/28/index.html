  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/2000009_08_Nuetral.jpg"><img title="2000009_08_Nuetral.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/.thumbs/.2000009_08_Nuetral.jpg" border="0" alt="2000009_08_Nuetral.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="100" align="left" /></a>You probably know this but in case you didn&#8217;t I used to love some of the old Agfa black and white papers. Really love them. They were unique and some images just lent themselves to these unique papers. I recently tried the new Adox MCC and it is dead on Agfa MCC with one exception - the base is bayarta - bright white vs natural. The emulsion color seems identical so does the surface of the glossy. I even like it better for some prints. That is why I started selling the sample prints in the first place.</p>

<p>By popular demand - actually just a few people I have decided to expand the number of papers I am offering as sample prints. I am adding a couple today and will add a couple over the next few weeks.</p>

<p>The first is a really really nice paper that is so much like Agfa 118 it is not funny. In every way - emulsion - base color -surface color - every way. It is Foma FB Variant IV 123 Velvet Semi-Matte - that is a mouthful - neutral base - not bright bright white with an emulsion tone similar to the MCC Adox. The surface combined with the subtle colors is what makes this paper very special. Great stuff.</p>

<p>The second paper is a super warmtone - very very very different. Foma FB Cream Base Warmtone Matte - really cool.</p>

<p>They are available now with the same image selection as before. Over the next few days I will be adding some additional images of subject matter that has been requested - still life - landscape - architecture that I think will print well on the papers that I am offering as samples - when they are available I will be introducing another two papers as well, I am just fine tuning the image selection to fit across all three.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/black-and-white-sample-prints/">Hope you enjoy them</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/DSC_1037___Version_2.jpg"><img title="DSC_1037___Version_2.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/.thumbs/.DSC_1037___Version_2.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_1037___Version_2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="101" align="left" /></a>This has to be the best condition, least used, camera I have ever seen that was not bought and hoarded by a &#8220;collector&#8221;. Â This is a Nikon FM, not an FM2 which means that it was made between 1977 and 1982. That is really old and this is a black paint version - yep that is black paint over brass - not plastic and not anodized. Typically cameras that have had more than a couple rolls of film through them and actually shot have &#8220;brassing&#8221; this one has NONE. Unbelievable. Regular FM&#8217;s in black are a whole lot fewer than chrome - black examples this clean are ultra rare.</p>

<p>I got this one with the lens shown for $70 including shipping! The film rails, pressure place and all of the internals are pristine - the viewfinder is cleaner than my D3- no crap. I wish I had the facilities to take a picture so you could see. Think daughter No. 1 will like it? I hope so I am giving it to her tomorrow with an old tripod, a couple of rolls of TRI-X, PLUS-X, and maybe that Vivatar 17-28 that I got for free. I figured she might considering how much fun she is having with that Fuji Instax she bought a couple of weeks ago - that and she asked me to teach her to make black and white prints.</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with the FM - think Pentax K1000 only better typical Nikon build quality and ruggedness. The really cool thing that the FM can do is mount Non-AI lenses - the FM2 cannot.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A little humor for today so please take this as it is intended - a light hearted comment on human nature, mine include. So&#8230; as many of you know I try to participate on the Apple Support Forum for Aperture. I am not one of those people that signed up there the very first day I started using Apple products. I signed up specifically to ask a question to other users since my pro-care support contact (the old really good pro-care - not the new one that is worthless) had not a freaking clue on a problem I was having using Aperture way back in the day when I was shooting commercial work. Long story short - I stuck around because it became apparent that there were not a lot of people that used the crap out of Aperture like I did. I figured I would help if I could - hence this website a few years ago.</p>

<p>My usual M.O. is to surf the first page of the forum and see if there are unanswered stuff that I can point people in the right direction. There are certain subjects I shy away from because I am sick of typing the same sentence over and over and it is simple and will get answered in about 5 mins anyway. I do this while I am at my computer waiting on &#8220;stuff&#8221; and have time.</p>

<p>Lately - after the Aperture 3 release I find myself surfing Aperture forum less and less - more like every few days. Why? The chaos of all the new users and the idiotic questions and all of the idiotic answers that go along with it. A total mishmash of wrong questions, wrong answers, irrelevant discussion - chaos. To much stress. The really not so funny - funny part is when a bunch of people asking and answering exactly wrong come to agreement that wrong = right. So I shoot over there every couple of days.</p>

<p>The punch line - there are a few voices of reason over there - I do not know how they do it. Matthew B. is one of them. What struck me as funny today was one of the usuals posting the topic &#8220;please watch the tutorials before posting&#8221; Haaahaahaa haahahaha.</p>

<p>Funny stuff - and I thought I was the only one smacking my forehead while my eyes rolled into the back of my head. The good news is it seems like Aperture 3 has a market.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. If you are in the right mood the funniest shit is posted by the Lightroom experts who are now Aperture experts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/2000_022_23.jpg"><img title="2000_022_23.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/.thumbs/.2000_022_23.jpg" border="0" alt="2000_022_23.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="120" height="150" align="left" /></a>My crazy little experiment in providing samples of Adox MCC 110 has been successful. We&#8217;ll it has been successful for my definition of accomplishing what I wanted to do - give people the opportunity to see real black and white paper in their own hands for cheap. My other definition of successful was that I could actually handle fulfilling the orders in the context of my own printing sessions. So far so good but I have been getting some questions about the sample prints - one of which I will address with and answer and the others I will address with a change to the sample print choices.</p>

<p>First off - I wanted to clarify some things I wrote in <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2010/01/09/adox-mcc-110-what-does-a-sample-print-look-like/">this post</a> that I have received a few emails about. The difference in print exposure for the two scans shown was about 1/2 stop of print exposure on grade 2.5 paper. Yes print exposures of 1/2 stop make a huge difference - it get&#8217;s bigger as you up the contrast. Part B of the question was related to &#8220;contrast&#8221; - the scans are raw scans strait off my really crappy flatbed scanner of the two under and over prints with NO contrast adjustment so they look a bit flat on your screen - visually in person the blacks are black - not grey. I did not want to monkey with them so I didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Now for the real news - I have received lots of special image requests and so far have accommodated them as best I could but&#8230; that takes a lot of time for me if I have not printed the negative on that paper before - it also causes some waste that I was not planning on. The biggest request was not for a particular image it was for a particular kind of image - namely something very wall-arty - my words. Specifically landscape-y, still life-y, architecture-y, etc. So&#8230; I am going to add a few negatives to the selection that hopefully meet that criteria.</p>

<p>The other thing I am going to do is add a few more papers that I have been experimenting with to the selection. The papers for now will be pretty much a good selection of the Foma fiber based papers with various warn/neutral/white bases and a couple of surfaces. These are really nice and again are so similar to a lot of the old Agfa papers that it is unbelievable. Really nice stuff. Price will be about the same - namely a great deal since Â it covers materials and shipping and that is about it. I think you will be very happy with them if this kind of thing is up your ally. Any body who has them feel free to chime in.</p>

<p>On another front - Some of you know that Kodak announced the discontinuance of TRI-X TXP in 120 and 220 only. This is not a huge deal but a bit of a pain in the ass for some of us. I used to shoot it occasionally in 120 - not my main film but it was kind of nice when I shot medium format along with TXP in large format because the exposure and curve was so similar (not exactly but very close). So I could go with one set of meter readings and exposure notes for both formats. I still shoot TXP in large format as that is not discontinued and reports are that it sells very well but am pretty much done in 120.</p>

<p>I for one will not be stock piling TXP in 120 - a lot of source are already out - that is amazing. I do not feel like the storage headache. The fridge is not the issue - background radiation is so&#8230; if you are stockpiling don&#8217;t forget your lead lined bags. I do think it is a shame that Kodak cannot justify production of TXP in 120 and now that the 220 is gone there is NO MORE 220 at all in black and white. Call it the end of an era. RIP.</p>

<p>Now for the good news - the Kodak EKTAR 100 is about the most amazing stuff you ever shot. New last year and more formats this year - 35mm, medium format 120, 4x5, and 8x10. Wow. If you shoot color give it a try - I think you will be amazed - no wonder Hollywood likes this stuff so much (that is who the original emulsion was developed for - it is called Vision or something). Honestly you could probably shoot this instead of slides if you shoot landscape-y stuff. The cool thing is that the color is really punch but it still renders great skin tones.</p>

<p>If you were missing Kodak HIE - check out the sorta new Efke IR820 - Freestyle has it and here is the kicker - it now has NO ANTI HALATION LAYER - so the look is dead on for HIE. You can also do things you never could do before with the long gone Kodak HIE - not only 35mm but medium and large format as well. I tried the 35mm and it looks just like HIE - looks like I will be buying some bigger film to.</p>

<p>Ps. Top image - grab shot of daughter No. 3 in an unusual state. Note the lollipop grip - that is normal for her, god knows what possessed her to hold lollipops and popsicles by the wrong end but she did - always.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/2010_0002_700.jpg"><img title="2010_0002_700.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/.thumbs/.2010_0002_700.jpg" border="0" alt="2010_0002_700.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="120" height="150" align="left" /></a>Here is what happens when I get frustrated in the dark - those marks on the top of the frame are fingernail marks from me saying &#8220;F THIS&#8221; Â after 10 minutes of screwing around with a 4x5 film holder that I thought I had &#8220;fixed&#8221; a year ago. No big deal it was just me screwing around with negatives for a new print process I am experimenting with. Since I had five other negatives I was developing at the same time I just chucked it in with the rest.</p>

<p>I thought that some of you out there that think everyone but you is perfect might get a laugh out of this. Go ahead - after my fit of rage I get over it real quick and never take myself too seriously. Life is too short. The other thing I thought you might find amusing was a guy with so obviously little patience shoots large format - ha ha. People sometimes mistake my obsessiveness for patience - they are two very very different characteristics that have a tiny bit of overlap. Even you digital only people should find this amusing - in a different way.</p>

<p>So - why do I shoot large format then? It looks different. The tonality is unique. I can use beat up lenses with no coatings and are in the process of separating from the 1920&#8217;s - with strange designs and stranger aberrations that also provide a very unique rendering. Take a<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/2010_0002_crop.jpg"><img title="2010_0002_crop.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/.thumbs/.2010_0002_crop.jpg" border="0" alt="2010_0002_crop.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="188" align="right" /></a> look at this crop. The print from this would be about 4 feet high. This is also the grainiest film I shoot - really - it does not get much grainier than this in this developer. This film is even grainier than TRI-X (which is not really a grainy film contrary to popular urban legend - at least it has not been for decades).</p>

<p>Enjoy - The joke is on me.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps - My P-O-S flatbed does no justice to large format - I print this stuff on real paper - sometimes paper I coat myself with platinum or other odd do-it-yourself processes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/2010_003_36.jpg"><img title="2010_003_36.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/.thumbs/.2010_003_36.jpg" border="0" alt="2010_003_36.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="left" /></a>Well that Nikon FM2 that came the other day works great. The meter agrees 100% with my D3 center-weighted meter at the same ISO. I also shot it against a known good quantity (my electronically controlled Nikon F100) with the same film and same development and guess what - the rolls are identical from an exposure stand point. It is a keeper.</p>

<p>A couple of people sent me emails and asked if I was serious about shooting 35mm film - they sort of get the 120 and sheet film but they were asking 35mm - really? Yep really. It is not nearly as flexible as digital the film you have in the camera dictates the aesthetic and to some degree the technical &#8220;quality&#8221;. That you are stuck with for 36 images - so what. I have no qualms shooting a couple of extra frames to &#8220;finish&#8221; I still shoot way less than I shoot with digital. I also have no qualms to just rewind half way into a roll and be done if the circumstances dictate. In reality I am not in situations that call for ISO 400 then ISO 1600 then ISO 100 within 36 frames. If you shoot 4 images and put the camera away until next week and then another 7 images and put the camera away until Christmas - well the circumstance are likely to change.</p>

<p>I also have no need for color/quality/black and white choices after the fact. I actually like my options limited - I decide what and how I am going to approach something and I am done. I don&#8217;t keep second guessing the infinite options AFTER I shot it. I shoot very differently when I shoot black and white and know I am shooting black and white. I shoot very differently when I shoot color - I look at completely different things. Yes there is some overlap but for the most part&#8230;</p>

<p>Last but not least - I am way beyond the need to make every image I ever shoot the most technically &#8220;good&#8221; image that is possible in my photographic journey. I do not mount my camera on a tripod for every image - I do not use the absolute best lens for every photo - I do not use the highest resolution finest grain film or camera setting and I certainly don&#8217;t try to make it look like I did with noise reduction, sharpening, etc. Sometimes this is critical for the image that you are making but in most cases for the subject matter I shoot - it is way way down the list. In fact some images lend themselves to some subject movement, etc, etc.</p>

<p>Last but not least I love black and white and I love prints on paper. Film is way way way way less expensive to make not only decent but in a lot of ways aesthetically superior black and white prints with an infinitely grater range of treatment options for the final look. How much cheaper - less than half the cost - way less. If you are a black and white output guy - forget the film cost it doesn&#8217;t even count. Let&#8217;s take two really really good papers - a very nice glossy FB 11x14 silver black and white paper that I use regularly and Museo Silver Rag - a really nice Inkjet paper that I like. The real photo paper - bayarta coated (this is a black and white photo paper invention even though the new fad is to call a bunch of inkjet papers the same thing - it is not some new technology) - with real SILVER in the emulsion. Twenty Five sheets = $39. Museo Silver RAG - $89 from Amazon. Yea yea the Museo is slightly bigger but let&#8217;s talk ink shall we. The paper developer is dirt cheap $6 for at least 4 boxes of the silver paper - more if you print a lot but I never exhaust a tray of developer Â in a session and never save it.</p>

<p>The sprint flowers at the top of the post were just a random frame from crap laying around that I shot and developed for the test roll on the FM2 yesterday - 10 year old Tri-X shot at 1600 developed using a stand process in very dilute HC110. Pretty cool.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most of you may be through the Aperture 2 to Aperture 3 conversion but for anybody still waiting or still facing difficulties here are a couple observations and some hypothesis regarding one of the big bugaboos - Endless Processing after conversion that hangs up other things you want to do behind it.</p>

<p>I was participating in a conversation over on the Apple support forums regarding something completely different and based on input from a few different folks ONE of the things that seems is the likely culprit at the root of Aperture 3&#8217;s woes that causes this is a combination of file size and the retouch tool. That is to say - smaller files with a large amount of retouch points or large files with a limited number. After correlating this to my experience and observations it looks like this is absolutely a factor. Some folks are even having issues associated with this after the conversion was beaten into submission with new files.</p>

<p>Maybe one of the reasons my own library went so so smoothly is that I have no files that use the retouch/healing tool. None. All of the advice out there to make the conversion go as smoothy as possible is still a good idea and you may want to consider removing the retouch/healing brush from your images prior to conversion if it sounds like your images are in a high risk category.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/DSC_1019___Version_2.jpg"><img title="DSC_1019___Version_2.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/.thumbs/.DSC_1019___Version_2.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_1019___Version_2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="100" align="left" /></a>Actually I should call this eBay lessons or something. You probably know by now I am a habitual eBay surfer. Â I watch like a gillion items a month and buy about 1 thing every two months or so. I always buy really low risk stuff - return policy - etc. Never any high dollar stuff and I limit the stuff I even look at, well, at least even intend to maybe buy to things that are cool and nice but&#8230; Nobody pays a lot of attention to - no &#8220;collector&#8221; stuff. No stuff that EVERYONE wants. I limit myself to things that are &#8220;like&#8221; what everyone wants but more common.</p>

<p>Here is a perfect example - Nikon FM2 cameras are extremely plentiful on eBay they come and go very quickly. Hundreds of them at any given time. the market for them is soft - as is the same for 99% of all film cameras that anyone would actually use. You can plan on<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/DSC_1007___Version_2.jpg"><img title="DSC_1007___Version_2.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/.thumbs/.DSC_1007___Version_2.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_1007___Version_2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="100" align="right" /></a>grabbing a good example for about 200 bucks some go higher - a lot higher - some go lower.<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/DSC_1009___Version_2.jpg"><img title="DSC_1009___Version_2.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/.thumbs/.DSC_1009___Version_2.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_1009___Version_2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="100" align="left" /></a> Black examples which are also plentiful go for a couple bucks more - like $20 bucks. Most of these cameras have been used - even if they are really ugly they probably work well. How much did I get mine for? Ready&#8230;. Sit down&#8230;. $100, actually $109 plus $12 insured tracked USPS shipping.</p>

<p>Why? Timing for one but more importantly - crappy description and crappy eBay photography that made it look like every other FM2 but worse. The description was a typical bullshit - &#8220;This is not mine, I am selling it for a friend&#8230;&#8221; blah blah blah that made you think<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/DSC_1015___Version_2.jpg"><img title="DSC_1015___Version_2.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/.thumbs/.DSC_1015___Version_2.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_1015___Version_2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="100" align="right" /></a> this guy was weaseling about something - it said nothing about the camera condition and most of the description was about the Vivitar wide angle zoom lens that was sort of broken but worked fine (missing rubber focus grip). Even though the photography was some of the worst point and shoot on camera flash ultra distorted badly exposed full of hotspots awful stuff I have ever seen in a tiny tiny thumbnail size - I used the bad photography to my advantage - I could see that a couple of the areas of FM/FE/FM2 type cameras that are normally worn were in fantastic shape - the paint around the hinge of the film back is typically chipped - just from open and closing the back. Not a big deal all of <a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/DSC_1016___Version_2.jpg"><img title="DSC_1016___Version_2.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/.thumbs/.DSC_1016___Version_2.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_1016___Version_2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="100" align="left" /></a>them are like that - this one wasn&#8217;t. That was about all I could tell from the truly off putting ugliness of the photos. So&#8230; I watched and with 5 minutes left it was only at $55 so I put in a bid that I would be willing to pay - not $56 but $150 - even if it was a working beater it was worth that you can turn them around all day for $150 with decent pictures and description, probably more. But hey I actually use these things (I have like 3 of them one of which I bought new the other two are eBay specials).</p>

<p>Would you buy this for $100? I swear this is the cleanest FM2 I have ever seen that has actually been used - at all. Camera store demos look worse than this. The photos you see are<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/DSC_1017___Version_2.jpg"><img title="DSC_1017___Version_2.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/.thumbs/.DSC_1017___Version_2.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_1017___Version_2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="101" align="right" /></a> un-retouched - strait D200 JPEG files resized in Aperture 3. No shit. You want to see them at 100% - just ask. I wanted you to see what I see. The yellow film box lid is mine - I loaded it up with film and am going to burn and develop a roll <a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/DSC_1018___Version_2.jpg"><img title="DSC_1018___Version_2.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/.thumbs/.DSC_1018___Version_2.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_1018___Version_2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="100" align="left" /></a>tomorrow. If I see another one like this for anywhere near this price or even the price I entered as my maximum bid I will buy it in a heartbeat - yes that will mean I will have 4 of them. Who cares at this price - I will give them away as gifts at one of my workshops or something.</p>

<p>As for the photos - I didn&#8217;t even dust it or my lens off I just set up an SB-800 bounced Â off the wall and ceiling so I was getting the light from a 45 and strong fill from the top. I used my<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/DSC_1022___Version_2.jpg"><img title="DSC_1022___Version_2.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/.thumbs/.DSC_1022___Version_2.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_1022___Version_2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="101" align="right" /></a>leather char and it&#8217;s arms as a backdrop and sort of black cards on the sides so not only for decent lighting but so you <a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/DSC_1020___Version_2.jpg"><img title="DSC_1020___Version_2.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/.thumbs/.DSC_1020___Version_2.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_1020___Version_2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="101" align="left" /></a>couldn&#8217;t see the hideous mess of a man-cave I spend time in.</p>

<p>Here is the really funny thing - load this thing up with Velvia and it will take fantastic images that will give you D3x quality - or better. Do what I do and chuck some B+W TRI-X in there and it will give you fantastic images - the hell with the grain.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/2000_031_10.jpg"><img title="2000_031_10.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/.thumbs/.2000_031_10.jpg" border="0" alt="2000_031_10.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="left" /></a>Just wanted to let everyone know what is going in my world. After a couple of days the latest Aperture update is proving to be much more stable. I have not had it crash once since the update - your milage will vary. Hooray for Apple.</p>

<p>The screencasts have gone well so far - I have received a lot of valuable feedback and very much appreciate those that have taken the time. I will take the suggestions to heart and try my best to incorporate them. Thank goodness that people have found them helpful in various ways. I have my list of topics that I am guessing people would like - if you have suggestions feel free to drop a comment or an email with your priorities I am always interested.</p>

<p>As many of you know I am an avid film shooter - not for nostalgia&#8217;s sake (well maybe a little) but because I think it is superior in some situations. Of course I shoot digital as well and it has it&#8217;s merits as well. I love that we have both - if you have not shot film in a while or even ever don&#8217;t short change yourself - try some. On that note - a photographer buddy of mine that went pure digital about 5 or 6 years ago is considering shooting film again, not exclusively but along side his digital. Of course I played a part in the subliminal suggestions that he might want to try it.</p>

<p>He is a color guy so no B+W - he is a fairly big time travel photographer that does a lot of landscape work and when he does he treats it very seriously - no need for speed or high ISO. You know the whole nine yards - tripod - ND grad filters, TS lens - the whole bit. The issue is he has a new market for his work - big giant prints - really big. His current kit is 12 MP cameras and we are having a little trouble producing the detail that he wants in his 3 to 4 foot wide prints - yea they look good because everything else is spot on - focus - no camera movement - color - exposure - etc. The important things but&#8230; 12MP even with a lot of tricks falls apart in terms of rendering fine detail. So we are both going to go out and shoot next weekend - his gear and he is going to shoot Velvia 50 in my old FM2 (hooks to his stuff) side by side to see what he likes better for the big enlargements of landscape with high detail - of course the film will get scanned and be output digitally. His conundrum - he does not want to plunk down $8000 plus a spare for the D3x right now and is not even sure if that will cut it - it is a small part of his business (the big prints) and I agree - this is bad timing for $16K on D3X gear. He does not want to go MF digital for two reasons - cost and it is too heavy.</p>

<p>I may bring my large format camera and two lenses with me to shoot 4x5 Velvia - we&#8217;ll see. I have this mentality that if you are going to futz around for 10 minutes with tripods - tilt shift - grad filters for one exposure you may as well shoot sheet film and be done with it - forget the small crap. A decent 4x5 field camera and two decent (spectacular) schneider&#8217;s or rodenstock&#8217;s are dirt cheap compared to MF digital or a one D3X and I will bet you that kit is lighter - he already has a giant carbon fiber tripod and all that crap. I will let you know where he goes with this and how the 35mm experiment turns out.</p>

<p>That brings me to prints - I have been dabbling with my mentioned friend in custom large print services - If getting big prints on good paper from a big Epson at a reasonable cost is something that you are interested in let me know. I may be doing this for a few people shortly.</p>

<p>Speaking of prints - my least popular product - the sample black and white prints (real ones) are selling about 10 copies a month - plenty for me to keep doing and not too much for it to be burdensome based on my current darkroom schedule. Even though they are not that popular to the general web crowd - they are well received by the couple of nutty people that want stuff like this. Number one request - more samples on different materials and larger variety of negative choices. Funny - I did not predict that.</p>

<p>If you have any strange stuff you would like to see in terms of B+W products let me know what specifically you might be interested in seeing - if it makes any sense in terms of time and cost I will probably be willing to produce it.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps - Answer to a few questions about large &#8220;art&#8221; prints that I have received: I do not sell these on-line - I cannot see selling a large expensive to produce and expensive to purchase print sight unseen. If you end up not liking it when you get it - I will feel bad and probably loose money. I do not want people to buy something from me that they do not like. So&#8230; at least for now I will sell hand made B+W final prints the way they should be viewed and acquired - in person.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay - so here is something that might surprise you. I am actually using Faces - not to the extent that <a href="http://bergsmavisuals.com/blog/apple-aperture/organization/the-cases-for-faces-in-aperture-3/">Matthew Bergsma</a> is - check him out but I am using it none the less. I still thing Apple has a lot of work to do with the UI but here are my suggestions on some of the ways to use Faces most effectively.</p>

<p>I did this screencast the same day that I did stacks and albums - I decided to release it a little later because I wanted to get some feedback on the first one before putting this out there. I took some suggestions from that you had from the couple that I put up on Places and books and color and incorporated them into stacks and albums. Namely - go slower - use menus instead of shortcuts - etc. My biggest worry was that I was going too slow - heck this one is 20 minutes on Faces but the feedback that I have gotten so far has been positive so here is the Faces screencast.</p>

<p>By all means keep the feedback and suggestions coming - I want to make these as useful as possible. <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/aperture-3-screencasts/">You can get the screencasts here</a>.</p>
