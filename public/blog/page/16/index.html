  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wanted to share some quick results of my not so scientific testing of the built-in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB002CGSYKS%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Ddp_olp_new%26qid%3D1286031290%26sr%3D8-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">image stabilization of the E-P1</a>. Some of the results I was seeing with it left on at higher shutter speeds made me curious to see if it was adversely impacting image quality. To tell you the truth - I still don&#8217;t have a definitive answer on that but I will get there. In all likelihood it is pilot error and not the actual image stabilization.</p>

<p>In any case here are some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB002I0JKSS%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dsr_1_1_olp%26s%3Delectronics%26qid%3D1286031490%26sr%3D1-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Aperture 3</a> screen shoots at full magnification of my non-clinical testing. For the scientifically minded out there my methodology consisted of the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Focal length 28e.</li>
    <li>Three shots at with and without image stabilization of shutter speeds 1/2 s, 1/6 s, and 1/20 s.</li>
    <li>Same general focus point on the nearest PileOfCrapâ„¢ to my desk.</li>
    <li>Hold the camera as carefully as I can.</li>
    <li>Chose the best out of each group of three to compare.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here is the screen capture at 1/20, no real practical difference accounting for variations in us humanbeans.</p>

</a></p>

<p>Next we have the test at 1/6,</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/ep-6.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/ep-6.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>Last but certainly not least we have 1/2. At this point we are definitely in the realm of needing some technological help as you can clearly ascertain.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/ep-2.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/ep-2.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>The bottom line is the E-P1 internal IS works. The more important thing to note is that what shutter speed you can hand hold a camera at for a given image magnification is highly personal. I expected to see a huge difference in every single shot. I don&#8217;t. At 1/20s and 28e there is no visible difference in any of the 6 shots I made. At 1/6 s the difference is a little more clear, not in my best of the bunch but in the consistency. My non-image-stablized shots at 1/6 are one out of three is good, one is bad, and one is not-so-good but acceptable. The story completely changes at 1/2 s, none of my non-stabilized shots are useable, all of the stabilized shots are.</p>

<p>The amazing part is that my old hands can handhold at these speeds at all. I am shocked considering I had about 4 cups of coffee so far this morning. I am especially surprised that I can hand hold the E-P1 much slower than the GF1 even without IS. I have to investigate this in a more controlled manner. My best with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB002MUAEX4%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Ddp_olp_new_map%26qid%3D1286031379%26sr%3D1-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">GF1</a> and 20mm is 1/20s no matter how many shots I take. More on this later.</p>

<p>The one thing to take away from this is that your own care and practice are at least as valuable as image stabilization. If you can&#8217;t hand hold sharp shots at normal shutter speeds I don&#8217;t think any amount of IS is going to help you. If you have good technique IS is pretty amazing. If you have good technique and you get lazy because you have IS you really don&#8217;t gain that much.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, you people know I am a big fan of shooting RAW+JPEG. I have stated many times that by and large I use the JPEG out of camera. So that begs the question - why do I shoot RAW? Well every once in a while I actually do a lot of post processing. Either planned from the get go or unplanned. Today&#8217;s post is a really super simple stuff Aperture 3 walk through of a semi-planned use of RAW files in a RAW+JPEG workflow. Semi-planned meaning that I was just shooting one of my new micro 4/3 cameras in full auto and letting it do it&#8217;s thing. I probably could have planned a bit better and made the JPEG look about 90% &#8220;right&#8221; out of the camera with manual exposure, manual WB, and setting the saturation and contrast differently but I was lazy and I wanted to play with the E-P1 RAW files anyway.</p>

<p>So here is what I did:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Did my <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2010/09/18/aperture-3-rawjpeg-workflow/">normal RAW+JPEG import work-flow</a> and got rid of 80% of the shots I took.</li>
    <li>I picked a random shot that I thought would look good after post processing and switched the master to RAW via the Photo-&gt;Set RAW as Master menu. Actually I use a shortcut key I set up but that doesn&#8217;t matter.</li>
    <li>Hmmm. This image sucks. Too flat, too dark, and no color. On top of that is it is crooked. It is way different than the scene I shot. The huge difference is in the color. The reason is that the in camera auto white balance tried it&#8217;s best to make it &#8220;neutral&#8221; - who the heck want&#8217;s neutral, neutral sucks. So the first step is straiten.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/post1.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/post1.jpg">
</a></p>

<ul>
    <li>The second step is to set a daylight WB via the handy dandy WB presets provided by Apple.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/post2wb.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/post2wb.jpg">
</a></p>

<ul>
    <li>Okay now we have some color back. In normal circumstances I might increase the exposure and via the exposure controls but in this case I know that I will be screwing around with a lot of contrast and tonal stuff so I will skip that. I also know that I don&#8217;t want to mess with the end points (black and white points) so I am going to skip the tone related sliders altogether as I know I want to mess around in the middle of the tones. I do want to pretend I used a really high saturation film like Velvia so I am going to amp up the vibrancy a bit. I used a value around +20. A little goes a long way. Esp when combined with increased mid-tone contrast. Even in a quiet image like this. Don&#8217;t go too far, especially with images that already have bright bold colors.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/post3vib.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/post3vib.jpg">
</a></p>

<ul>
    <li>Next we move on to dealing with the contrast and tones. This time I am going to use a curves control because for this image it is the most direct way to get to where I want to go. It is twilight so I don&#8217;t want to make the darks darker and I don&#8217;t really want to make the lights a whole lot lighter - maybe a little. I want to bring up the lower mid-tones and increase the mid-tone contrast. So lets put a control point in the darks and leave it be just to keep them nailed. Then let&#8217;s put a control point somewhere around the top end of the lights and drag it up to get the mid-tones looking the way we want.</li>
</ul>

<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/post4curve.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>Okay, I&#8217;m done. It looks like I remember it. Twilight and really nice color. You could go wild and make all the shadows visible or whatever. I just made it look like I would have in camera with film or digital and a little more care.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been shooting with my itty bitty cameras for the last two weeks. Nothing special, the usual stupid stuff in a sort of get to know them sort of way. I thought I would give a brief report on some of my preferences and biases so far.</p>

<ul>
    <li>The overall value prize has to go to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB002CGSYKS%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Ddp_olp_refurbished%26qid%3D1285787301%26sr%3D8-1%26condition%3Drefurbished&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Olympus EP-1</a>. The built in image stabilization is pretty good - it does have some flaws. Namely it seems to be bad for image quality if you have it turned on when you don&#8217;t need it. I need to test this more but I get that overall impression. I can shoot the E-P1 using the IS down to about 1/5 - 1/6 of a second using any focal length of the kit lens. That is pretty amazing. Of course at those speeds you still have to be very very careful. I can not get anywhere near this with the GF1. The out of camera files look great. The high ISO is acceptable. The controls are nice. The camera looks good and feels good. No EVF option is the biggest issue. The kit lens is okay - but you can put any lens on it you want. At $400 bucks new/refurb this is a bargain.</li>
    <li>I like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB002MUAEX4%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Ddp_olp_new_map%26qid%3D1285787359%26sr%3D1-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">GF1 the best</a>. I like handling of the camera with some exceptions. I like the way the files look. I love the 20mm lens (you can put that on the EP-1 as well but that kills the value equation - you may as well get the GF1 kit in the first place). I love the way &#8220;My mode&#8221; works. It really fits the bill for a small high quality image making device with great lens, EVF, and portability for under a $1000 all in. The EP-2 does this as well. Pick your poison - both will do the job but the 20mm lens that you get with the GF1 kills the Oly 17mm in a number of ways. The obvious one being speed - if you try to piecemeal the Oly body/EVF/20mm the price goes over $1000 and unless you MUST have the better EVF I would say that it is not quite worth the money.</li>
    <li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB003WJR69E%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Ddp_olp_new%26qid%3D1285787413%26sr%3D1-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">LX5 is a big surprise</a>. Really nice files, great lens, tiny, do it all. Good image stabilization. Good handling - $500. If you want better high ISO and bigger sensor IQ at $100 less - go for the EP-1, If you want ultimate portability with some IQ sacrifices in certain situations - go for the LX5.</li>
    <li>The Sigma DP1s got returned. The files were interesting from the Foveon but the camera was the biggest piece of garbage as a camera that for me it was unusable. The surprise with it was just how bad a camera Sigma makes. Horrible, I mean really really really horrible. I swear I can shoot sheet film faster than this. Too much pain for too little gain. I will say that I was really surprised by how small the camera itself was for such a big sensor. It was smaller than the GF1, only a little bigger than the LX5. Even at $299 this thing is a dog.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have written more than a few times that I typically use the Z key to evaluate image detail for sharpness, noise, etc. Especially when comparing two similar images. I do this because it&#8217;s faster for me than using the loupe tool. So does that leave the loupe tool sort of orphaned and unused, for me the answer is no. I use the Loupe tool mainly for color evaluation and manipulation.</p>

<p>This Aperture 3 super simple stuff post is a two fold message - the first being about the loupe tool, the second being about color numbers in general. Way back in the olden days there were two different kinds of color numbers that people looked at, RGB and CMYK. The only people that lived and died by these numbers were color separation geeks. They had not much choice. For some ridiculous reason the photographic community sort of latched on to these numbers and tried to make them meaningful when evaluating and processing images. The reality is they are not intuitive to deal with when trying to get anything done photographically. Thats because all components of that number, RGB, change for every single thing you change from a photographic perspective. Want to change saturation, all three numbers change, luminance, all three numbers change, actual color value - same - all three numbers change.</p>

<p>Here is where HSL color numbers come in very useful. Each one is completely independent for the other numbers. No matter how saturated or bright a color is the hue number is the same if it is the same color, etc. This is great because you also have a color control block that manipulates these values directly for any color, combination of colors, or range of colors. So here is how to use the loupe as a handy tool to inspect that HSL number.</p>

<p>Step one, make sure that the loupe tool is setup to display color information.</p>

<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/color3.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>Step two, using the gear menu in the adjustment inspector set the color information display to HSL and use a medium or broad sample point</p>

<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/color1.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>Step there, use the back quote key to toggle the loupe on or off like this and enjoy easy to reference, easy to comprehend color information that correlates directly to the color adjustment block sliders.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So&#8230; I went to my neighborhood Octoberfest yesterday. Actually it was more Septemberfest and the main event was a chili cook-off. Hey what did you expect in rural Maryland. We do things a little different here. I shot a couple of images with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB002MUAEX4%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dsr_1_1_olp%26s%3Delectronics%26qid%3D1285519516%26sr%3D1-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">GF1</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB003WJR69E%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dsr_1_1_olp%26s%3Dgateway%26qid%3D1285519472%26sr%3D8-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">LX5</a> and treated them both like point and shoots. You know the drill, auto everything, Program mode, etc. They weren&#8217;t in dummy mode but close to it. I didn&#8217;t even bother choosing focus points for any of the images I snapped.</p>

<p>Mind you the images are nothing special I just wanted to get a feel for what the cameras would do un-attended. I did learn a few things and thought I would share them with you.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Both Panasoic cameras have a giant propensity to gravitate towards a wide-open Aperture in program mode left to their own devices. I guess this is okay but does take some getting used to if you are used to say Nikon&#8217;s program mode. I guess I found this surprising because I have been &#8220;testing&#8221; both cameras in situations where the amount of light would dictate a wider Aperture and reasonable shutter speed so that the camera did not have to boost the ISO. In this case I saw shutter speeds of 1/1000 at ISO 100 while program mode was choosing f 1.7 and such. I wasn&#8217;t really paying attention while shooting but afterwards saw this as not so good in P+S mode when doing casual environmental portraits while letting the camera choose the focus point. Bad combo because the focus point was almost always where you don&#8217;t want it. Like on the forward sleeve vs. the eye/face. Beware in auto-everything mode of this. If you choose the focus point - no worries.</li>
    <li>If there is a hint of sunlight in a shady scene both the LX5 and GF1 auto WB seem to choose a WB toward sunlight. Again no big deal but something to be aware of if you want to use the JPEGs. RAW - who cares.</li>
    <li>Both cameras were plenty fast enough for this kind of event. Amazing. All the bad images - most of them in this case, were my fault. Not the camera locking up or not responding quick enough.</li>
    <li>If you worry about no DOF effects with either camera - don&#8217;t. In real world shooting at real world distances both of these lenses, the 20mm 1.7 and 24-90 f 2.8 look great wide open.</li>
    <li>The autoflast/force flash on both of these cameras used as fill is WAY TOO MUCH. Be prepared to dial it down if you use it. In not one instance did it not add too much flash for fill. Looks like shit, I would say you will have to use -1 all the time but will experiment. I don&#8217;t use on-camera fill much for my use but thought you would want to know.</li>
    <li>The GF1 image quality is much better than the LX5 - even at low ISO in a lot of circumstances. I will dig into this with more analysis but for now here is what I mean. It&#8217;s not like I am unhappy with the LX5 at all. I love it but in some circumstances - not the ones you would imagine like high ISO, in normal bright light, the LX5 takes on that small, junky, P+S look like all small cameras used to. Sort of a smeared over, plastic-y, over edge sharpened look if you know what I mean. The GF1 always looks great. I will see if I can figure out what provokes it in the LX5. Strange. To be blunt I think all of the Canon S90/S95/G10/G11 images look like this so the fact that the LX5 only does it sometimes is a good thing. The fact the GF1 never does is great.</li>
</ol>


<p>That&#8217;s all for now. Will update. Here are a couple of random shots with notes in captions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here is a quick Aperture 3 super simple stuff post for a slow Sunday. Aperture 3 folders, not just for breakfast anymore. Actually I wanted to talk about folders that contain projects and other folders, not folders inside of projects. Of course they are handy for removing visual clutter from the project inspector but if that&#8217;s all you are using them for you are shortchanging yourself.</p>

<p>The great thing about consolidating multiple projects into some sort of logical grouping using folders is that they act sort of like mini-libraries by restricting search context to only images that are contained within projects under that folder. This is fantastic for restricting quick searches to a particular genre like family, landscape, etc. This unsung feature of Aperture is one that saves me a lot of time and effort to get at a group of my top rated images by subject or genre.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/folder1.jpg" rel="lightbox">

</a></p>

<p>Think about this for a second and what it can mean to you. I have talked with gaggles of people that unlike me obsess over some universal methodology to assign ratings to images. The fuss and worry and philosophize over how a 4star image of junior relates to a 4star image of Angelina Jolie and what it all means. Once shown the power and glory of the simple restrictive context folder and how those two things can mean completely different things in a search they are free to use all that obsessive brain power on more pressing issues.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If I were a real blogger I would go out of my way to set this kind of stuff up. Actually I do go out of my way to set this kind of stuff up but not being tuned in to using it as material for a written piece I don&#8217;t shoot the bad angles. I only shoot the good ones or at least try to. My really late new years resolution is to take the bad shots and the good shots and try to explain the differences. Not in terms of the image - that&#8217;s obvious but more in terms of exactly what I was thinking and what actions I actually took to make it better. Now all I got to do is remember to actually do that because it has become so automatic I rarely think about it with any degree of conscious thought.</p>

<p>This is a really stupid example but it happened to be an occasion where I was out shooting anything interesting I could find after getting a sandwich with my new little <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CGSYKS?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002CGSYKS&quot;">E-P1</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB002MUAEX4%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Ddp_olp_new_map%26qid%3D1285429963%26sr%3D8-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">GF-1</a> cameras. This means it was crappy midday light. I stumbled across a really old church in my town - I mean really old built during colonial times. This particular situation wasn&#8217;t anything special but it hit me like a ton of bricks.</p>

<p>Here is a ho-hum subject - doesn&#8217;t really matter, it&#8217;s not important it&#8217;s an illustration, from the WRONG side.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9130564-full.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9130564-full.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>Now let&#8217;s step 2 and a half feet to the right - oh, is that the same thing at the same time of day in the same light? Yep.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9130565-full.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9130565-full.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>The light and the subject can be exactly the same but standing 3 feet one way or three feet the other is make or break, do or die. This is true no matter what you shoot. The three feet in this case of where I was standing might not be the deal breaker it may be a 5 minute difference if you are a landscape shooter, it may be a fraction of an inch if you are a people shooter. The point is that a tiny change in perspective, point of view, or lighting angle is the difference between blah and KABOOM.</p>

<p>When I do lighting workshops this is what I try to illustrate no matter what technical crap is on the agenda. I have a couple of lighting setups that help illustrate this with undeniable truth. After learning how the gear works, and the metering should be done, etc, etc. When every one is shooting the same thing in the same light - the differences in the resulting shots are huge. This is when the real light bulb goes off and photographers can really move to the next level. Keep this in mind during your endeavors while wrestling with all the functions and settings on your gear and more in mind when you have some sort of gear inferiority complex.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love metadata. It&#8217;s like exercise, not fun but the results are great. I am by no means a metadata nazi or anything. I do just enough to get by. If I were a stock shooter I would do more - a lot more but I am not so I can get a way with it. This is another in my series of Aperture 3 super simple stuff posts and I figured I would blend in some creative ways to use the super simple stuff.</p>

<p>The reason I love metadata is how much you can learn about your own shooting without doing any work. It&#8217;s useful for boring real work to, or at least making boring real work faster. I wanted to take a moment to show just one thing you can do with creative use of metadata searches and smart albums. Say for a moment you shoot with a bunch of different cameras with different sized sensors and a bunch of different lenses and you want to get a sense of what you really gravitate to in terms of angle of view an perspectives with what subjects.</p>

<p>This one is easy - just use the EXIF data. You don&#8217;t even need to type it in, it&#8217;s already there every time you take a shot with your digital camera. The really cool thing is the focal length (35mm) field. The vast majority of camera makers provide this 35mm equivalent focal length field in the EXIF. Here is what I do with it.</p>

<p>Create a top level folder and call it focal length.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/folder.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/folder.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>Inside that folder a create a bunch of smart albums that look for the 35mm equivalent in ranges. Like this. I happen to use super-wide, wide, normalish, and tele for my own purposes. Since I have done this more than once I make smart albums. Jamming them in a folder is nice to keep them out of the way. Make sure you click on the &#8220;Library&#8221; at the top of the search criteria so that your search will be in the context of all of your photos.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/search1.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/search1.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>This kind of stuff is not only fun to understand your shooting habits but it&#8217;s practical as well. Say you are wondering if you should by the kit zoom or the normal 20mm prime on your GF1. Understanding your shooting history on all your other zooms in the normalish range can help. Wanna see some stuff you NEVER do just do a search inside your wide smart album for other stuff like keywords for portrait or something. Wow, there are none, nice exercise you need to go shoot some wide angle environmental portraits. This can help in more creative ways than I can explain.</p>

<p>You get the idea. Have fun. I use this for all sorts of crazy stuff like overall color keyword searches - yes I keyword my images for overall color in the image. Whatever my initial impression is. Like &#8220;red&#8221;. You wouldn&#8217;t believe that strange juxtapositions I get with searches on things like that. It actually gives me new shooting ideas as well. Metatdata is so boring if you only use it for finding that picture of your aunt-in-law that you shot in oregon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am a big fan of automatically stacking new versions created in Aperture. You can do that via preference settings. I am also a big fan of having a separate album for each different kind of version that you create from the same image master. One for black and white, one for special color treatments, one for 8x10 crops, etc, etc. I explain why this is a good thing about a thousand times in old posts and in the eBooks but what if you didn&#8217;t do that and have a bunch of stacks with all sorts of versions in the stack with no rhyme or reason?</p>

<p>With some of Aperture 3&#8217;s new search features it&#8217;s really easy to make an album of versions with album picks of those adjustment types after the fact. I&#8217;ll walk you through it step by step. Let&#8217;s start with a bunch of stacks of images containing the unmolested version and a black and white version and you want to end up with an album where all the black and white version show up on the top of the stack when the stacks are closed.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Do a quick search in the image browser with all the stacks open and add a search criteria for adjustment.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/search.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/search.jpg">
</a></p>

<ul>
    <li>Now that you are looking at just the black and white versions, select all of them via the edit menu or command+A.</li>
    <li>Next use command+L or right click new album to create a new album. Call it &#8220;Black and White&#8221; and make sure the include selected images is checked.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/album.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/album.jpg">
</a></p>

<ul>
    <li>Note that in the new album all of the black and white images that were selected have a little check mark on them at the top. These are the album picks even though they are most likely located further down in the stack. This is because they were the actual images selected when the album was created. This also happens automatically when you create a new version while looking at an image via an album. Very powerful.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/albumpicks.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/albumpicks.jpg">
</a></p>

<ul>
    <li>Close all the stacks via the stack menu or or Option+; Stacks are the most powerful when the are CLOSED. They are a mess when they are open unless you happen to be searching.</li>
</ul>


<p>Wow that was fun. Use this kind of thing to create a nice album organization inside of your projects using just about any criteria you can think of instead of a giant heap of image versions. You don&#8217;t have to just use adjustment searches. File type is another good one to use if you edited a bunch of your images in an external editor or plug-in. Just search on PSD or TIFF instead. Once they are in their own album it is a piece of cake to close the stacks and add other metadata to the whole lot of them as a global indicator for their purpose be it flags, custom metadata fields, whatever. Some times I don&#8217;t even bother with that because once they are in an album you have a work-flow record of what you did and know pretty much why you did it.</p>

<p>I use albums for just about every thing any time I make a selection. More on that later, this is my latest in my new Aperture 3 - super simple stuff series. Let me know if it is too simple and what direction you want me to take the series.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is an interesting development. It appears you can get a white <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_ss_i_5_9%26field-keywords%3Dpanasonic%2520lx5%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%26sprefix%3Dpanasonic&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">Panasonic LX5</a> about 50 bucks cheaper than a black LX5. Wonder why that is. Typically the &#8220;designer colors&#8221; seem to go for a shade more than plain old Model T black. I personally would not buy a white camera. Not because I have some sort of security issue with my manhood but because it most likely would look like crap after a few days of shooting it with my grubby hands.</p>

<p>On the other hand I once had a yellow Hasselblad. Who knows, maybe I can find a way to save more money buy getting a white LX5 to.</p>
