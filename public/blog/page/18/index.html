  <div class="entry-content"><p>I really like these little guys if you couldn&#8217;t tell. Handling on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB002MUAEX4%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Ddp_olp_new_map%26qid%3D1284592102%26sr%3D1-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">GF1</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB003WJR69E%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Ddp_olp_new%26qid%3D1284592151%26sr%3D1-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">LX5</a> are very very similar. I do wish they were exactly the same but they are close enough. I wanted to provide a couple of images so you could all see how big they are and how similar they are. I also wanted to provide a little additional commentary on the GF1 since I got the new one the other day.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9150599.jpg"></p>

<p>First off I would declare the focusing speed between the E-P1 and GF1 a tie. One will do better on some scenes and the other will do better on others. Both of them are fast enough for most things. I guess growing up with rangefinders and manual focus I am not that picky. Neither of these micro 4/3 cameras are so bad that I wouldn&#8217;t use them for just about anything I shoot. You may have to use your head in certain situations but as I said - if you can&#8217;t nail just about anything you want and are prepared to shoot there is a good chance it&#8217;s not the camera&#8217;s fault.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9150606.jpg"></p>

<p>There are some things that I really like on the GF1 - when you are in single area auto focus you can move the area around easily and change the size from really broad to microscopic. The E-P1 in the same mode allows you to quickly change around a bunch of fixed size/fixed position focus areas. Personally I like the GF1&#8217;s operation better. Put the focus point anywhere and make it as broad or as precise as you like. In my reality I will know compositionally how I want my shot to turn out and what focus point I care about. The down side is moving the focus spot around is slower than the method of the E-P1. I can see where some would care about that more. My understanding is that the E-P2 operates somewhere in between what the GF1 does and the E-P1 does. In other words fix points and choice of two sizes. That might be best of all. (uh oh, no, no, there is no E-P2 needed here).</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9150610.jpg"></p>

<p>Here is the big surprise - the LX5 focuses as fast or faster than both of them. I don;t think it is a software/method thing. I really think that the two micro 4/3 lenses that I own right now, the Panasonic 20mm f/1.7 and the Olympus 14-42 have really slow motors compared to say a Nikon AFS 24-70 f/2.8. Maybe we&#8217;ll see some faster ultrasonic motors down the road. I hear that the Panasonic 14-42 is much faster (no - not enough in the &#8220;saved money&#8221; account for that, see that&#8217;s why I got the LX5). The only situation where the LX5 is slower is extreme macro (none of them are super fast in that scenario) and when the light is very low. The E-P1 and the GF1  kill the LX5 in low light.</p>

<p>As you can see the design of the GF1 and LX5 are almost identical. I really like what they did with the grip on the LX5 -  hope to see that down the road in the GF2 or something. You can&#8217;t tell but it&#8217;s rubberized and not only looks good but really helps hold this little guy. What you can&#8217;t see in the images is how classy both these cameras look in person. They are really good looking devices. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB002CGSYKS%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Ddp_olp_new_map%26qid%3D1284592021%26sr%3D8-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">Olympus Pen</a>&#8217;s have the overall style and looks award but&#8230; To tell you the truth I really like the GF1 and LX5 better in real life. Not nearly as heavy as the E-P1 but very very solid and sturdy. They feel good and I feel a little less like I am wearing some piece of jewelry. Not a big thing but the Olympus might be too pretty.</p>

<p>In terms of controls I like the actual physical buttons and wheels on the E-P1 better. They feel better and are slightly better placed for my hands but it&#8217;s a close contest. I would say they are all workable. No real complaints but my biggest complaint is that the Panasonic jog wheel on both the GF1 and LX5 are too too tight and the button action built into the jog wheel is too hard to press. There is no way to &#8220;accidentally&#8221;  move that wheel or cause it to depress. I guess that&#8217;s good but you can go too far. They have way more resistance than a Nikon jog wheel and they are smaller. I hope I can loosen them up over time. This is funny because the Olympus thumbwheel gets complained about being too easy to turn, I would say not.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yep - UPS guy just came. Not a whole lot to report here but&#8230;</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB003WJR69E%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Ddp_olp_new%26qid%3D1284481941%26sr%3D8-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Panasonic LX5</a> is NOT going back. I can tell you that right now. I bet the farm on it being better handling and more responsive than the LX3 and guess what&#8230; I was right. This thing handles EXACTLY like the GF! and seems to focus not only as fast but FASTER. I will test this to make sure but my initial impressions are that it is faster. This is really good for a point and shoot. I will definitely give the full report very soon but I can tell you some very cool things right now.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Great controls for such an itty bitty camera.</li>
    <li>Zoom step option is great. Click the little zoom control one way or another and you have instant 24, 28, 35, 50, 90 - Awesome.</li>
    <li>The manual focus and focus controls in general are unbelievably good. I wish the GF1 and E-P1 operated the same way or at least sort of the same way. More on this later.</li>
    <li>Built in image stabilization exceeds my expectation and give the few shots I made - carelessly - seems to border on greatness.</li>
    <li>Image quality is great at 400 (needs more testing at other speeds)</li>
    <li>Crazy macro capability.</li>
    <li>Fantastic screen.</li>
    <li>Very very solid little camera.</li>
    <li>Did I say the controls were great? How about awesome. Very well thought out. Very useable. I am sure I will find some annoyances and you will hear about them.</li>
    <li>Gorgeous! Beautiful little piece of equipment.</li>
    <li>RAW+JPEG does not lock up the camera. Hooray, I can take another shot IMMEDIATELY. I will push this to it&#8217;s limits and let you know how it goes.</li>
    <li>The direct access to multiple sets of custom settings via the main dial is a great idea - one of the best things about the GF1. Identical on the LX5.</li>
    <li>New grip design is very comfortable.</li>
    <li>My giant sized hands can operate this thing and it is very very very very small by my standards.</li>
</ol>


<p>Here is the very very first shot I took. Again my patented StupidCrap™ test target of whatever is in my pocket thrown onto the desk in bad light. Here are the specs - 24mm f/2.0 1/25 ISO 400 no fooling around strait &#8220;normal&#8221; camera settings across the board. Selected the focus point, made it tiny, jammed the camera up to it and snapped the image.</p>

<p>I will save you the gory full frame let&#8217;s just look at the 100% crop.</p>

<p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P1000003-big.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2414" title="P1000003-big" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P1000003-big-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>

<p>Good enough? This is the 100% crop - pixel peeping, click on the image and then click on the little icon at the upper right to see all the pixels after having been re-compressed 19 1/2 times. Very cool!</p>

<p>Just as a note both the latest ACR/Lightroom and Aperture RAW converters support the RAW files and my initial impression is that they look worth shooting. Unlike a few years ago with itty bitty cameras. More later</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You can tell I am enamored with this little camera. Too bad I didn&#8217;t get to shoot it all that much today. I did shoot my StupidCrap™ test targets though. If I was being careful I probably would have manually exposed this one or at least exposure compensated it a bit. My guesstimate was that it is a stop off.</p>

<p>No problem - I shot RAW+JPEG so let&#8217;s amp it up in ACR and see how the little RAW file does.  In the past bitty camera RAW was not really worth a whole lot because the sensor&#8217;s dynamic range was so limited anyway - and because there was so much noise below about level 100 (on a 1-255 scale) that it was pointless. I have to do some real testing to figure out the full story but just screwing with this RAW file I will have to preliminarily declare the LX5 RAW files a win.  So here is the ho-hum underexposed shot.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P1000091_1.jpg"></p>

<p>And low and behold the RAW file pushed a whopping 1 and 1/2 stops. No noise reduction. No crap. Oh and I cranked the vibrance just shy of blowing the red channel to.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P1000091_2.jpg"></p>

<p>Not bad. I will have to do a lot more testing but RAW and the LX5 appears to actually be worthwhile.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I broke down and bought the EVF for the GF-1. I know that I said I wouldn&#8217;t do it for a few months but I had to. You see, it again was better than free. I will explain that in a minute but first I will tell you why. The two things that I worry about being sans viewfinder are my personal preference, which I am trying to get over and more importantly - the ability to hold the stinking camera still when taking a picture.</p>

<p>No matter how I hold it I can probably hold it more steady than the casual snapshooter that I see jerking the camera with immense force with every shutter release but I know from a scientific and experience standpoint that holding a camera with arms extended vs against your body arms close in is far less steady. I proved it to myself. The included images are my clinical, carefully controlled experiments of shooting with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB002MUAEX4%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Ddp_olp_new_map%26qid%3D1284477380%26sr%3D8-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Panasonic GF1</a> and my StupidCrap™ sharpness test target that consisted of whatever was in my pocket at the time laid out on my desk.</p>

<p>How did I do? Well with the focal length equivalent of a 40mm, the slowest speed with arms extended with perfect results that I could achieve close up was 1/30 second. I know - you say - that&#8217;s not so bad, especially for perfect. Well for me it is. I want at least a stop more. What&#8217;s worse is that the results fall off so quickly that I will not even show you the image at 1/15 - I am too embarrassed. I can do this every time at 1/30 and NEVER even close at 1/15.</p>

<p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P1070017.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2409" title="P1070017" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P1070017-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>

<p>And off course the required 100% view - click to see it in all it&#8217;s pixels.</p>

<p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P1070017-crop.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2407" title="P1070017-crop" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P1070017-crop-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>

<p>I know, you are all thinking &#8220;hey guy just use the stinking E-P1 with image stabilization - duh&#8221;. I am thinking that as well but there may be a hang up there. I will report on it as soon as I do some real tests but anecdotal evidence suggests that in a large number of circumstances that I would want it (shorter focal lengths - close up at slow speeds) it may actually be counter productive. The jury is still out on that one.</p>

<p>So I will still use both the E-P1 and the GF1 without viewfinder where possible to cure myself of the bias I have but when push comes to shove and the shutter speeds get slow I will pop on the EVF so that I can hold the camera properly.</p>

<p>So how did I save money on this latest bit of gear acquisition craziness? Well, we&#8217;ll just pull out the old rationalization math and see won&#8217;t we.</p>

<ol>
    <li>The GF1 EVF only costs about $100 now so if I buy that it will definitely delay my purchase if not supplant it altogether of an E-P2 w/ EFV kit. So there is somewhere between a $200 and $1000 savings. Either the whole cost or at least the time value savings for when I do buy an E-P2.</li>
    <li>Since it fits the LX5 that I just bought I can divide the cost among both cameras and it only costs half as much, let&#8217;s say $50 spread across two cameras.</li>
    <li>It will help me take non-blurry photos hand held which in some circumstances could stop me from breaking the GF1 and the LX5 in a fit of rage down the road - that is like over $1000 in savings.</li>
    <li>So by spending the $50 (see how it&#8217;s half now because we are only talking about the GF1 cost center account) I am going to pocket somewhere between $200 and $2000 of money I don&#8217;t have. Once that matures with the other $3000 that I put in the &#8220;found money&#8221; account I should be able to get something really nice.</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As usual I didn&#8217;t go more than a few feet from my desk today. Grrrr. I just had to shot a few test shots with the baby camera while going back and forth between the phone, my desk, the coffee pot, and outside for a quick smoke.</p>

<p>Here are just a couple samples from JPEGs of my patented StupidCrap™ series of test subjects. I did setup the camera to function the way I wanted it to but other than that nothing super careful. Some of these I couldn&#8217;t even see on the LCD because of the position. Not bad for a variety of auto ISO up to 800 a variety of lighting conditions and above all the StupidCrap™ test subjects.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sometimes I forget how the web works. Briefly - anything &#8220;new&#8221; is great, anything old sucks (according to google). Since the vast majority of people out there use Google not just to find information but to navigate the web as one big site I thought I would re-publish some of the notes on using Aperture&#8217;s book tool with other printers. So here is a handy index to notes compiled so far.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most of you know that I have never owned a point and shoot digicam. The big reason was not image quality but that was an obstacle as well. The big reason was handling and responsiveness. I checked out the G9 Canon and the S90 and&#8230; and&#8230; I really thought the LX3 that was released about two years ago but alas the handling and responsiveness feel short of me ever wanting to use it.</p>

<p>I really wish that wan&#8217;t so because the camera was just the right size for me and the image quality was everything that I wanted for a point and shoot. If you look closely at the changes for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB003WJR69E%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dsr_1_1_olp%26qid%3D1284388619%26sr%3D8-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">the LX5</a> as compared to the LX3 you can see that in reality they are very focused on handling and responsiveness. The controls and interface are for the most part lifted strait off the GF1. In fact there are even a couple of improvements. All of the techno-speak of improvements to dynamic range and high-ISO, etc are just icing on the cake for me. If I can actually enjoy using the camera while shooting that is what will make me a believer. I sure do hope it turns out well - you will hear it first.</p>

<p>I have no delusions when comparing it to pro DSLR&#8217;s, thats stupid. If it handles well, doesn&#8217;t stop me from making a couple of images real fast and looks great at ISO 100 and 200. I am happy. Even 400 is gravy. If it is at all acceptable above that - that is heaven.</p>

<p>As an aside one of the best places you can look to figure out if a camera is going to meet your needs for image quality is Flickr. Forget the bogus tests and evaluations and comparisons that deal with image quality. They are narrow and flavored entirely by the writers perspective and agenda. Even mine. I am interested more in real world use and that&#8217;s probably what I will focus on when discussing this camera.</p>

<p>The reason I bring up Flickr is that a lot of reports on a cameras image quality is that the photos are terrible and don&#8217;t represent what I would actually shoot in the real world. On Flickr you can find a million images exactly like what you want to shoot in scenes you want to shoot them in. I know this is obvious - the secret is the EXIF data. When you run across someone that doesn&#8217;t do a lot of post processing it is fairly obvious - not only from the images but the EXIF as well. The EXIF also reveals the hard cold facts as to the parameters set in the camera under the conditions you can see with results you can see.</p>

<p>I always go through this exercise when deciding on a camera. I did the same thing for the LX3 - in fact that is when I decided to investigate one hands on last year. I still have a few of the image sets that caused me to want that camera to work for me. Heck the LX5 is brand new so there isn&#8217;t a whole lot to evaluate yet but from my perspective it could stay exactly the same image quality wise and I would be fine. If it&#8217;s better that&#8217;s great. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25983110@N05/sets/72157622781596412/with/4409813093/">Check this out and carefully look at the EXIF</a> - no this camera isn&#8217;t a super high ISO monster but look what it can do if you can live within the  parameters where it does operate well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am a big fan of shooting RAW+JPEG. I don&#8217;t worry about it, I don;t make decisions about it. I just set my camera to RAW+JPEG and never think about it again. I use my out of camera JPEG files most of the time unless I have a good reason to use the RAW files. I like that I can change the look of them with ease. Most of my new cameras produce fantastic looking JPEG files be it black and white, auto noise reduction, simulated film &#8220;looks&#8221; whatever.</p>

<p>For the most part I love RAW+JPEG because I don&#8217;t have to decide anything, it saves me a ton of time and it gives me ultimate flexibility. Memory cards are dirt cheap, at this rate I may not even bother erasing them any more (well I guess I will for the time being). It even saves you time in post processing. Take Aperture 3 for instance. It&#8217;s new features for dealing with the import of RAW+JPEG pairs is a fantastic time saver.</p>

<p>Here is my &#8220;normal&#8221; work-flow:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Shoot RAW+JPEG in the camera.</li>
    <li>Import JPEG only using the option to do so in the RAW+JPEG pairs option block in the import interface.</li>
    <li>Blast through the JPEGS and reject the ones I don&#8217;t want. This is really really fast since you don&#8217;t have to wait for the import of your huge RAW files and subsequent Aperture processing of them to render thumbnails or previews. It&#8217;s faster to zip through them as well.</li>
    <li>After my reject pass I open up the import interface again and use the &#8220;Matching RAW files&#8221;<a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/matching.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2398" title="matching" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/matching.jpg" alt="" width="285" height="218" /></a> option in the RAW+JPEG pairs control block.</li>
</ol>


<p>What I end up with is only importing the RAW files for the images I actually give a crap about and the RAW+JPEG&#8217;s managed together as a &#8220;dual master&#8221; with the JPEG&#8217;s active by default. If you want to know how to change this around <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2010/02/11/aperture-3-rawjpg-part-deuxs/">take a look at this post</a>. There are all kinds of options for telling Aperture 3 what &#8220;matching RAW files&#8221; you actually want imported or are talking about. If you have any questions just ask.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/5XBWaxed.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2395" title="5XBWaxed" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/5XBWaxed-300x244.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="244" /></a>This is officially third in a serious of rationalization lessons for acquiring photo gear since I went on the binge last week. This lesson/idea is actually also a follow up to my &#8220;all camera bags are too small&#8221; post from a while ago. Actually they are all exactly the right size. This time around I am shifting that whole notion into reverse.  I just acquired a new bag - yes another one. It is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB002BH3XXQ%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dsr_1_1_olp%26qid%3D1284410226%26sr%3D8-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">Domke F-5XB</a>. The point of this purchase was multi-faceted and as you will see when I walk you through the rationalization the primary money saving idea is reenforced with all the other good things that happen.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s start with the money saving part of this. This bag is tiny, really tiny. Tinier than my beloved F-803&#8217;s. I know from personal experience how easy it is to spend way over $10,000 to fill one of those so by definition and experience that bag is too too big. I need a smaller bag as my absolute hard limit on micro 4/3 equipment and other itty bitty camera stuff that I am acquiring at an alarming rate. Hence when I cannot stuff anything else into the F-5XB I am done, hard stop, buying bitty camera stuff. See how that saves me money? You don&#8217;t - let me explain a little further so you can see how thought through this really is.</p>

<ol>
    <li>The F-5XB can hold at least 2 bodies and 4 micro 4/3 lenses LESS than an F-803.</li>
    <li>The F-5XB is about half of the cost of suggested retail price because it&#8217;s not real popular. You can get it for like 70 bucks. If you go with a popular one like the F-803 they are a lot more money too. Yea I know I already have two F-803&#8217;s but that doesn&#8217;t count. You have to have apples to apples you see or it&#8217;s not scientific.  That&#8217;s like evaluating the idea of which restaurant to go to based on lunch meat you happen to have - invalid.</li>
    <li>So for 70 bucks it will save me like another 80 bucks by not using my existing F-803. If you don&#8217;t get this then you have never had to do any time of corporate cost accounting. We have to put the already spent cost on the F-803 somewhere don&#8217;t we? Right now it&#8217;s allocated to general maintenance because my other one was wearing out. So I am going to leave it there rather than allocate it to the micro 4/3 itty bitty camera cost center. So I saved like 70 bucks on micro 4/3 just by buying the 5XB. Get it?</li>
    <li>The real meat of the savings is the cost avoidance factors of probably another 3 grand minimum. The F-803 could easy fit an additional 3 grand. Maybe more. I will save that up for something else that I &#8220;need&#8221;. This actually is money that doesn&#8217;t exist that goes into another account to be used in future rationalizations about spending money on gear. This is the very basic part of the &#8220;found money&#8221; rationalization I use for really expensive stuff like medium format gear. You know capital investments like battleships and the like.</li>
    <li>It matches my new F-803, the new &#8220;ruggedwear&#8221; stuff. Hey my camera bag collection was getting a little non-symetrical and that could cause me all kind of heartache and subconscious stress that would add up in medical costs down the road. This will help bring back the symmetry.</li>
    <li>It&#8217;s more water resistant than my old depreciated F-803 so it&#8217;s like insurance for my micro 4/3 stuff.</li>
</ol>


<p>So you see this 70 bucks saves me a whole lot of money in a lot of different ways. How could I not buy it. It&#8217;s better than free, it actually saves me a ton of money. Tune in next time when I write of one of three Domke F-2&#8217;s and replace it with a ruggedwear version of the same thing to save money. I feel the thrust of that will be in saving time by not having to decide between black and sand and time=money. We&#8217;ll see.</p>
