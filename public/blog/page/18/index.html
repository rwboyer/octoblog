  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple of readers sent me some email regarding RAW+JPEG work-flow questions. Most of them were very specific to their particular needs so I won&#8217;t go into the gory details of my replies to them. Too boring. I will publish some additional thoughts here and there as time permits because what I consider an obvious work-flow is not so obvious to a lot of Aperture users out there. That and the RAW+JPEG option is something that a lot of people haven&#8217;t explored that much.</p>

<p>I never shoot RAW only, never have and probably never will. I used to shoot JPEG only but not any more. The only reason that I used to shoot JPEG only is when memory cards were small and expensive. Now that I am no longer constrained in any meaningful way RAW+JPEG seems to me as the only way to go. I guess my first digital camera (Nikon D2H) supported RAW+JPEG so well and so fast I never really thought about shooting just RAW. I have never been mired down in any kind of RAW vs JPEG debates and never even saw the point of that debate since I could have both all the time. Having said that, I do use the JPEG files most of the time unless there is a real need to use the RAW files from a quality, correction, or manipulation standpoint. I am really not into screwing with every single frame I shoot. Especially if I like the out of camera JPEGs.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2010/09/13/aperture-3-file-import/">My last post was how time saving RAW+JPEG</a> shooting and importing during the initial stages of an Aperture 3 work-flow and then using the option to import matching RAW files for only the images that you really want the RAW files. I will post something on the 17,000 ways to use that next week. For now I wanted to point out an obvious use of Aperture 3 and RAW+JPEG shooting when your camera doesn&#8217;t have RAW support in Aperture 3 (yet). What I am about to explain isn&#8217;t a &#8220;normal&#8221; work0-flow but it is workable for a while.</p>

<p>Consider this - Aperture 3 will import RAW+JPEG pairs even if the RAW file format is not supported. Yep - this is the case with my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WJR69E?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003WJR69E" target="_blank">Panasoic LX5</a>. For me I don&#8217;t really care because this is what I do as a matter of habit:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Shoot RAW+JPEG</li>
    <li>Import JPEG only</li>
    <li>Go through and reject images that I don&#8217;t want.</li>
    <li>Either import RAW for everything that is not rejected or use a selection for things I want the RAW files for using the import matching RAW functions.</li>
    <li>Using this work-flow, the JPEG is the master that is active by default.</li>
    <li>If the camera is not yet supported, I just use &#8220;show in finder&#8221; via the context menu to have direct access to the RAW master that I am interested in.</li>
    <li>From that point I use open with&#8230; in the finder to use whatever RAW decode I wish.</li>
</ol>


<p>The only extra step is really importing the finished product into Aperture right next to the other masters. No big deal. This kind of thing even works for managed libraries. You just have to do a &#8220;relocate masters&#8230;&#8221; for the image you are interested in. When you are done just use &#8220;consolidate masters&#8230;&#8221; to put the masters back. Obviously this is not fantastic if you are in the habit of screwing with every RAW but that is workable as well, remember Aperture 3 will do everything I just said on any selection of images.</p>

<p>You might be asking &#8220;why  bother&#8221; if Aperture doesn&#8217;t support the RAW files yet. Well, I can do the entire front end of my work-flow from import, reject, rate, metadata, organize, file the masters, create directories based on project automatically, etc, et, the whole nine yards, then bring the RAW in using Aperture 3. This is so fast it&#8217;s crazy and far easier than using finder or something that works like finder to do it. So&#8230; it&#8217;s a little tiny bit slower (as in one step) when I have to monkey with my RAW files - so what?</p>

<p>Try it - if you have any questions just ask.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is not a lens test it is a quick follow up on something I noted the other day regarding a difference in color rendition between the Olympus micro 4/3 kit lens and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB002IKLJVE%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Ddp_olp_new_map%26qid%3D1284664621%26sr%3D8-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Panasonic 20mm f/1.7</a>, I refuse to use the word pancake, crap I just used it. Okay that is the last time I will use that, whey the heck does everyone want to call lenses pancakes?</p>

<p>Any how - I was right, there is a difference in color rendition. Unless you are OCD on this type of thing you won&#8217;t notice really. The funny part is that the rendition is only to some colors. Here is a quick and dirty &#8220;test&#8221; both shot on the E-P1</p>

<p>Frist the Olympus 14-42</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA&#8221; size=&#8221;med&#8221; id=&#8221;2470&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>Next the Panasonic 20mm</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA&#8221; size=&#8221;med&#8221; id=&#8221;2475&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>Yea, yea - I know the focus is different, and I know there is a slightly different exposure but that is not what I am looking at. These were both shot at a fixed daylight WB with seconds of each other in very consistent lighting color. The hue (not saturation and luminance) the actual hue value is almost identical for the more neutral tones in the straw hat. The difference is in the blues and greens in the ribbons. The hue is massively different to my eyes. As measured it&#8217;s about 8-10 points more toward blue - in other words cooler.</p>

<p>My personal preference is the Panasonic&#8217;s color rendering but it doesn&#8217;t really matter you would never really know if you weren&#8217;t looking at them side by side. I know you are going to say that this is all in my head but Leica lenses have the same kind of color rendering difference as compared to say a Nikon lens on the same film. Maybe Panasonic is using Leica designed coatings?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I really like these little guys if you couldn&#8217;t tell. Handling on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB002MUAEX4%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Ddp_olp_new_map%26qid%3D1284592102%26sr%3D1-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">GF1</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB003WJR69E%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Ddp_olp_new%26qid%3D1284592151%26sr%3D1-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">LX5</a> are very very similar. I do wish they were exactly the same but they are close enough. I wanted to provide a couple of images so you could all see how big they are and how similar they are. I also wanted to provide a little additional commentary on the GF1 since I got the new one the other day.</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA&#8221;  size=&#8221;medum&#8221; id=&#8221;2455&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>First off I would declare the focusing speed between the E-P1 and GF1 a tie. One will do better on some scenes and the other will do better on others. Both of them are fast enough for most things. I guess growing up with rangefinders and manual focus I am not that picky. Neither of these micro 4/3 cameras are so bad that I wouldn&#8217;t use them for just about anything I shoot. You may have to use your head in certain situations but as I said - if you can&#8217;t nail just about anything you want and are prepared to shoot there is a good chance it&#8217;s not the camera&#8217;s fault.</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA&#8221;  size=&#8221;medum&#8221; id=&#8221;2457&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>There are some things that I really like on the GF1 - when you are in single area auto focus you can move the area around easily and change the size from really broad to microscopic. The E-P1 in the same mode allows you to quickly change around a bunch of fixed size/fixed position focus areas. Personally I like the GF1&#8217;s operation better. Put the focus point anywhere and make it as broad or as precise as you like. In my reality I will know compositionally how I want my shot to turn out and what focus point I care about. The down side is moving the focus spot around is slower than the method of the E-P1. I can see where some would care about that more. My understanding is that the E-P2 operates somewhere in between what the GF1 does and the E-P1 does. In other words fix points and choice of two sizes. That might be best of all. (uh oh, no, no, there is no E-P2 needed here).</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA&#8221; size=&#8221;ful&#8221; id=&#8221;2458&#8221; align=&#8221;left&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>Here is the big surprise - the LX5 focuses as fast or faster than both of them. I don;t think it is a software/method thing. I really think that the two micro 4/3 lenses that I own right now, the Panasonic 20mm f/1.7 and the Olympus 14-42 have really slow motors compared to say a Nikon AFS 24-70 f/2.8. Maybe we&#8217;ll see some faster ultrasonic motors down the road. I hear that the Panasonic 14-42 is much faster (no - not enough in the &#8220;saved money&#8221; account for that, see that&#8217;s why I got the LX5). The only situation where the LX5 is slower is extreme macro (none of them are super fast in that scenario) and when the light is very low. The E-P1 and the GF1  kill the LX5 in low light.</p>

<p>As you can see the design of the GF1 and LX5 are almost identical. I really like what they did with the grip on the LX5 -  hope to see that down the road in the GF2 or something. You can&#8217;t tell but it&#8217;s rubberized and not only looks good but really helps hold this little guy. What you can&#8217;t see in the images is how classy both these cameras look in person. They are really good looking devices. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB002CGSYKS%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Ddp_olp_new_map%26qid%3D1284592021%26sr%3D8-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">Olympus Pen</a>&#8217;s have the overall style and looks award but&#8230; To tell you the truth I really like the GF1 and LX5 better in real life. Not nearly as heavy as the E-P1 but very very solid and sturdy. They feel good and I feel a little less like I am wearing some piece of jewelry. Not a big thing but the Olympus might be too pretty.</p>

<p>In terms of controls I like the actual physical buttons and wheels on the E-P1 better. They feel better and are slightly better placed for my hands but it&#8217;s a close contest. I would say they are all workable. No real complaints but my biggest complaint is that the Panasonic jog wheel on both the GF1 and LX5 are too too tight and the button action built into the jog wheel is too hard to press. There is no way to &#8220;accidentally&#8221;  move that wheel or cause it to depress. I guess that&#8217;s good but you can go too far. They have way more resistance than a Nikon jog wheel and they are smaller. I hope I can loosen them up over time. This is funny because the Olympus thumbwheel gets complained about being too easy to turn, I would say not.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yep - UPS guy just came. Not a whole lot to report here but&#8230;</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB003WJR69E%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Ddp_olp_new%26qid%3D1284481941%26sr%3D8-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Panasonic LX5</a> is NOT going back. I can tell you that right now. I bet the farm on it being better handling and more responsive than the LX3 and guess what&#8230; I was right. This thing handles EXACTLY like the GF! and seems to focus not only as fast but FASTER. I will test this to make sure but my initial impressions are that it is faster. This is really good for a point and shoot. I will definitely give the full report very soon but I can tell you some very cool things right now.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Great controls for such an itty bitty camera.</li>
    <li>Zoom step option is great. Click the little zoom control one way or another and you have instant 24, 28, 35, 50, 90 - Awesome.</li>
    <li>The manual focus and focus controls in general are unbelievably good. I wish the GF1 and E-P1 operated the same way or at least sort of the same way. More on this later.</li>
    <li>Built in image stabilization exceeds my expectation and give the few shots I made - carelessly - seems to border on greatness.</li>
    <li>Image quality is great at 400 (needs more testing at other speeds)</li>
    <li>Crazy macro capability.</li>
    <li>Fantastic screen.</li>
    <li>Very very solid little camera.</li>
    <li>Did I say the controls were great? How about awesome. Very well thought out. Very useable. I am sure I will find some annoyances and you will hear about them.</li>
    <li>Gorgeous! Beautiful little piece of equipment.</li>
    <li>RAW+JPEG does not lock up the camera. Hooray, I can take another shot IMMEDIATELY. I will push this to it&#8217;s limits and let you know how it goes.</li>
    <li>The direct access to multiple sets of custom settings via the main dial is a great idea - one of the best things about the GF1. Identical on the LX5.</li>
    <li>New grip design is very comfortable.</li>
    <li>My giant sized hands can operate this thing and it is very very very very small by my standards.</li>
</ol>


<p>Here is the very very first shot I took. Again my patented StupidCrap™ test target of whatever is in my pocket thrown onto the desk in bad light. Here are the specs - 24mm f/2.0 1/25 ISO 400 no fooling around strait &#8220;normal&#8221; camera settings across the board. Selected the focus point, made it tiny, jammed the camera up to it and snapped the image.</p>

<p>I will save you the gory full frame let&#8217;s just look at the 100% crop.</p>

<p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P1000003-big.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2414" title="P1000003-big" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P1000003-big-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>

<p>Good enough? This is the 100% crop - pixel peeping, click on the image and then click on the little icon at the upper right to see all the pixels after having been re-compressed 19 1/2 times. Very cool!</p>

<p>Just as a note both the latest ACR/Lightroom and Aperture RAW converters support the RAW files and my initial impression is that they look worth shooting. Unlike a few years ago with itty bitty cameras. More later</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You can tell I am enamored with this little camera. Too bad I didn&#8217;t get to shoot it all that much today. I did shoot my StupidCrap™ test targets though. If I was being careful I probably would have manually exposed this one or at least exposure compensated it a bit. My guesstimate was that it is a stop off.</p>

<p>No problem - I shot RAW+JPEG so let&#8217;s amp it up in ACR and see how the little RAW file does.  In the past bitty camera RAW was not really worth a whole lot because the sensor&#8217;s dynamic range was so limited anyway - and because there was so much noise below about level 100 (on a 1-255 scale) that it was pointless. I have to do some real testing to figure out the full story but just screwing with this RAW file I will have to preliminarily declare the LX5 RAW files a win.  So here is the ho-hum underexposed shot.</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;P1000091_1&#8221; size=&#8221;medium&#8221; id=&#8221;2441&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>And low and behold the RAW file pushed a whopping 1 and 1/2 stops. No noise reduction. No crap. Oh and I cranked the vibrance just shy of blowing the red channel to.</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;P1000091_2&#8221; size=&#8221;medium&#8221; id=&#8221;2450&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>Not bad. I will have to do a lot more testing but RAW and the LX5 appears to actually be worthwhile.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I broke down and bought the EVF for the GF-1. I know that I said I wouldn&#8217;t do it for a few months but I had to. You see, it again was better than free. I will explain that in a minute but first I will tell you why. The two things that I worry about being sans viewfinder are my personal preference, which I am trying to get over and more importantly - the ability to hold the stinking camera still when taking a picture.</p>

<p>No matter how I hold it I can probably hold it more steady than the casual snapshooter that I see jerking the camera with immense force with every shutter release but I know from a scientific and experience standpoint that holding a camera with arms extended vs against your body arms close in is far less steady. I proved it to myself. The included images are my clinical, carefully controlled experiments of shooting with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB002MUAEX4%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Ddp_olp_new_map%26qid%3D1284477380%26sr%3D8-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Panasonic GF1</a> and my StupidCrap™ sharpness test target that consisted of whatever was in my pocket at the time laid out on my desk.</p>

<p>How did I do? Well with the focal length equivalent of a 40mm, the slowest speed with arms extended with perfect results that I could achieve close up was 1/30 second. I know - you say - that&#8217;s not so bad, especially for perfect. Well for me it is. I want at least a stop more. What&#8217;s worse is that the results fall off so quickly that I will not even show you the image at 1/15 - I am too embarrassed. I can do this every time at 1/30 and NEVER even close at 1/15.</p>

<p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P1070017.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2409" title="P1070017" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P1070017-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>

<p>And off course the required 100% view - click to see it in all it&#8217;s pixels.</p>

<p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P1070017-crop.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2407" title="P1070017-crop" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P1070017-crop-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>

<p>I know, you are all thinking &#8220;hey guy just use the stinking E-P1 with image stabilization - duh&#8221;. I am thinking that as well but there may be a hang up there. I will report on it as soon as I do some real tests but anecdotal evidence suggests that in a large number of circumstances that I would want it (shorter focal lengths - close up at slow speeds) it may actually be counter productive. The jury is still out on that one.</p>

<p>So I will still use both the E-P1 and the GF1 without viewfinder where possible to cure myself of the bias I have but when push comes to shove and the shutter speeds get slow I will pop on the EVF so that I can hold the camera properly.</p>

<p>So how did I save money on this latest bit of gear acquisition craziness? Well, we&#8217;ll just pull out the old rationalization math and see won&#8217;t we.</p>

<ol>
    <li>The GF1 EVF only costs about $100 now so if I buy that it will definitely delay my purchase if not supplant it altogether of an E-P2 w/ EFV kit. So there is somewhere between a $200 and $1000 savings. Either the whole cost or at least the time value savings for when I do buy an E-P2.</li>
    <li>Since it fits the LX5 that I just bought I can divide the cost among both cameras and it only costs half as much, let&#8217;s say $50 spread across two cameras.</li>
    <li>It will help me take non-blurry photos hand held which in some circumstances could stop me from breaking the GF1 and the LX5 in a fit of rage down the road - that is like over $1000 in savings.</li>
    <li>So by spending the $50 (see how it&#8217;s half now because we are only talking about the GF1 cost center account) I am going to pocket somewhere between $200 and $2000 of money I don&#8217;t have. Once that matures with the other $3000 that I put in the &#8220;found money&#8221; account I should be able to get something really nice.</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As usual I didn&#8217;t go more than a few feet from my desk today. Grrrr. I just had to shot a few test shots with the baby camera while going back and forth between the phone, my desk, the coffee pot, and outside for a quick smoke.</p>

<p>Here are just a couple samples from JPEGs of my patented StupidCrap™ series of test subjects. I did setup the camera to function the way I wanted it to but other than that nothing super careful. Some of these I couldn&#8217;t even see on the LCD because of the position. Not bad for a variety of auto ISO up to 800 a variety of lighting conditions and above all the StupidCrap™ test subjects.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sometimes I forget how the web works. Briefly - anything &#8220;new&#8221; is great, anything old sucks (according to google). Since the vast majority of people out there use Google not just to find information but to navigate the web as one big site I thought I would re-publish some of the notes on using Aperture&#8217;s book tool with other printers. So here is a handy index to notes compiled so far.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most of you know that I have never owned a point and shoot digicam. The big reason was not image quality but that was an obstacle as well. The big reason was handling and responsiveness. I checked out the G9 Canon and the S90 and&#8230; and&#8230; I really thought the LX3 that was released about two years ago but alas the handling and responsiveness feel short of me ever wanting to use it.</p>

<p>I really wish that wan&#8217;t so because the camera was just the right size for me and the image quality was everything that I wanted for a point and shoot. If you look closely at the changes for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB003WJR69E%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dsr_1_1_olp%26qid%3D1284388619%26sr%3D8-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">the LX5</a> as compared to the LX3 you can see that in reality they are very focused on handling and responsiveness. The controls and interface are for the most part lifted strait off the GF1. In fact there are even a couple of improvements. All of the techno-speak of improvements to dynamic range and high-ISO, etc are just icing on the cake for me. If I can actually enjoy using the camera while shooting that is what will make me a believer. I sure do hope it turns out well - you will hear it first.</p>

<p>I have no delusions when comparing it to pro DSLR&#8217;s, thats stupid. If it handles well, doesn&#8217;t stop me from making a couple of images real fast and looks great at ISO 100 and 200. I am happy. Even 400 is gravy. If it is at all acceptable above that - that is heaven.</p>

<p>As an aside one of the best places you can look to figure out if a camera is going to meet your needs for image quality is Flickr. Forget the bogus tests and evaluations and comparisons that deal with image quality. They are narrow and flavored entirely by the writers perspective and agenda. Even mine. I am interested more in real world use and that&#8217;s probably what I will focus on when discussing this camera.</p>

<p>The reason I bring up Flickr is that a lot of reports on a cameras image quality is that the photos are terrible and don&#8217;t represent what I would actually shoot in the real world. On Flickr you can find a million images exactly like what you want to shoot in scenes you want to shoot them in. I know this is obvious - the secret is the EXIF data. When you run across someone that doesn&#8217;t do a lot of post processing it is fairly obvious - not only from the images but the EXIF as well. The EXIF also reveals the hard cold facts as to the parameters set in the camera under the conditions you can see with results you can see.</p>

<p>I always go through this exercise when deciding on a camera. I did the same thing for the LX3 - in fact that is when I decided to investigate one hands on last year. I still have a few of the image sets that caused me to want that camera to work for me. Heck the LX5 is brand new so there isn&#8217;t a whole lot to evaluate yet but from my perspective it could stay exactly the same image quality wise and I would be fine. If it&#8217;s better that&#8217;s great. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/25983110@N05/sets/72157622781596412/with/4409813093/">Check this out and carefully look at the EXIF</a> - no this camera isn&#8217;t a super high ISO monster but look what it can do if you can live within the  parameters where it does operate well.</p>
