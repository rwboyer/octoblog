She directs her venom at certain wedding photographers but my take is more on the practice as a whole. If you get past her obvious anger and emotion, she actually has a very strong philosophical point. She really really does. I am not in the wedding business nor do I ever plan on being in the wedding business. I honestly couldn&#8217;t do it. Not because I am some sort of elitist but because it is too freaking hard to do the kind of job I would want to do. Actually it is a hard hard way to earn a living any way you slice it, unless you are one of a few &#8220;rock star&#8221; wedding photographers.</p>

<p>If I was in the wedding business I would think really hard about the marketing angle here. No I am not being cold or calculating. I am really talking about connecting with the kind of customers that you really want to work with and a market segment that is, in my opinion underdeveloped. Let&#8217;s call it the &#8220;Dove&#8221; market. Yea, yea, yea - I know all woman want to look good and there is definitely the segment that wants to look like a fashion model even if it has nothing to do with what they actually look like or even what actually happened at their wedding.</p>

<p>What I am talking about is connecting with a market of regular brides, that do not want a &#8220;cinematic&#8221; record of their wedding but instead wants great images of what actually happened and how the wedding actually looked, you know the kind of photographs your family actually treasures - the ones that capture and bring back the memories of the event itself - not memories of how the image was staged or directed. I am no expert but I believe the market is there, I guess it would be the photographers job to do the sell - to me it would be a fantastic way to &#8220;manage expectations&#8221; and have brides that are very very happy with the results. Plus you wouldn&#8217;t have to worry too too much about hiring MUA&#8217;s and models to demonstrate how wonderful people look when you photograph them.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know, maybe I am completely wrong but&#8230; Take a look at the few photos of the Clinton wedding. They hired a freaking PJ for it - a Whitehouse PJ yet. Sounds like this may be the ticket to the &#8220;high-end&#8221; wedding that everyone is seeking.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/2010-006-23.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2121" title="2010-006-23" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/2010-006-23-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>I know I drone on and on about this film stuff but I figured all of you digital only photographers out there could stand a little more. There are still a few of us out there that shoot both. You might remember my hyperbole a while ago when I called the Massive Development Chart &#8220;the most useless thing on the web&#8221;. I did receive some hate mail about that from a few people that thought it was a great resource. We chatted via email and kissed and made up. They didn&#8217;t have an issue with my meaning - they took issue with the big &#8220;H&#8221; word.</p>

<p>Anyhows - I thought I would share a couple of random thoughts on selecting a film developer for those out there that haven&#8217;t settled in on one and only one. Heck I have been developing film for almost 30 years and I still try developers here and there - it&#8217;s fun. Please take these thoughts as guidelines for your own thought process, not as absolutes. In the world of black and white processing and printing one man&#8217;s pleasure is another man&#8217;s poison and I have seen fantastic results for film of all shapes and sizes when it comes to almost every developer. That is why I will talk about characteristics that I observe along with things that are clearly aesthetic opinions. Your aesthetic may vary. As a reference point currently my &#8220;main&#8221; one and only developer is Pyrocat HD for all film formats - 35mm, medium format, and sheet film.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s cover consistency, convenience, and cost first to get those out of the way. Virtually every developer I have used is consistent when used &#8220;properly&#8221;. Unfortunately properly may mean making a fresh stock solution and then a working solution. Any developer that I have used where the stock solution has completely different working characteristics - as in it doesn&#8217;t work anymore inside of one week is off the table for me. D76 was a very nice developer but a pain to mix and you did have to abide by it&#8217;s shelf life recommendations for the stock solution, believe it or not this is one of two powdered developer I used with good results for a long long time at 1+1 and 1+2 dilutions. XTOL was the other one - I wish this worked out for me but I could not take dealing with the mixing and the really fast drop off in activity from fine to pooped out in like 2 days. No way, plus it costs a lot.</p>

<p>Then there is TMAX, great stuff but too expensive since I do everything &#8220;one-shot&#8221;. Okay that leaves us with Rodinal, HC110, and a bunch of &#8220;boutique&#8221; or mixed from scratch recipes developers. Yea there were others but not readily available in pre-internet days. Tried HC110 and really really wanted to like it - all of the factors were there cost/convenience/consistency - too bad to my eyes it looked like absolute dog doo. I really wanted it to be a lot like D76 but the characteristic curve influence that it had was not at all to my liking - in fact it was opposite. I might be able to live with that but in my opinion it produced the world&#8217;s ugliest grain at all dilutions as well. I don&#8217;t mind grain I do mind ugly grain.</p>

<p>On to Rodinal - okay this was the answer - at least for me for a long long long time. Flexible, consistent, cheap, convienient, sharp, A hair less film speed but really - who cares is a 1/3 of a stop really going to make or break you? Yea you could see the grain but it was pretty grain if your film had pretty grain. Too bad it got really hard to get - now it is actually easier to get a Rodinal substitute like R09. Back before the on-line days I lived in places where you could not find Rodinal to save your life and mail order was crappy - esp with Rodinal - ground shipping. What if I needed more.</p>

<p>After Rodinal I ventured into mixing PMK myself. It had a lot of the same things going for it that I liked about Rodinal. Sharp, sharp, sharp, nice grain, and&#8230;. fantastic highlight rendition. Even better than Rodinal at 1+100. So PMK was my mainstay for a long long time. Then I tried Pyrocat - same as PMK, except there were some films on my no-no list that reacted in a way I considered unusable with PMK. Pyrocat HD every film I have ever tried had great results. On top of that the premixed solution in glycol keeps LONGER than Rodinal by a wide margin. Did I mention cheap, sharp, great highlights, great grain, great looking grain?</p>

<p>Flexibility - what does that mean? Well I mean that a developer can do a lot of stuff and carry out a wide range of tasks when called on to do so. Like stand developing - like a huge range of effects and activity via dilution - like a lot of films behaving &#8220;like they should&#8221; in the same developer. That kind of stuff. I really don&#8217;t relish the idea of keeping 90 different chemicals up to date and fresh, nor do I like doing 500,000 tests to figure it all out.</p>

<p>So for me and my recommendation for choosing a developer right here right now I would say:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Pyrocat HD - great characteristics all around, cheap, convienient, flexible.</li>
    <li>Rodinal - same, same, same as Pyrocat but not keep quite as long and has a different rendition of highlight and grain. If you don&#8217;t like Rodinal grain but you do like everything else about it try Pyrocat HD</li>
    <li>XTOL - Nice all the way around, good to great film speed, sharp, not quite as flexible as above but does everything well except stand development, not cheap, not at all convienient does not keep that well so your process must be really fresh all the time. Not quite as sharp as Pyrocat or Rodinal. But if you are up to it no less convienient than any other dry to stock solution to working solution developer.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ps. The associated image with this post was shot yesterday on 9 year out of date Ilford Delta 100 developed in Pyrocat HD and scanned using my patented ShittyScan™ technique - the print looks great. This roll was a bunch of quick around the house shots to test and see if the other dozen rolls of this stuff were worth shooting or they were history. I really get a kick that it is still pretty good after being abused for 9 years.</p>

Apple&#8217;s latest wonderfulness, new support &#8220;communities&#8221;. <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/08/apple-rejiggering-support-forums-with-social-network-bent.ars?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss&amp;comments=1#comments-bar">Read all about it here</a>. You&#8217;ll never guess this next part - are you ready - it is going to be more &#8220;social&#8221;. But wait there is more&#8230;</p>

<p>And get this - you can soon earn &#8220;reputation&#8221; points - how innovative. WTF?</p>

<p>Really? I do try to help some of the seemingly cooler people with issues over there while I am waiting for my film to dry but you have got to be kidding me. I am going to have to deal with freaking &#8220;friends&#8221; and crap.</p>

<p>I really don&#8217;t think it needs to be more fun - really I don&#8217;t. What is making it more fun going to do - hey look ma a custom avi. Hey Apple how about making the search thing actually work well so the same forking questions don&#8217;t come up 9,559,394 times?</p>

<p>Plus - that &#8220;social&#8221; crap is so yesterday in terms of time wasting while goofing off at work. Yea it&#8217;s good for some people&#8217;s &#8220;business&#8221; but really - most people are not producing product and selling it, most are just goofing off and are potential consumers that are &#8220;socializing&#8221;. If you want to make a support forum more fun how about an alternate reality game interface like second life or something. You have to rob, cheat, and beat your way to the right answers or the people that know what they are doing? Then the have nots will have to work harder than the &#8220;haves&#8221;. Now that would be cool. And instead of reputation points - let&#8217;s have your cert tests on-line when registering for a community. Then everyone can get little dunder-head or brain-surgeon badges on their avi.</p>

<p>Hmmm. Maybe just have one of your cronies update the FAQ every month or so?</p>

No there really isn&#8217;t a bunch of new stuff up there yet but there will be and I thought I would lay the groundwork for a more, hmmm, graphical experience.</p>

<p>I am far too lazy to go back through what seems like 200,584 posts and make all the required image changes and layout changes to look pretty but I have tested and everything should still work - it may not look great but going forward I hope to provide a more atheistically pleasing experience to all of you loyal readers and friends out there in internet-land.</p>

<p>If you have trouble please let me know - if you don&#8217;t and want to let me know what you think of the new layout - please let me know what you think as well (you may hove to use your imagination a bit though - still a work in progress). To be honest, this was prompted not only by the boost in performance but also by a bunch of my friends/customers that I do visual work for teasing me about how &#8220;text-y&#8221; my site is.</p>

<p>Thanks for all your patience.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/LAP3736-cool2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2099" title="_LAP3736-cool" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/LAP3736-cool2-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300" /></a>If you like nature and travel photography <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/">check Les Picker out</a> - I just set up a blog/site for him about a week ago. It&#8217;s brand new so don&#8217;t expect a ton of past content but he has started regularly posting on the kind of stuff he is interested in. I helped him with batch uploading some old content just for testing and he has started putting new posts up. Right now he is traveling by plane, train, and automobile to remote areas of the Canadian Rockies, or the Yukon, or some such place that the temperature dips below 80 sometimes - In other words you will not find me there anytime before global warming does it&#8217;s work up there.</p>

<p>Long story short is - he is a good friend. I did all the design work for him since he can&#8217;t be bothered with such trivial technological crap - he is a fantastic photographer and if you are into the travel/landscape thing you may actually find some useful stuff over there.</p>

<p>This image at the top of the post is one of his - taken last winter/spring - when it was even colder up there. Some place like lake Mo-rain or some such place I have never heard of. Even I have to admit that the place looks like some sort of fantasy hallucination. The image is also a print that I am making for some of Les&#8217; print customers - yep he can&#8217;t be bothered making prints either - he has me do it. Too too busy traveling and making photos for that stuff.</p>

<p>Anyway - let me know what you think if you have a couple of seconds.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. He is a fellow Nikon shooter/Aperture user.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As many of you probably know I have &#8220;seen the light&#8221; and much prefer strait from camera photographs. It is probably in my nature and my aesthetic that I feel that way but I needed a long stint as a commercial shooter to really jar me into the disdain that I have for most images that deluge us every day. For commercial purposes only - I say have at it, you must produce what your paying clients want to pay for but that is where it ends for me. I have no ill will for photographers that need to make a living with &#8220;illustrations&#8221;. That is what I consider most images today that claim to be photographs.</p>

<p>Fact of the matter is that most photographers that have been doing this photography thing for more than 10 minutes feel the same way - that is if they love photography and it is not JUST a means to produce income. Talk to some - regardless of what they do to make a living - the majority that I know like strait photos for many many reasons.</p>

<p>I<a href="http://www.10000words.net/2009/05/10-news-photos-that-took-photoshop-too/"> ran across this article today on journalistic photos</a> that took the post-production way way too far. Half of them you can see why the photographer that &#8220;took it too far&#8221; did what they did. The other half you have to ask yourself WHY OH WHY IN THE NAME OF GOD did he/she do that? I mean you can see the impact and understand the herd/train, the soldier/hand, even the fireman/sunset (although that is questionable in a &#8220;news&#8221; image) - the rest of them are why, why, why? Please why? They are not photographs anymore, they are illustrations and add NOTHING, they actually subtract from the value - even without &#8220;knowing&#8221; about the fakery - most of them are obvious - buy why??????????????</p>

<p>Keep this in mind before running the next step in your processing on your own personal photographs.</p>
