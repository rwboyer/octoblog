  <div class="entry-content"><p>In response to an email I am writing a fairly objective post regarding things that still suck about digital capture here today in 2011. First of all let me say that a lot of my love affair with film is completely biased, emotional, and somewhat irrational. I know that - so what.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Post processing - I try to avoid it like the plague. It is a drag. Without post most digital looks like shit compared to the way film looks out of the can. Of course you can say &#8216;well film needs a guy to print and color correct it and that&#8217;s post.&#8221; Yea but that&#8217;s not quite true - slides  look fantastic without that crap. A response could be.. &#8220;well just hire a guy to do all that with your digital&#8221;. Okay so there goes the &#8220;cost&#8221; benefit of digital in a big big way.</li>
    <li>Time - digital may be quick to turn around but it sucks down way more time than analog ever did for me. Especially as a commercial photographer.</li>
    <li>Highlights still render badly - really badly. Unless of course you go through amazing amounts of contortions both while shooting and in post. Trust me on this. I process prints for a couple of guys who know what they are doing and the specular highlights look like shit when printed large. No way around it. You could say &#8216;well the brand new leaf  and phase one stuff is fantastic&#8221; Ummmm, yea but they are still not as good as film in rendering of highlights. They do have great dynamic range but they still suck on that highlight edge and who the hell wants to spend major bucks on a that just to compete with very very cheap film? Are you on crack?</li>
    <li>Leaves suck on most digital depending on the magnification ratio. Lots of leaves at small magnification - in other words a high spacial frequency on the image sensor and they look like absolute garbage in the way they render. I am sure I could work out the why but I really don&#8217;t care. If you &#8220;ring the bell&#8221;  by going over some threshold on fine detail / spacial frequency you get dog shit with digital. Seems to be some sort of edge function with a bad transition and graceful falloff into nothingsville. Really good image makers have known this kind of thing for 100 years in terms of image appearance vs some arbitrary &#8220;numbers&#8221; hence the selection of lenses etc. that looked good vs &#8220;better&#8221;.</li>
    <li>Color that is not pleasing - loud yes - pleasing no. Oh and really horrible skin unless you put a ton of time into it on the back end.</li>
    <li>The amount of time and expense on the constant upgrade treadmill for gear, computers, software, on and on. Yea you can try to opt out but it will not work for long - you have no choice. Sticking with old digital (say 5 years at the absolute limit) will eventually result in a circumstance where you CANNOT shoot or process images. Think you can really run Photoshop 6 on your powermac G4 and continue shooting your D1x? Yea right. If anything goes wrong with any piece of that chain you are done with zero options. Got a new camera - still using and old version of PS - welcome to the upgrades. This really sucks but is part of all things digital. Everything in every part of your digital life is not only disposable, it costs a ton if you don&#8217;t proactively refresh and renew. One way or another computers/software/digital devices are a giant money pit. Fantastic if you are making a ton of money - not so good if you are not.</li>
    <li>Paraphernalia on trips - I am sick of the cords, chargers, batteries, etc, etc. What a drag.</li>
    <li>I can mathematically prove that digital sucks using a combination of logic and my acute rationalization skills that you have seen at work with buying stuff I don&#8217;t need. I will just use them in reverse. Here goes. Anything that can be improved radically so quickly must completely and undoubtedly suck - right? If it were actually any good it would take more time and the improvement would be subtle - right? Now we all know that next year every piece of gear that can possibly buy right now will completely suck ACCORDING to every one on the internet, all reviewers, all testers, AND the PEOPLE THAT made the stuff. Let&#8217;s assume that is true - hey your old digital stuff sucks doesn&#8217;t it? If we go with this line of thought then anything digital you can possibly buy right now completely and utterly sucks.</li>
    <li>Digital is in NO way &#8220;greener&#8221; than film - NO F&#8217;ing way. The all in resource cost for all this disposable crap in addition to the power requirements of storage display distribution is probably 2 orders of magnitude greater than shooting/processing/printing of film.</li>
    <li>The packaging for film is really really nice and a joy to behold - the packaging for CF cards etc is that horrible plastic have to hurt yourself to get it open style of nonsense.</li>
</ol>


<p>For those that don&#8217;t quite get my humor - this list is interspersed with absolutes and sarcasm but I am quite serious about what still sucks about digital. By all means shoot whatever floats your boat or makes you money. I shoot both if you can&#8217;t tell - I really never have been all about what particular image capture method or media is &#8220;better&#8221; be it 35, 120, various sheet sizes, digital, on and on. I can tell you that I happen to enjoy the analog materials and process immensely and do evangelize a bit on either experiencing it for the first time or revisiting every once in a while.</p>

<p>Here is some food for thought - this image (yes it is just stupid crap) was shot on that roll of 10 year out of date Kodak 160 Portra VC in my 50 year old Leica just to see what would happen and how &#8220;bad it was&#8221; It was then processed and scanned at the local drugstore for six bucks at 8bit low res by an untrained glue sniffing teen that has NO idea what film should look like, nor cares. You will have to believe me when I say that the Highlights don&#8217;t suck, the skin tones don&#8217;t suck, and the color don&#8217;t suck right out of the box. I may actually scan these negs myself and show you in painstaking detail why all of the above do not suck with NO screwing around.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You guys are insatiable - no sooner than I hit the post button on &#8220;what sucks about digital&#8221; and someone wants to know &#8220;hey - what do you mean digi-cam skin tones suck?&#8221;.  Hmmmm, well, It&#8217;s kinda hard to explain and I really don&#8217;t have anything cooked up to &#8220;prove&#8221; it, I am lazy, but I do happen to have the folder of that 10 year expired drug store processed Kodak Portra 160VC sitting here so&#8230;.</p>

<p>Two random shots with skin EXACTLY how they came back from the lab scanned at crappy resolution, with too much compression, a teenage delinquent operator,  and in 8bit. The funny thing is you can still tell what I mean about skin&#8230;</p>

<p>Exhibit #1 Daughter #2 (don&#8217;t tell her about this - she wasn&#8217;t exactly prepared for pictures, this is her fisherman barbie look)</p>

<p>Now let&#8217;s not go into how not so great the images are as stand alone works of art but if you have a monitor that is even close to color correct and get get even remotely close to displaying sRGB you should be able to tell what the heck I am talking about. Now&#8230; You should see them with a calibrated scan - what a joy. Can you get good skin in digital - yea sure it just takes a lot more to get there. Kodak has been figuring out how to render caucasian skin for 100 years. The really cool thing is that Kodak and Fuji both have films that are optimized for skin tones - same church, different pew. Want some subtle but noticeable variations? just switch to Fuji&#8217;s wedding films. No fuss, no muss just great looking skin - think it&#8217;s some sort of &#8220;trick&#8221; - go look at Jose Villa&#8217;s portfolio or any other shooter that still shoots on color neg - you will notice an amazing similarity in the way skin is rendered from a color, highlight gradation, etc, etc.</p>

<p>For the techno-geek - this was shot on a Leica M with 50mm Summicron - I guess this would be a reasonable example of &#8220;The leica look&#8221; in terms of the way the focus fall off looks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have this photographer buddy. He travels to the ends of the earth to make really nice landscape photographs. He gets up way way before sunrise, treks to a remote location on foot. He carries 53.2 metric tons of DSLR gear, lenses, and &#8220;really wrong stuff&#8221; gadgets to cover any eventuality. He sets up on the tripod, carefullllllllly composes the shot. Carefullllly meters the scene. He tilts, he shifts, examines focus with a focusing magnifier. He has an arsenal of the finest filters to properly filter the scene to make sure the sky isn&#8217;t too brignt. Then he waits, and waits, and waits some more.</p>

<p>Finally the light is coming. Ooooops the clouds are not right. Well well take some shots and come back tomorrow. You know that I can&#8217;t do this - I have the attention span of a gnat but thats what you do if you want landscapes that are actually good. From my point of view this is THE PERSON that has the patience and the NEED to shoot large format film. Heck he&#8217;s doing all the &#8220;hard&#8221; work already. The same exact stuff you need to do with a view camera. The only thing he&#8217;s not doing is carrying a lighter camera bag with LESS stuff.</p>

<p>Over the past year or so I have been half-jokingly teasing him about shooting 4x5 like real photographers do. The only downside is that he spends a couple bucks on a box of film and processing. Oh, and the fact that if a bear shows up he&#8217;s not equipped to shoot it instead of the mountain lake. So what - use a digicam point and shoot for that - or go on a wildlife trip or something.</p>

<p>Can you guess what he did yesterday??? He bought a newer, nice, wood 4x5 field camera and two german made, modern, multicoated, state of the art Schneider/Rodenstock lenses as well as the accompanying paraphernalia - all for about $1000.</p>

<p>One of two things is going to happen. He&#8217;s going to love it and never look back - gone is the digital distractions and the mob mentality and the countless little anxiety inducing worries of &#8220;damn I wish I was shooting the new D3-triple-x&#8221;. The other thing that could happen is I end up with a permanent installation of some very nice german glass in my backside.</p>

<p>Wish him luck - Wish me luck, I did promise to do his proof scanning for a year as an incentive. I will link to his ongoing endeavors as soon as some shots are up and live.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. All it takes is l<a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=4x5+velvia&amp;m=&amp;s=int">ooking through a few pages of this</a> to KNOW I am pushing him in the right direction for what he does. My very first test shot with my 1930&#8217;s funky-o-matic™ lens with a chip out of the front wide open with not particularly careful focus or handling&#8230;.</p>

<p>and of course you know the drill - here is &#8220;100%&#8221; from a 1200 dpi scan or approx 12x magnification, or 5 foot wide print if you open it on your screen.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just so you guys think I am not totally off my rocker here I did want to tell you that I do still think &#8220;digital&#8221; is great to. For instance - the following shot is an illustration I cranked out in about 2 seconds without even thinking about it using my lovely <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WJR69E?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003WJR69E">Panasoic LX5</a> (aka Leica DLUX-5). As I have said before this little guy is AMAZING.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/P1010059.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/P1010059.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>I shot this off the cuff and had it ready to go in less than a minute from capture to publish. I absolutely love that about digital. It certainly has it&#8217;s place in the world of photography. I mean come on - This is truly amazing - the shot sucks but look at how easy it was and from a technical standpoint it&#8217;s sharp and well exposed with not a lot of noise at ISO 500 f 2.0 handheld without a lot of care at 1/8 second. I didn&#8217;t do a thing - the camera set the ISO, along with everything else including choosing the focus point to use. The only thing I did was to hold the camera near the floor tilt it a little, choose the focal length of 24mm and press the button. Tell me that isn&#8217;t fantastic image stabilization built right in.</p>

<p>I shot this as a quick illustration to answer a question of &#8220;Do I still print&#8221; as in wet prints in the darkroom. The answer is yes. I have piles of rejected work prints like this all over the place as well has some that have not hit the reject pile yet that I am &#8220;living with&#8221; No matter how you capture I do believe that printing and seeing your images on paper is an essential part of the photographic process and experience. I make digital prints to - they just cost a hell of a lot more. These things are a few cents each and a little bit of my time.</p>

<p>Now here is the rub with digital capture in many cases and especially with sensor sizes smaller than 35mm. This camera can shoot in just about any mode you can imagine and has what I would consider reasonably good controls to do so. The problem is that it is way harder and slower to use even these okay controls than say my Nikon F3 or Leica M6 or my Hasselblad, all of  which have very limited options while making a shot. To add insult to injury those controls don&#8217;t do much when you select differently - This is wide open and focused pretty close - can you see exactly where the focus point is? How about that blur in the foreground or background - oooops no blur or not a whole lot. So why bother. Same goes for small aperture zooms on larger formats.</p>

<p>Couple that with 700 other distractions up to and including color treatment, special effects, aspect ratio, etc, etc and you end up with one big distraction - oh yea and you can make a movie to. An amazing image capture device but absolutely NOT the optimum solution to make any specific type of image. Hell yea I am going to take this thing with me no matter where I am and what camera I bring to make a specific type of image. Will I use it when I am working on a project where I have a very specific end look in mind - No.</p>

<p>I guess the reason I have been talking so much about classic cameras and film of late is do to the fact that I think a lot of these traditional devices and materials are far better at producing a specific type of image with a specific look while clearing out all the mental clutter and focusing on the subject. I find this true for myself. I have proved it over and over again. Of course they are less than optimal if you have NO idea what you are trying to do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The smacked ass UPS driver delivered Nikon F3 No. 6 to a house down the road from me. Luckily I have honest neighbors. We&#8217;ll let them continue to look, the sender/seller and myself as punishment.</p>

<p>I did discover three interesting things over the last two days. Winter makes me a bit touchy and irritable, the seller of F3 No. 6 is a real photography nut case like us (I will be posting some of his very interesting work soon), and I have both types of Nikon F3&#8217;s. Both types being the HP finder and the non-HP finder. They have numbers like DE-3 and DE-2 or some such Nikon code. The HP version is of lower magnification, a little brighter, and you can see the whole thing with your eye farther away from it. The other kind has higher magnification - so may be a wee bit more accurate when focusing critically. Maybe not. So that begs the question - which kind do you guys want?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I hate UPS, I hate the general incompetence of people that are out there doing &#8220;jobs&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know what they are like in a one on one non-job like scenario but I do know that the state of affairs with 90+% of people that go to work in the morning, go home at night, and collect a paycheck for &#8220;doing some job&#8221; should not be employed at all. I am quite serious about this.</p>

<p>I believe most people do meaningless &#8220;jobs&#8221; in the sense that the &#8220;job&#8221; they do has no meaning or ownership by them and they really don&#8217;t give a fuck. Therefore they go about it with complete and utter incompetence. This maybe due to their own general incompetence at everything or maybe a by product of most jobs allowing NO degree of control or decision making on employee&#8217;s parts DUE to general incompetence so by operational procedure the company tries to minimize the damage. I have a great idea - fire the incompetent people and demand more for a paycheck. Not more time - just more care and better decisions no matter how inconsequential. Gee that was totally stupid and incompetent - you are fired.</p>

<p>Here is the end result - People that actually work at companies not only cause the issues but they are no more capable of doing ANYTHING to fix them or figure them out than I am via whatever limited means I am provided on the customer service website. Since this is the case fire them all - really. Give me the same shitty ass service and shitty ass incompetence with out the overhead of employing these fucking morons and give me a lower cost that more closely matches the value without the annoyance of talking to people that you pay to do NOTHING more than I can do using your website.</p>

<p>The 6th F3 allegedly showed up this morning at 10:47 HERE at my place according to the tracking number. Hmmmm - wrong. It was delivered to the &#8220;side door&#8221;. Hmmm nope. Okay let&#8217;s call at noon. &#8220;Sir did you check with your neighbors?&#8221;. Ahhh no but I can see all of their doors from where I am standing and none of them live here in the winter - no packages. &#8220;Well you might want to check with them.&#8221; But&#8230;. cut off. Grrrrrr. I walk outside and go to every hose that is anywhere near mine - no packages anywhere. Assholes. Call back and this time I am pretty mad - you see now i am doing UPS&#8217;s job for them. The bottom line is that an investigation needs to be opened but I can&#8217;t do that as I didn&#8217;t ship the item. Hmmm, you can&#8217;t just hit the submit button after you check the checkbox that says &#8220;start investigation&#8221;? Nope. Better yet - you knew exactly where it was, what office, what truck - that&#8217;s what the little barcode things are for you shithead. Call that fucking incompetent ass of a driver that is still in the neighborhood on his cell screwing with facebook and tell him he fucked up and fix it NOW. No&#8230; the person that shipped the item must go to the UPS store where it was shipped from so that they UPS store can check the checkbox to hit submit a fucking week from now.</p>

<p>Oh I have to fuck around for an hour or two and then the other guy has to fuck around for an hour or two so that somebody sitting next to you can check the checkbox days from now to look into it? Fire them, give me a lower cost. They are useless.</p>

<p>Bullshit fuck you - fuck you.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. The contest is still on I still have 5 Nikon F3&#8217;s.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I posted a CrappyWorkPrint™ of my normal StupidCrap™ test subjects a while ago and went on to explain some of the virtues of using a pyro developer. It seems that there was at least a tiny bit of interest in what the heck I was talking about. Probably more curiosity than practicality. Anyway I received a couple questions about what is what on that post and decide to synthesize the answers in to a few clarifications and a post.</p>

<p>Even if you are not interested in ever using a pyro film developer there might be a few things to think about here regarding the use of film (negative - not slide film) as well as a general method of operating when deciding what to do with some of your work - even digital.</p>

<p>First off here is a CrappyScan™ of the CrappyWorkPrint™ of my StupidCrap™</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Delta100-print1.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Delta100-print1.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>I shot this when testing one of the 9 or 10 year out of date Ilford Delta 100 in a box I unearthed from a long ago move. I knew it would make pictures but needed to understand it&#8217;s particular characteristics acquired after my very carefully uncontrolled aging process. Here is what I did.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Set my meter to ISO 50 as it had probably lost some speed. Just need to gauge how much.</li>
    <li>Shot random images of StupidCrap™ that were all over the map in terms of contrast and brightness ranges.</li>
    <li>Happend to be semi-interested in this particular eagle flying among the clouds. So I shot a couple of frames after doing some ill-concieved calculations that lead to me metering the sky and adding two stops of overexposure (Zone VII for you B+W guys).</li>
    <li>Now that is all fine and dandy if I were to develop the film somewhere close to normal contrast here tis the &#8220;but&#8221; - I finished the roll quickly and decided that the only images I cared about were kinda low contrast - like that sky in the image. It was kinda gray and flat visually. Hence I made the decision to develop the living crap out of it - somewhere around N+2 contrast (think two to three stop push in over development). Yea but I exposed it a stop over in the first place. Usually if you develop for higher contrast you want to under expose the film by a bit - like a stop or a little more for N+2. The sky will now go through the roof in terms of density.</li>
    <li>Let&#8217;s see what happened.</li>
</ul>


<p>Well the negative is very very very thick and there was a bit of fog from the age of the film that was exacerbated by the overdevelopment.  But guess what - the Pyro held detail in the sky, the overdevelopment boosted the contrast to a level where I could see detail that I didn&#8217;t even see with my eyes when shooting the image. Mind you that Pyro is in no way a fine grained developer - it&#8217;s more like Rodinal, very very sharp. The over development, the overall overexposure, and the fog contributed even more in the grain department but I will tell you from experience with a lot of materials that the amount of detail that is rendered and retained in those blasted out highlights (the entire SKY) is pretty amazing. That is what people mean when they talk about increased highlight detail - black and white film + pyro is amazing at doing this. It does not mean anything about where you decide to print these values - if you jamb them all up in the white of the paper you cannot see them. I decided I wanted to render the sky in the upper midtones so I could see what was going on. Hence I printed it very dark.</p>

<p>This is just a strait print so I can see what is going on in the image - when I print or am working on a project I usually take some of my favorite images and print them. Typically &#8220;strait&#8221; without a whole lot of special treatment. If I am unsure of two massively different variations I print them both - still really simple prints. I then live with them a little bit, like a week and make decisions about how I really want to treat them in terms of paper type - size - local adjustments - etc. Then I will make those and live with them for a while, in many cases I decide that I do not want to go any farther and those prints get filed away. The true gems are the prints that I can live with and find interesting over the course of time. Those are the ones that make it to a final printing stage for me.</p>

<p>I do the same thing when working on personal projects even if the end result is a book. I find that living with your images on paper - somewhere that you spend a lot of time consistently makes for a better edit of what&#8217;s in, what&#8217;s out, and what to do with a particular image that trying to do that in one shot or one session on the computer. I am very often surprised by what makes it to my final images. It&#8217;s way different than what I would have guessed at the beginning of the  process. One of the big things I do is I do not cut personal project image on the basis of technical crap - the only criteria is if I like it or I don&#8217;t.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the spirit of the Nikon F3 give-away I compiled my own little list of the top reasons I shoot film in 2011 and will shoot more of it than I did in 2010, which was more than 2009. Here goes, feel free to contribute or debate&#8230;</p>

<ol>
    <li>It&#8217;s a cheap luxury. There are sooo many things that cost way more to me and provide far less enjoyment. My coffee budget is more money, my cigarette budget is more, my online-bullcrap subscription budget is more, my car insurance is more, shooting film is really not a financial burden at all.</li>
    <li>It looks fantastic - really fantastic. The color is awesome and extremely hard if not impossible to reproduce from film to film and definitely close to impossible with digital.</li>
    <li>Really nice equipment from 35mm to medium format, to 8x10 and beyond for a song. Do not discount this. Right now may be the best time ever to acquire some seriously great gear. It&#8217;s starting to thin out based on my non-clinical view, especially the stuff that was not to plentiful EVER - prices are starting to reflect that. If you ever had a hankering you might not get a chance again. A great example is Medium format gear. It was not nearly as common as 35mm and some of the less common stuff like MF rangefinders (think Fuji 6x9 or Mamyia, or Bronica, etc) are starting to go WAY up compared to the past few years. Not just that but there are a couple of newly manufactured MF rangefinders that cost LESS than some of the old stuff but they don&#8217;t hold a candle to some of that older gear in a lot of ways. Same goes for the REALLY nice large format stuff.</li>
    <li>Unique and beautiful lenses that well never see the light of day in digital. Make no mistake photography is about how an image looks as a whole not about the specs of lens resolution etc. All new lenses designed for use with digital MUST use strange complicated and funky designs, they all must be highly tele-centric due to limitations in the way digital sensors work. Couple that with the consumer demand for ever smaller cameras, idiotic 1mm-20,000mm zoom, etc and you may get sharp but in many cases beautiful &#8220;rendition&#8221; is out the window. There are plenty of lenses I have myself that are technical home runs in terms of flare control, resolution, lack of CA, etc. that I just do not like the way they &#8220;look&#8221;.</li>
    <li>Shooting film takes less time in a lot of cases - I like darkroom work so that doesn&#8217;t apply to me. If you don&#8217;t send it get the files back you are DONE. Outsource your printing and you are DONE. I know a half a dozen wedding photographers that went back to film for just this reason. They are very very happy.</li>
    <li>Spend less time researching the next thing you are going to buy. Way less time. Shoot what camera feels good and you like - never worry about it again. I know pro travel photographers that spend way too much time even thought they don&#8217;t want to just dealing with the on-slaught of new camera shit they should or shouldn&#8217;t buy. Should I quick sell my Dxxx so I can end up net better on the $ for the Dxxx2s? Yea this should enter into the equations, right.</li>
    <li>In an age where differentiation is a full time job take the easy way out. &#8220;I shoot film&#8221; is potentially a HUGE differentiator. Should customers care? No but they do care, personally I don&#8217;t buy into their rationale in  a lot of cases but since I agree with where that leads&#8230; So be it. Yea I know you don&#8217;t have the attention span to actually tell the difference and you are half color blind and couldn&#8217;t tell a Gaussian blur from a shallow depth of field but you think film is &#8220;retro cool&#8221; you can tell your friends - great I am into it. You laugh? I know portrait photographers that have gone back to film and large format film just for the &#8220;marketing hype&#8221; and because they like it and their business has BOOOOMED because they standout from the rest of the yo-yo&#8217;s competing with underselling Walmart. They work less, charge more, and have a higher end clientele - that is every senior portrait/child/wedding photographers goal.</li>
    <li>Better quality - less gear to lug around - cheaper - quicker. Not in all cases but certainly in some. Let&#8217;s take the &#8220;serious&#8221; landscape photographer. What are you going to take with you to photograph the exotic and remote landscape? 2 pro DSLR bodies, 3 pro large aperture zooms, a couple of tilt-shfit lenses, a tripod for sure, filters, memory cards, laptop and associated bullshit. I will assure you that one 4x5 field camera,tripod,filters, and 3 tiny little lenses will do the job with one or two boxes of film at lower bulk lower weight smaller kit, and no electrical requirements. Quality - you are kidding right no contest here. Investment cost - do we really need to discuss this? Oh what about time? You must be kidding - the SAME with less to do on the backend in post. Landscape guys do the tripod thing, the careful meter thing, the filter thing, the wait thing - all the time is in prep and the wait. Enjoy more, carry less, get better quality that digital cannot even dream of, hmmmm.</li>
    <li>Never ever having to say &#8220;I wish I shot this on film&#8221; or &#8220;I wish I had a D3x or a D4 or whatever&#8221;.</li>
    <li>Most importantly - sustain the small but very important film market that exists. Even if you only shoot with your iPhone - do you really want to see film go away. The Kodachrome thing was a real shame and for the first time in a very long time it is now completely impossible to use it at all. You cannot do it yourself - K14 processing is not something you could EVER do yourself. You can make a tin-type or a wet plate but you cannot do Kodachrome even if you have a lifetime supply of it. Personally I don&#8217;t know anyone that would want that to continue to happen to film products as a whole. Shoot even a little bit and if lives. I personally plan to shoot E100G, Velvia, and for the first time this year Ektar 100 in multiple formats. I have not personally shot color for way too long because I don&#8217;t care as much about color for my personal work. For too long it has been digital color for me because I don&#8217;t care. I do care about black and white. This year, 2011, I am going to shoot at least half of my color &#8220;don&#8217;t care&#8221; work on the mentioned color films. You see , I don&#8217;t care now but I know I will care later.</li>
</ol>
