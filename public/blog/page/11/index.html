  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been a little sparse lately but I&#8217;m still alive. Just wanted to take a few seconds to update all of you on a few topics near and dear. First off - The Nikon F3 give-away is about a week away and on track. I finally have selected which of my Nikon F3&#8217;s will be sent out to a somewhat lucky photographer that posted a comment on <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/02/06/nikon-f3-give-away/">the give-away thread</a>. As mentioned I was going to select one that I don&#8217;t use but no too too pretty. I have landed on one that is free of major cosmetic damage (not that it matters much to the function), has an HP finder so it&#8217;s not too ancient, and appears to have NO impairments or quirks in function at all.</p>

<p>The only &#8220;issue&#8221; with it is that like so so many F3&#8217;s it&#8217;s missing screw-in plain glass eye piece on the back of the finder. This is not really something functional but the winner will probably want to grab one on eBay just to make it perfect. Little known fact&#8230; I believe ANY round finder Nikon eye piece made after the F3 HP will work fine so don&#8217;t get hung up on getting one for &#8220;the F3HP&#8221;. The old DE-2 F3 finder eye piece will NOT work. Heck buy a used N8008 or something like 5 bucks - maybe cheaper. Keep your eye&#8217;s peeled - end of next week we will have a winner. What should I giveaway next?</p>

<p>Another update - remember that GIANT print I was helping to make? Well it&#8217;s done and looks fantastic - it&#8217;s somewhere over 5 FEET x 8 FEET - the photographer and I decided to go the cheap route and make the image into a triptych that is 3 pieces and it turned out great. We install it into the restaurant sometime before the end of March - I will give you guys an image of what the install looks like and details on what we used to do it if you are interested.</p>

<p>One other note&#8230; Somehow in the middle of my annual winter depression, I am getting inspired to do a bit more real photography crap in 2011. Part of that may be some actual scheduled workshops. I am kinda not real fond of doing what I have done in the past - namely focusing on just studio lighting, nor just people, nor just technical stuff, nor just work-flow. I am kinda thinking of doing something end to end that might encompass a mini-project that combines shooting the subject AND the post work-flow rather than just one or the other. Any thoughts? Oh and it will involve shooting some sort of people NOT landscape/still life etc as I find that mind-numbing and tooooo dependent on weather conditions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>No doubt about it, we humans tend to become &#8220;conditioned&#8221;, &#8220;trained&#8221;, and downright programmed in certain ways no matter if we try not to or not. You can do mental exercises all you want to gain a fresh perspective but no matter what there will be remnants of whatever you used to do built in to your &#8220;new&#8221; way. Those remnants can be subtle or not so subtle but they will be there. They will probably never go away even if you concentrate hard of making them do so. Of course you can develop new stuff as well but some of the old stuff will still be there flavoring the new stuff for better or worse.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s take a couple of examples that I am extremely familiar with. Lens focal length being the first. I grew up on prime lenses. First off because that&#8217;s all I had when I started and what I tended to gravitate to in the early 80&#8217;s. When I got a new camera system, the hasselblad, there was ONE zoom lens that was horribly expensive and continued to shoot with a very common trio. A 50, 80, 150 trio to be specific - a little different than my 35mm stuff but not too too much different.</p>

<p>Somewhere along the way I picked up my first zoom lens - a Nikon 28-70 F2.8 AFS. Big heavy and the only thing it had going for it was that it focused very very fast compared to the non-AFS primes I had. I still have that lens and it is still very good but without fail I use it like two lenses that I can change very very quickly. On a full-frame body it is a 28 and a 70. Sort of a wide and sorta-normalish. On a DX body it&#8217;s a normal and a short tele. I can tell you from hundreds of thousands of images in Aperture that it is always at 28 or 70 and nowhere in between.</p>

<p>When I think about that after having the indisputable evidence of the EXIF in my face, I can see myself wracking the zoom ring and then moving my position by increments back and forth for framing vs. using any zoom adjustment. Heck I still use my Panasonic LX5 the same way - it&#8217;s a camera with a 24 and a 90 unless I think about it real real hard and set it to something in between. I am not saying it&#8217;s good or bad but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going away. Contrast this to the person that grew up on zooms. I see them all the time. They bring the camera to their eye and fiddle with the zoom to frame.</p>

<p>So what, you may ask. Well, I guess the point is somewhat tangential to a few things I have been harping on for sometime under the guise of shooting film. Specifically about shooting simple cameras that were par for the course in the film era. Want to gain some perspective into your shooting? Maybe change it up a bit? Shoot a different camera with a different medium like film that operates with a completely different set of rules. A couple of things my happen from this exercise. First you may get really frustrated. Second you may uncover some conditioning that you didn&#8217;t even realize you had when you are forced to operate differently. Third if you stick with it for long enough you may develop some new habits that will bleed over to other equipment you choose to use that will inform your process and possibly your images down the road.</p>

<p>Just something to think about on a windy crappy Saturday - well at least where I am on the planet at this moment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In response to an email I am writing a fairly objective post regarding things that still suck about digital capture here today in 2011. First of all let me say that a lot of my love affair with film is completely biased, emotional, and somewhat irrational. I know that - so what.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Post processing - I try to avoid it like the plague. It is a drag. Without post most digital looks like shit compared to the way film looks out of the can. Of course you can say &#8216;well film needs a guy to print and color correct it and that&#8217;s post.&#8221; Yea but that&#8217;s not quite true - slides  look fantastic without that crap. A response could be.. &#8220;well just hire a guy to do all that with your digital&#8221;. Okay so there goes the &#8220;cost&#8221; benefit of digital in a big big way.</li>
    <li>Time - digital may be quick to turn around but it sucks down way more time than analog ever did for me. Especially as a commercial photographer.</li>
    <li>Highlights still render badly - really badly. Unless of course you go through amazing amounts of contortions both while shooting and in post. Trust me on this. I process prints for a couple of guys who know what they are doing and the specular highlights look like shit when printed large. No way around it. You could say &#8216;well the brand new leaf  and phase one stuff is fantastic&#8221; Ummmm, yea but they are still not as good as film in rendering of highlights. They do have great dynamic range but they still suck on that highlight edge and who the hell wants to spend major bucks on a that just to compete with very very cheap film? Are you on crack?</li>
    <li>Leaves suck on most digital depending on the magnification ratio. Lots of leaves at small magnification - in other words a high spacial frequency on the image sensor and they look like absolute garbage in the way they render. I am sure I could work out the why but I really don&#8217;t care. If you &#8220;ring the bell&#8221;  by going over some threshold on fine detail / spacial frequency you get dog shit with digital. Seems to be some sort of edge function with a bad transition and graceful falloff into nothingsville. Really good image makers have known this kind of thing for 100 years in terms of image appearance vs some arbitrary &#8220;numbers&#8221; hence the selection of lenses etc. that looked good vs &#8220;better&#8221;.</li>
    <li>Color that is not pleasing - loud yes - pleasing no. Oh and really horrible skin unless you put a ton of time into it on the back end.</li>
    <li>The amount of time and expense on the constant upgrade treadmill for gear, computers, software, on and on. Yea you can try to opt out but it will not work for long - you have no choice. Sticking with old digital (say 5 years at the absolute limit) will eventually result in a circumstance where you CANNOT shoot or process images. Think you can really run Photoshop 6 on your powermac G4 and continue shooting your D1x? Yea right. If anything goes wrong with any piece of that chain you are done with zero options. Got a new camera - still using and old version of PS - welcome to the upgrades. This really sucks but is part of all things digital. Everything in every part of your digital life is not only disposable, it costs a ton if you don&#8217;t proactively refresh and renew. One way or another computers/software/digital devices are a giant money pit. Fantastic if you are making a ton of money - not so good if you are not.</li>
    <li>Paraphernalia on trips - I am sick of the cords, chargers, batteries, etc, etc. What a drag.</li>
    <li>I can mathematically prove that digital sucks using a combination of logic and my acute rationalization skills that you have seen at work with buying stuff I don&#8217;t need. I will just use them in reverse. Here goes. Anything that can be improved radically so quickly must completely and undoubtedly suck - right? If it were actually any good it would take more time and the improvement would be subtle - right? Now we all know that next year every piece of gear that can possibly buy right now will completely suck ACCORDING to every one on the internet, all reviewers, all testers, AND the PEOPLE THAT made the stuff. Let&#8217;s assume that is true - hey your old digital stuff sucks doesn&#8217;t it? If we go with this line of thought then anything digital you can possibly buy right now completely and utterly sucks.</li>
    <li>Digital is in NO way &#8220;greener&#8221; than film - NO F&#8217;ing way. The all in resource cost for all this disposable crap in addition to the power requirements of storage display distribution is probably 2 orders of magnitude greater than shooting/processing/printing of film.</li>
    <li>The packaging for film is really really nice and a joy to behold - the packaging for CF cards etc is that horrible plastic have to hurt yourself to get it open style of nonsense.</li>
</ol>


<p>For those that don&#8217;t quite get my humor - this list is interspersed with absolutes and sarcasm but I am quite serious about what still sucks about digital. By all means shoot whatever floats your boat or makes you money. I shoot both if you can&#8217;t tell - I really never have been all about what particular image capture method or media is &#8220;better&#8221; be it 35, 120, various sheet sizes, digital, on and on. I can tell you that I happen to enjoy the analog materials and process immensely and do evangelize a bit on either experiencing it for the first time or revisiting every once in a while.</p>

<p>Here is some food for thought - this image (yes it is just stupid crap) was shot on that roll of 10 year out of date Kodak 160 Portra VC in my 50 year old Leica just to see what would happen and how &#8220;bad it was&#8221; It was then processed and scanned at the local drugstore for six bucks at 8bit low res by an untrained glue sniffing teen that has NO idea what film should look like, nor cares. You will have to believe me when I say that the Highlights don&#8217;t suck, the skin tones don&#8217;t suck, and the color don&#8217;t suck right out of the box. I may actually scan these negs myself and show you in painstaking detail why all of the above do not suck with NO screwing around.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You guys are insatiable - no sooner than I hit the post button on &#8220;what sucks about digital&#8221; and someone wants to know &#8220;hey - what do you mean digi-cam skin tones suck?&#8221;.  Hmmmm, well, It&#8217;s kinda hard to explain and I really don&#8217;t have anything cooked up to &#8220;prove&#8221; it, I am lazy, but I do happen to have the folder of that 10 year expired drug store processed Kodak Portra 160VC sitting here so&#8230;.</p>

<p>Two random shots with skin EXACTLY how they came back from the lab scanned at crappy resolution, with too much compression, a teenage delinquent operator,  and in 8bit. The funny thing is you can still tell what I mean about skin&#8230;</p>

<p>Exhibit #1 Daughter #2 (don&#8217;t tell her about this - she wasn&#8217;t exactly prepared for pictures, this is her fisherman barbie look)</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;03700001&#8221; size=&#8221;medium&#8221; id=&#8221;2869&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/03700001.jpg&#8221; ]</p>

<p>Exhibit #2 Daughter #3</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;03700009&#8221; size=&#8221;medium&#8221; id=&#8221;2871&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/03700009.jpg&#8221; ]</p>

<p>Now let&#8217;s not go into how not so great the images are as stand alone works of art but if you have a monitor that is even close to color correct and get get even remotely close to displaying sRGB you should be able to tell what the heck I am talking about. Now&#8230; You should see them with a calibrated scan - what a joy. Can you get good skin in digital - yea sure it just takes a lot more to get there. Kodak has been figuring out how to render caucasian skin for 100 years. The really cool thing is that Kodak and Fuji both have films that are optimized for skin tones - same church, different pew. Want some subtle but noticeable variations? just switch to Fuji&#8217;s wedding films. No fuss, no muss just great looking skin - think it&#8217;s some sort of &#8220;trick&#8221; - go look at Jose Villa&#8217;s portfolio or any other shooter that still shoots on color neg - you will notice an amazing similarity in the way skin is rendered from a color, highlight gradation, etc, etc.</p>

<p>For the techno-geek - this was shot on a Leica M with 50mm Summicron - I guess this would be a reasonable example of &#8220;The leica look&#8221; in terms of the way the focus fall off looks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have this photographer buddy. He travels to the ends of the earth to make really nice landscape photographs. He gets up way way before sunrise, treks to a remote location on foot. He carries 53.2 metric tons of DSLR gear, lenses, and &#8220;really wrong stuff&#8221; gadgets to cover any eventuality. He sets up on the tripod, carefullllllllly composes the shot. Carefullllly meters the scene. He tilts, he shifts, examines focus with a focusing magnifier. He has an arsenal of the finest filters to properly filter the scene to make sure the sky isn&#8217;t too brignt. Then he waits, and waits, and waits some more.</p>

<p>Finally the light is coming. Ooooops the clouds are not right. Well well take some shots and come back tomorrow. You know that I can&#8217;t do this - I have the attention span of a gnat but thats what you do if you want landscapes that are actually good. From my point of view this is THE PERSON that has the patience and the NEED to shoot large format film. Heck he&#8217;s doing all the &#8220;hard&#8221; work already. The same exact stuff you need to do with a view camera. The only thing he&#8217;s not doing is carrying a lighter camera bag with LESS stuff.</p>

<p>Over the past year or so I have been half-jokingly teasing him about shooting 4x5 like real photographers do. The only downside is that he spends a couple bucks on a box of film and processing. Oh, and the fact that if a bear shows up he&#8217;s not equipped to shoot it instead of the mountain lake. So what - use a digicam point and shoot for that - or go on a wildlife trip or something.</p>

<p>Can you guess what he did yesterday??? He bought a newer, nice, wood 4x5 field camera and two german made, modern, multicoated, state of the art Schneider/Rodenstock lenses as well as the accompanying paraphernalia - all for about $1000.</p>

<p>One of two things is going to happen. He&#8217;s going to love it and never look back - gone is the digital distractions and the mob mentality and the countless little anxiety inducing worries of &#8220;damn I wish I was shooting the new D3-triple-x&#8221;. The other thing that could happen is I end up with a permanent installation of some very nice german glass in my backside.</p>

<p>Wish him luck - Wish me luck, I did promise to do his proof scanning for a year as an incentive. I will link to his ongoing endeavors as soon as some shots are up and live.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. All it takes is l<a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=4x5+velvia&amp;m=&amp;s=int">ooking through a few pages of this</a> to KNOW I am pushing him in the right direction for what he does. My very first test shot with my 1930&#8217;s funky-o-matic™ lens with a chip out of the front wide open with not particularly careful focus or handling&#8230;.</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;2009-0003-1200dpi_7&#8221; size=&#8221;large&#8221; id=&#8221;2861&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>and of course you know the drill - here is &#8220;100%&#8221; from a 1200 dpi scan or approx 12x magnification, or 5 foot wide print if you open it on your screen.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just so you guys think I am not totally off my rocker here I did want to tell you that I do still think &#8220;digital&#8221; is great to. For instance - the following shot is an illustration I cranked out in about 2 seconds without even thinking about it using my lovely <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WJR69E?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003WJR69E">Panasoic LX5</a> (aka Leica DLUX-5). As I have said before this little guy is AMAZING.</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;P1010059&#8221; size=&#8221;full&#8221; id=&#8221;2851&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>I shot this off the cuff and had it ready to go in less than a minute from capture to publish. I absolutely love that about digital. It certainly has it&#8217;s place in the world of photography. I mean come on - This is truly amazing - the shot sucks but look at how easy it was and from a technical standpoint it&#8217;s sharp and well exposed with not a lot of noise at ISO 500 f 2.0 handheld without a lot of care at 1/8 second. I didn&#8217;t do a thing - the camera set the ISO, along with everything else including choosing the focus point to use. The only thing I did was to hold the camera near the floor tilt it a little, choose the focal length of 24mm and press the button. Tell me that isn&#8217;t fantastic image stabilization built right in.</p>

<p>I shot this as a quick illustration to answer a question of &#8220;Do I still print&#8221; as in wet prints in the darkroom. The answer is yes. I have piles of rejected work prints like this all over the place as well has some that have not hit the reject pile yet that I am &#8220;living with&#8221; No matter how you capture I do believe that printing and seeing your images on paper is an essential part of the photographic process and experience. I make digital prints to - they just cost a hell of a lot more. These things are a few cents each and a little bit of my time.</p>

<p>Now here is the rub with digital capture in many cases and especially with sensor sizes smaller than 35mm. This camera can shoot in just about any mode you can imagine and has what I would consider reasonably good controls to do so. The problem is that it is way harder and slower to use even these okay controls than say my Nikon F3 or Leica M6 or my Hasselblad, all of  which have very limited options while making a shot. To add insult to injury those controls don&#8217;t do much when you select differently - This is wide open and focused pretty close - can you see exactly where the focus point is? How about that blur in the foreground or background - oooops no blur or not a whole lot. So why bother. Same goes for small aperture zooms on larger formats.</p>

<p>Couple that with 700 other distractions up to and including color treatment, special effects, aspect ratio, etc, etc and you end up with one big distraction - oh yea and you can make a movie to. An amazing image capture device but absolutely NOT the optimum solution to make any specific type of image. Hell yea I am going to take this thing with me no matter where I am and what camera I bring to make a specific type of image. Will I use it when I am working on a project where I have a very specific end look in mind - No.</p>

<p>I guess the reason I have been talking so much about classic cameras and film of late is do to the fact that I think a lot of these traditional devices and materials are far better at producing a specific type of image with a specific look while clearing out all the mental clutter and focusing on the subject. I find this true for myself. I have proved it over and over again. Of course they are less than optimal if you have NO idea what you are trying to do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The smacked ass UPS driver delivered Nikon F3 No. 6 to a house down the road from me. Luckily I have honest neighbors. We&#8217;ll let them continue to look, the sender/seller and myself as punishment.</p>

<p>I did discover three interesting things over the last two days. Winter makes me a bit touchy and irritable, the seller of F3 No. 6 is a real photography nut case like us (I will be posting some of his very interesting work soon), and I have both types of Nikon F3&#8217;s. Both types being the HP finder and the non-HP finder. They have numbers like DE-3 and DE-2 or some such Nikon code. The HP version is of lower magnification, a little brighter, and you can see the whole thing with your eye farther away from it. The other kind has higher magnification - so may be a wee bit more accurate when focusing critically. Maybe not. So that begs the question - which kind do you guys want?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I hate UPS, I hate the general incompetence of people that are out there doing &#8220;jobs&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know what they are like in a one on one non-job like scenario but I do know that the state of affairs with 90+% of people that go to work in the morning, go home at night, and collect a paycheck for &#8220;doing some job&#8221; should not be employed at all. I am quite serious about this.</p>

<p>I believe most people do meaningless &#8220;jobs&#8221; in the sense that the &#8220;job&#8221; they do has no meaning or ownership by them and they really don&#8217;t give a fuck. Therefore they go about it with complete and utter incompetence. This maybe due to their own general incompetence at everything or maybe a by product of most jobs allowing NO degree of control or decision making on employee&#8217;s parts DUE to general incompetence so by operational procedure the company tries to minimize the damage. I have a great idea - fire the incompetent people and demand more for a paycheck. Not more time - just more care and better decisions no matter how inconsequential. Gee that was totally stupid and incompetent - you are fired.</p>

<p>Here is the end result - People that actually work at companies not only cause the issues but they are no more capable of doing ANYTHING to fix them or figure them out than I am via whatever limited means I am provided on the customer service website. Since this is the case fire them all - really. Give me the same shitty ass service and shitty ass incompetence with out the overhead of employing these fucking morons and give me a lower cost that more closely matches the value without the annoyance of talking to people that you pay to do NOTHING more than I can do using your website.</p>

<p>The 6th F3 allegedly showed up this morning at 10:47 HERE at my place according to the tracking number. Hmmmm - wrong. It was delivered to the &#8220;side door&#8221;. Hmmm nope. Okay let&#8217;s call at noon. &#8220;Sir did you check with your neighbors?&#8221;. Ahhh no but I can see all of their doors from where I am standing and none of them live here in the winter - no packages. &#8220;Well you might want to check with them.&#8221; But&#8230;. cut off. Grrrrrr. I walk outside and go to every hose that is anywhere near mine - no packages anywhere. Assholes. Call back and this time I am pretty mad - you see now i am doing UPS&#8217;s job for them. The bottom line is that an investigation needs to be opened but I can&#8217;t do that as I didn&#8217;t ship the item. Hmmm, you can&#8217;t just hit the submit button after you check the checkbox that says &#8220;start investigation&#8221;? Nope. Better yet - you knew exactly where it was, what office, what truck - that&#8217;s what the little barcode things are for you shithead. Call that fucking incompetent ass of a driver that is still in the neighborhood on his cell screwing with facebook and tell him he fucked up and fix it NOW. No&#8230; the person that shipped the item must go to the UPS store where it was shipped from so that they UPS store can check the checkbox to hit submit a fucking week from now.</p>

<p>Oh I have to fuck around for an hour or two and then the other guy has to fuck around for an hour or two so that somebody sitting next to you can check the checkbox days from now to look into it? Fire them, give me a lower cost. They are useless.</p>

<p>Bullshit fuck you - fuck you.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. The contest is still on I still have 5 Nikon F3&#8217;s.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I posted a CrappyWorkPrint™ of my normal StupidCrap™ test subjects a while ago and went on to explain some of the virtues of using a pyro developer. It seems that there was at least a tiny bit of interest in what the heck I was talking about. Probably more curiosity than practicality. Anyway I received a couple questions about what is what on that post and decide to synthesize the answers in to a few clarifications and a post.</p>

<p>Even if you are not interested in ever using a pyro film developer there might be a few things to think about here regarding the use of film (negative - not slide film) as well as a general method of operating when deciding what to do with some of your work - even digital.</p>

<p>First off here is a CrappyScan™ of the CrappyWorkPrint™ of my StupidCrap™</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;Delta100-print&#8221; size=&#8221;large&#8221; id=&#8221;2837&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>I shot this when testing one of the 9 or 10 year out of date Ilford Delta 100 in a box I unearthed from a long ago move. I knew it would make pictures but needed to understand it&#8217;s particular characteristics acquired after my very carefully uncontrolled aging process. Here is what I did.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Set my meter to ISO 50 as it had probably lost some speed. Just need to gauge how much.</li>
    <li>Shot random images of StupidCrap™ that were all over the map in terms of contrast and brightness ranges.</li>
    <li>Happend to be semi-interested in this particular eagle flying among the clouds. So I shot a couple of frames after doing some ill-concieved calculations that lead to me metering the sky and adding two stops of overexposure (Zone VII for you B+W guys).</li>
    <li>Now that is all fine and dandy if I were to develop the film somewhere close to normal contrast here tis the &#8220;but&#8221; - I finished the roll quickly and decided that the only images I cared about were kinda low contrast - like that sky in the image. It was kinda gray and flat visually. Hence I made the decision to develop the living crap out of it - somewhere around N+2 contrast (think two to three stop push in over development). Yea but I exposed it a stop over in the first place. Usually if you develop for higher contrast you want to under expose the film by a bit - like a stop or a little more for N+2. The sky will now go through the roof in terms of density.</li>
    <li>Let&#8217;s see what happened.</li>
</ul>


<p>Well the negative is very very very thick and there was a bit of fog from the age of the film that was exacerbated by the overdevelopment.  But guess what - the Pyro held detail in the sky, the overdevelopment boosted the contrast to a level where I could see detail that I didn&#8217;t even see with my eyes when shooting the image. Mind you that Pyro is in no way a fine grained developer - it&#8217;s more like Rodinal, very very sharp. The over development, the overall overexposure, and the fog contributed even more in the grain department but I will tell you from experience with a lot of materials that the amount of detail that is rendered and retained in those blasted out highlights (the entire SKY) is pretty amazing. That is what people mean when they talk about increased highlight detail - black and white film + pyro is amazing at doing this. It does not mean anything about where you decide to print these values - if you jamb them all up in the white of the paper you cannot see them. I decided I wanted to render the sky in the upper midtones so I could see what was going on. Hence I printed it very dark.</p>

<p>This is just a strait print so I can see what is going on in the image - when I print or am working on a project I usually take some of my favorite images and print them. Typically &#8220;strait&#8221; without a whole lot of special treatment. If I am unsure of two massively different variations I print them both - still really simple prints. I then live with them a little bit, like a week and make decisions about how I really want to treat them in terms of paper type - size - local adjustments - etc. Then I will make those and live with them for a while, in many cases I decide that I do not want to go any farther and those prints get filed away. The true gems are the prints that I can live with and find interesting over the course of time. Those are the ones that make it to a final printing stage for me.</p>

<p>I do the same thing when working on personal projects even if the end result is a book. I find that living with your images on paper - somewhere that you spend a lot of time consistently makes for a better edit of what&#8217;s in, what&#8217;s out, and what to do with a particular image that trying to do that in one shot or one session on the computer. I am very often surprised by what makes it to my final images. It&#8217;s way different than what I would have guessed at the beginning of the  process. One of the big things I do is I do not cut personal project image on the basis of technical crap - the only criteria is if I like it or I don&#8217;t.</p>
