  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/DSC_0348.jpg"><img title="DSC_0348.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.DSC_0348.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_0348.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="101" align="left" /></a>Had a couple of readers write in about my last post on the Leica M9. Specifically my classification of the Leica being a &#8220;small&#8221; camera. A picture is worth a thousand words so I quickly assembled a typical Nikon DSLR kit and then the equivalent Leica M series kit to show you side by side. As you can see the Leica kit is way, way, way smaller and I will assure you the images are way, way, way better. No compromise.</p>

<p>This is for those of you who have never ever used/held/seen a Leica M series kit up close and personal. It is really small compared to the DSLR equivalent. This is a big deal. Remember I said NO COMPROMISE. The Leica has the same sized sensor - actually in this case the M9 would have a bigger sensor than DX or the same as an FX. The comparison that I am showing is actually in the DSLR&#8217;s favor, here&#8217;s why. The DSLR kit is a DX body, therefore I included a DX wide zoom, the 12-24 AFS f4. So this specific Nikon kit has an angle of view range of about 18mm to 105mm on an FX sized body. From 18mm to 35mm you get a constant aperture of f4. From ~40mm to 105mm you get an aperture of f2.8. If we were using an FX body like the D3 the size would go up, not the body but the wide zoom would probably be the 17-35 AFS f2.8, about the same size as the 28-70 AFS f2.8 shown here. That is giant and really heavy. Not only that but the range goes from 105mm down to 70mm at the long end.</p>

<p>On the Leica end this kit has a focal length range of 35mm to 90mm, an FX sized sensor and an aperture of f2. Want to go wider, fine just add a 21mm or an 18mm Leica anywhere from f3.8 all the way to f1.4 - and they are still tiny. Want to go faster - upgrade everything to f1.4 and the size doesn&#8217;t change that much. I caarry the Leica body and 4 lenses in a Domke F-9 or something. That bag is tiny, it might get away with the D series body with NO lens. I could fit another 2 lenses or one lens and another Leica body in the F9.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/2000_064_07.jpg"><img title="2000_064_07.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.2000_064_07.jpg" border="0" alt="2000_064_07.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="102" height="150" align="left" /></a>Remember my ill fated new camera scheme back at the beginning of the summer? If you don&#8217;t here it is in a nutshell. Sell my relatively new stuff while the resale value is still high and buy a D700 and a D3x. Well I sold my stuff and in the short time that I was without it I realized my old stuff, my really old stuff like my D2 series stuff was just fine. There was no way I was now going to drop $10,000, even if most of it was subsidized by my recent sale of newer bodies.</p>

<p>You may also remember that I have pooh poohed all of the small cameras that have hit the scene since the beginning of time. None have held a candle to my DSLR stuff in terms of quality so I don&#8217;t own one. They all still make crappy images unlike my small Leica M6. I guess I got spoiled 25 years ago when my small Leica &#8220;travel&#8221; kit produced fantastic images, maybe better than all of my big SLR junk. I guess my standards for small camera images have been set impossibly high. Heck even if small cameras produced adequate images, not great, but adequate, I was just not able to get over feeling so compromised. I ended up using my D200 and a smaller lens kit as my &#8220;small&#8221; camera.</p>

<p>Finally, finally, finally <a href="http://us.leica-camera.com/photography/m_system/m9/">Leica has released the M9 earlier this month</a>. The M9 is exactly what I have been craving. Finally my small camera is back and it&#8217;s digital. All of my Leica glass will work just fine on it with no magnifier effect, not so bad for DSLR&#8217;s but killer for a rangefinder, rendering the M8 series useless for the lens kit I owned. Finally no more feeling like I would love to bring my Leica M6 but I am doing that for convenience so I will have to deal with inconvenient Â film, ahhh screw it I will just take the D200. Finally.</p>

<p>I am getting an M9 with my proceeds from earlier this summer. That is final. I may wait a month or so but this is a done deal. I may even buy myself a lens for the M9 as well, not that I need any more lenses. Maybe I will get something outrageous like the <a href="http://en.leica-camera.com/photography/m_system/lenses/5915.html">new Noctilux</a>, like I don&#8217;t have enough fast Lieca 50&#8217;s. Hey this is RB-o-nomics at work. I was set on spending 10,000, I ended up not spending it, so now anything that is 10,000 or under is free - you see that money was already psychologically gone anyway. Hmmmmm, M9+Noctilux, same $10,000 bucks but I will get a forever lens that will probably double in value over the next 10 years since nobody in their right mind buys them except crazy people and when they stop making them the 14 made will cost like $1mm. This plus I will have so much fun using this thing for like the first 6 months vs the $10,000 in same old same old Nikon bodies that are great cameras but will be worth spit in 2 years. The M9 will still be worth spit also but Leica spit at least and that would only be half of the $10,000 investment or so.</p>

<p>I just had to post an image that I shot with my Leica M6. This was shot with my 90mm Elmarit at 2.8, wide open, 1/125 on Kodak TRI-X pushed to 1600 processed in believe it or not PMK pyro. Obviously not the first time I tried that combo. Ooooooh I cannot wait. This is the first time that I have had gear lust in like ummmm, 5 years.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, my faith is shaken. I have seen way to muck crap lately. Business crap, crap photography, and crap that defies categorization. I was just looking at some fantastic photography that does not suck. Again I am being inspired by a photojournalist but this time with a twist. This guy was covering of all things fashion. Marcus Bleasdale&#8217;s journalistic images covering the 2009 fashion show scene in europe are downright moving. <a href="http://www.viiphoto.com/showstory.php?nID=1001">Check this out at VII</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am in an extremely bad and funky mood today, so if you are not in the mood to commiserate on planetary and possibly intergalactic suck-y-ness then you may want to move on. So why do things suck? We&#8217;ll after thinking about it for like 30 seconds, things suck because people are idiots combined with the recent evolution of just about everything being too cheap and too easy. I am not talking about a specific person, I am generally pretty tolerant in one on one cases, I am speaking about populations - just about any population, be it &#8220;photographers&#8221;, &#8220;software developers&#8221;, Â movie directors, whites, blacks, asians, republicans, democrats, etc.</p>

<p>Case in point - photography. We have loads of it but in my opinion the images have gotten worse not better. Maybe the color is better, maybe the focus is better, and god knows in focus or not they are all idiotically &#8220;sharper&#8221; and more saturated. The problem is what used to be fantastic indicators of crappy photographs are gone so for most idiots it is hard to tell the difference between a good photograph and a not so good photograph. Hence just like 50 years ago most photographs are crap, they suck, only now they look like good photographs at first glance. For instance take 499 crappy images and put them on a web page with 1 fantastic image. Can you find it? I doubt it, unless you are willing to wade through the muck. So which one do you look at? For 99.9999999% of humans you look at the brightest, most contrasty, most blaring, screaming, eye-blistering one there is. That is why photography sucks. I liked it better when it took time, effort, and cost money to make something eye blistering. Now that eye blistering is free, quick, and easy I move that all camera makers, image software producers, etc. just make eye blistering the default mode and we can be done with it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey why are you making that okay picture of your new born making my eye&#8217;s bleed with the dave hill auto filter?&#8221;</p>

<p>answer: &#8220;cause if I don&#8217;t everybody with think it is not fantastic.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8221;but it&#8217;s not fantastic, and now it&#8217;s horrific&#8221;</p>

<p>answer: &#8220;now it is&#8221;</p>

<p>This extends to just about everything, take software as another instance. Wordpress is the biggest pile of steaming crap ever. I swear to god I am ditching this thing as soon as I have a week to write my own content management software. Why does it suck? not the technology, not the PHP, it sucks because there is so much utter shit written by shit-heads pretending to be software developers that is now Wordpress it is unbelievable. That goes for all of PHP-dom. I wouldn&#8217;t get involved in the PHP community if my life depended on it, - 99.9% grocery store clerks churning out utter crap that includes all of the other convenience Â store checkout peoples shitty code. - 0.1% actual software development people. Hell these people are so stupid it is impossible to even communicate why their code is shitty to them.</p>

<p>Maybe barriers to entry into any endeavor are not such a bad idea, not gigantic ones, just little tiny ones. The problem is it is too cheap and easy to make anything look acceptable. It should be just a tiny bit harder. Just a tiny bit. LIke it cost you 5 cents every time you hit the eye-bliter button. Something like that. Problem is just turning something on - no matter what - will get you acceptable sound, appearance, etc. There is no way for whatever anybody is trying to do to NOT to WORK and look/sound/etc okay. Hence we get things that suck from idiots. &#8220;News&#8221;, &#8220;entertainment&#8221;, &#8220;images&#8221;, &#8220;music&#8221; tons of it because there are no barriers to entry in any endeavor and by default you get stuff that looks, sounds, smells, just like everyone else&#8217;s. Just make it loud and cheap and your not only there - you win.</p>

<p>That is why stuff sucks.</p>

<p>Rant over.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/DSC0029.jpg"><img title="DSC0029.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.DSC0029.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC0029.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="99" height="150" align="left" /></a>Been really really busy lately so I haven&#8217;t had time to complain about Apple and their apparent conspiracy to drive Aperture users completely out of their minds so I thought I would rant a little and maybe even provide a little helpful info for the uninitiated photo manipulator (retoucher/whatever). Yep another Apple announcement and not peep about Aperture. I didn&#8217;t really expect one at the music event but it just is another tiny little mile-marker of no Aperture updates. Hey if Apple can put a freaking movie camera in a freaking nano why the heck can&#8217;t I have a god dang Aperture update?</p>

<p>Anyway on to the rant/education session. A reader emailed me and asked me why every time I mention Aperture updates I rail about the lack of non-destructive local adjustments and pooh-pooh the lame dodge/burn tool. The reader thought that it worked &#8220;fine&#8221;. Okay here is a short answer. Local dodge/burn is absolutely fundamental in just about every photographic endeavor you can pursue. It is pretty much up there with lighting, color, composition, etc. The fact is that it may be the only fundamental part in the image making process that Aperture lacks, at least non-distructively. The non-destructive part is really not about destruction, it&#8217;s about fine tuning and trying different amounts, etc. To have such a lame tool for such a fundamental thing just plain sucks.</p>

<p>You might be saying &#8220;What?, dodge and burn fundamental?&#8221; Yup - assume you have the light, composition, subject, etc right. All done right? Nope - even if you have no taste for anything way out there in terms of image manipulation - just strait photography, old schoool. For that matter new school. Local exposure adjustments pretty much make or break just about every photograph that you have ever admired, liked, or even grabbed your attention for more than an instant. Ever hear the idiotic and overly used new fangled term &#8220;painting with light&#8221;. That is new internet speak for dodging and burning. You want your images to look &#8220;as good as that guy&#8217;s (substitute your favorite photographer of the moment) There is a 100% chance that local exposure adjustments will get you 80% of the way there.</p>

<p>Here is a relatively stark example of what I am talking about. When you see the two images side by side there will be absolutely no confusion as to which one was &#8220;manipulated&#8221;. I am not claiming that this is a masterful example I did it in about 90 seconds right before I wrote this and I was a bit heavy handed to the point of bordering on cartoonishness for the purposes of illustration. Dollars to doughnuts that 99.9% of people would have no idea that I messed with it if I did not show the before and make it so obvious.</p>

<p>Here is the original using ACR RAW processing defaults strait out of the camera. The color sucks because I used ACR default, the Nikon camera profiles are spot on and look fantastic right out of the camera.</p>

<p><img title="DSC0029_1.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/DSC0029_1.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC0029_1.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="464" height="700" /></p>

<p>Not too, too bad. Fantastic model, generally good colors, nice lighting, separation from the background, in focus, reasonably sharp. Okay now what. Well let&#8217;s get the color back to the way Nikon intended using one of the ACR Nikon camera profiles, I used D2x mode 3 - I really really liked the D2 series mode there color renditions. Kind of made me nostalgic for the good old days where film actually had a color personality. Oh one more thing, lets dodge and burn it a little.</p>

<p><img title="DSC0029.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/DSC0029.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC0029.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="464" height="700" /></p>

<p>Hey now we are cooking with gas. That&#8217;s right folks, just your garden variety dodge and burn, or as the kids say &#8220;painting with light&#8221;. In case you can&#8217;t see it I will walk you though the changes. I darkened the edges a hair, burned down the hotspot on the headboard, and burned down the sheets in the lower right. Even with a grid and the box feathered in I just could not keep the light off the bottom right of the sheets. I guess I could have put a gobo up but I was minus an assistant. That&#8217;s it for the burning. You may be surprised but I actually dodged the highlights in general to emphasize highlights that were there, I just make them more obvious and a wee bit more specular to add a bit more curviness to the models curviness and add some shininess to her hair. Emphasizing highlights like this to add a little extra dimension is the bread and butter of pretty much all photographic retouching be it fashion, beauty, or landscapes.</p>

<p>For the couple of people that asked here is the image with ACR using the D2x mode three camera profile without the local adjustments to make it easier to see where exactly what is going on in the image.</p>

<p><img title="DSC0029_2.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/DSC0029_2.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC0029_2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="464" height="700" /></p>

<p>Any more questions why I think Apple needs to ditch the bad example of a dodge and burn plug-in?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I hate hackers - they are stupid (mostly) and generally not real productive at actually accomplishing anything except breaking things and causing unnecessary extra work for those that actually contribute to society.</p>

<p>Anyway I am sorry to all of the people that could not get to my site this morning. A wave of Wordpress attacks hit not only me but a ton of Wordpress sites all over the place - just googleÂ /%&amp;({${eval(base64_decode($_SERVER[HTTP_EXECCODE]))}}|.+)&amp;%/ if you want to see a bunch of them yourself (yep google already indexed them)</p>

<p>Anyway the attack appears to be coming from IP address 122.135.85.220. I just finished firing up a new virtual server with pristine code/data for all of you out there and am just starting to run this down. If anyone wants to help you have the source IP and this looks like the exploit used but I am still researching the entire sequence of events from my logs. It maybe that this is all there is to it but I want to be thorough.</p>

<p>Here is what I believe to be the hack:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I received my copy of Snow Leopard on Monday directly from Apple. Being the instant gratification kind of guy I am I immediately fired up the upgrade on my oldest intel machine in my possession. A first generation intel Macbook Pro, a machine that I keep up to date with software that I use but definitely non-critical and rarely used.</p>

<p>The upgrade went so well, so fast, and actually seemed snappier on this non-64 bit intel that I forged ahead and upgraded all of my intel machines to Snow Leopard the same day. Not real smart but hey, I had a good idea that my critical applications would have no major issues. I will not go into the boring details of Snow Leopard as there are plenty of places that you can read those, I will give you a run down of my first three days focusing on the issues that I have run into common to all of my machines.</p>

<p>First of the experience has been overwhelmingly pain-free. So far so good. The upgrades have all gone really fast with no hitches. Aperture runs fine and I have not had any really hairy incompatibilities. I have been trying to avoid rosetta so the fact that Snow Leopard only installs it if you ask it to has been eye opening in that there was actually more Power-PC software floating around than I had thought I had. None of it in use, mostly just Power-PC crap that has accumulated over the years that auto starts and has been carried around to new machines via setup assistant. The good news is that it is all gone now. I am Power-PC free.</p>

<p>Problem number one - LogMeIn.com clients in 64bit Safari do not work exactly right. I you try to access a remote machine using 64bit Safari you will get an error telling you to restart your browser. For a perfectionist like me this is intolerable, for normal people this is no big deal - just fire up Safari in 32bit or alternatively the error really isn&#8217;t a giant issue there is a workaround that pretty much lets you bypass the error by going directly to the remote url vs clicking on the remote machine that works as well. If anyone would like the specifics on this one just ask.</p>

<p>Problem/Annoyance number two - Again this one is not a deal breaker but for someone like me it is an intolerable annoyance and things like this are why I am an Apple guy and do no touch Windoze. Blue tooth headset behavior has changed, grrrrrrrrr. The way it used to work is most apps like Skype allowed you to select a particular audio device for use within that app but without changing the global defaults for audio in and out. This is good and when a blue tooth audio device was detected under regular old leopard a message would pop up asking you if you wanted to 1) disconnect it, 2) connect it but ignore it, and 3) use it (as the default). Cool. What my normal process was was to connect it but do not &#8220;use&#8221; it. This allows apps specifically that specify it to use it but iTunes, YouTube, et al still used the system default. NOW under Snow Leopard you get two choices when a bluetooth audio device is detected - 1)disconnect it and 2) use it (as the default). THIS SUCKS, now every time I turn on my bluetooth headset I MUST CHOOSE use it, which in turn sets the system default in and out to the headset, then go into system preferences and set the defaults back to what I want them to be so that I can use the headset with skype and my other VOIP stuff while not affecting the reset of my systems. THIS MUST GET FIXED. grrrrrrr.</p>

<p>Anyway - that is it in terms of my issues so far. Very very nice. Oh and there is one more thing - not to most people and not really an issue, just something I did not anticipate. I am also a Ruby software developer and use the crap out of my machines for Ruby/Rails/etc. EVERYTHING in Snow Leopard is 64bit by default sooooo when you fire up the new version (build) of Ruby in the default execution path you get a 64bit Ruby interpreter - by default under leopard any Gems that you installed that have native modules that were compiled as 32bit execs. These will not load in the 64bit Ruby interpreter process space. Solution - either fire up Ruby in 32bit or what I did, re-install all of you gems that have native extetensions, this worked like a charm for all the gems I used, in typical Apple fashion the newly compiled native gem extensions are universal 32bit/64bit by default as long as you have installed the new Xcode goodies.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t have your copy yet - get <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000410511&amp;tag=rbde-20">Snow Leopard Here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&#8217;t know about you but I am scratching my head over some of the latest announcements from Nikon, Leica, and Olympus. The least puzzling are the Nikon products, they are the least puzzling but also nothing to write home about. Not only are they nothing to write home about but they are also not going to get me to part with my hard earned cash.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s review Nikon&#8217;s new stuff real quick. First we have the D300s whooopie we now have HD video and another card slot of a different type of media. Fantastic. A really small D3000 that maybe the most interesting thing but not for me. Last we get a mildly updated 70-200 AFS 2.8 VR. Don&#8217;t get me wrong if you happen to be in the market for these and don&#8217;t already have something similar they are great and make Nikon&#8217;s offerings in all of these categories a little fresher. What I personally would have love to have seen is a massive price drop on the D300 exactly like it is, a D700x at the current D700 price point and the D700 exactly like it is with a price drop to where the D300 currently sits. I am no costing expert but I have to believe that the D700 as it sits today cannot possibly cost more to produce than the D300 did when it was brand new. Given the current state of affairs with the economy and everyone selling less product than they did a year or two ago I would think that kind of announcement would jolt a lot of people sitting around with older bodies into an upgrade frenzy, spur a couple of fence sitting photographers using other brands to switch, and people looking to move up the Nikon line to go nuts. Just saying&#8230;</p>

<p>Moving on to the Leica S2. What a fantastic system, the only catch is that If I was in the market for something like this I would have committed to one of the MF systems that have been around for a number of YEARS. If I was using say a Hasselblad H2D or H3D with any number of digital backs what the heck would I want this thing for? I just don&#8217;t get who this camera is targeted at. If you have ideas let me know.</p>

<p>Last is the Olympus - you know the one that cost a bundle but is really not much more than a point and shoot with no view finder. Give me the Canon G9 or G10 any day. Who the heck is this thing for?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/DSC_0315_Viveza.jpg"><img title="DSC_0315_Viveza.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/.thumbs/.DSC_0315_Viveza.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_0315_Viveza.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="100" align="left" /></a>I still use Adobe Photoshop, in fact I just upgraded to CS4 a little while ago but what I use it for is becoming more and more specialized and far less frequent. Maybe I will do a rundown on exactly what I use it for some other day. The reason that I use it far less than I used to is due to Nik Software, specifically Nik Viveza.</p>

<p>I was first introduced to Nik Software&#8217;s unique way of doing things in Nikon NX and NX2. NX and NX2 come with color control points built-in, Viveza is a plug-in for Aperture and Adobe products that pretty much boils down to color control points. NX2 goes beyond that in allowing you to use control points as masks for anything else NX2 can do as well but I will stick to color control pointsÂ as this is what Viveza does. I used to use Photoshop for local adjustments and I still do but 90% of what I do for my personal work can be done with Viveza. In fact it is so easy and intuitive that I rather use Viveza than other methods of making selections and masks if I can.</p>

<p>The Nik Software website has a far better tutorial on what control points are and how they work than I would care to put together. Instead of a walk through I will be brief and just show a practical example of one of the ways that I use Viveza as well as my opinion on the variations of packaging from Nik and my opinions on what you should buy. One word of caution that cannot be repeated enough, do not interpret this example as how Viveza can rescue a really bad photograph and make a good one. This example is how Viveza can help you get what you want from a scene quickly and easily if you know where you want to go.</p>

<p>The image at the top of the post is a pretty much final version of an image that I have had a number of discussions with on-line iBuddiesâ„¢ regarding &#8220;how I did it&#8221;. I produced it as a black and white using Nik Silver EFEX and the people were very interested in the post processing so I figured I would do a color version with Viveza for your pleasure (or not). Here is the original image strait out of camera using Aperture&#8217;s default RAW conversion.</p>

<p><img title="DSC_0315original.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/DSC_0315original.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_0315original.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="700" height="469" /></p>

<p>Bleahhhk, but not an accident. I shot it this way because I know exactly what my camera does and planned to produce a black and white version using Silver EFEX. This image&#8217;s entire reason to exist from my point of view was the sky and the reflections in the water. I wanted it to have a feeling that it was late in the day (it was 6/24/09 at 8pm right around the summer solstice). The only thing that I wanted to make sure of was that I could ratchet the hell out of the contrast while while retaining detail in the brightest clouds, reflections in the water, and detail in the ripples on the water without going totally white or totally black. For my taste most images with really strong clouds that have the contrast ratcheted up end up blowing out the whites in the bright areas of the clouds. The problem with that is the clouds look like they are made out of cement and loose the gaseous vapor feeling in those images, especially on paper.</p>

<p>Moving on, this is the version I sent into Viveza.</p>

<p><img title="DSC_0315adjusted.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/DSC_0315adjusted.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_0315adjusted.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="700" height="468" /></p>

<p>Wow, that&#8217;s a whole lot better, nice. For those interested this took about 10 seconds in Aperture in the following order:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Boosted the contrast to get the overall separation I was looking for.</li>
    <li>Bumped up the brightness a tad until the whitest part of the clouds still had the detail I wanted.</li>
    <li>Now that I could see where all the colors were hiding I cooled the white balance a hair to get the sky and blue water reflections where I wanted them while retaining the golden sun on the sunlit sides clouds, boats, and water.</li>
    <li>Bumped up the definition a hair to make the tiny little boats and ripples stand out a little more.</li>
    <li>Bumped up the vibrance a bit until the sky had the exact tone that I wanted without blowing the blue channel and it going all primary color on me.</li>
    <li>Bumped up the shadows a hair, mainly to give them some breathing room for the torture I was about to subject them to in Vivza. I find that the shadow slider in Aperture in combination with the &#8220;advanced&#8221; controls does a way better job in boosting the shadows into a usable range while maintaining good color than just about any other tool i have used. Bottom line - you could use Viveza to make the shadows a little bit brighter but it does not do as good a job so do it before you send it out of Aperture.</li>
</ol>


<p>And here is the version with local adjustments done in Viveza in about a minute with a couple of control points.</p>

<p><img title="DSC_0315_Viveza.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/DSC_0315_Viveza.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_0315_Viveza.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="700" height="468" /></p>

<p>Here is a conceptual description of what I did. If you give <a style="&quot;border:none" href="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26store-name%3Dsoftware%26redirect%3Dtrue%26search-type%3Dss%26index%3Dsoftware%26ref%3Dbl%255Fsr%255Fsoftware%26field-brandtextbin%3DNik%2520Software&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&quot;&gt;Name Your Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=">Viveza</a> a trial spin you will know why a conceptual description is good enough. If any of you think it would be helpful I could be convinced to post a screen-cast of the actual Viveza session from start to finish.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Control point(s) in the water on the brightest reflection to boost the brightness and contrast.</li>
    <li>Control points in the grey/neutral clouds on on the horizon set to do nothing in order to subtract the water selection from the sky.</li>
    <li>Control point on the clouds at the right to boost contrast a hair.</li>
    <li>Control point(s) on the bluest of blue sky to bring down the brightness a hair.</li>
</ol>


<p>The bottom line is Vivza and control points are actually fun to use, they encourage you to try things and variations on things that you may not do if you had to go through laborious convolutions to mask them. The fact is after you use control points in Viveza, NX2, or the other Nik Software products, just about any other way of making selections seems laborious.</p>

<p>Nik sells Viveza in a couple of different ways in a couple of different bundles that seem to change fairly often over the life of the product. The key differentiator is one works with Photoshop and the other will ONLY work in Aperture. If you do not own Photoshop and never ever want to use Photoshop get the version or bundle that will only work with Aperture. If you own Photoshop get the one that works with Photoshop, even if you never or rarely use it. In fact personally images from Aperture to Photoshop just to use Viveza even though I can do it either way. You may ask why - the answer is that I make the image in PS a smart object and then render the Viveza plugin on the smart object. I do this because all of the control points are saved and can be re-tweaked later without reproducing the whole shooting match from scratch. This seems trivial to do an I wonder why the Aperture plug-in mechanism does not work this way. I sure hope that it does in the future.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. Let me know if a screen-cast of the session would be helpful. Oh one more thing, if you do end up getting <a style="&quot;border:none" href="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26store-name%3Dsoftware%26redirect%3Dtrue%26search-type%3Dss%26index%3Dsoftware%26ref%3Dbl%255Fsr%255Fsoftware%26field-brandtextbin%3DNik%2520Software&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&quot;&gt;Name Your Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=">Viveza</a> I would really appreciate it if you got it <a style="&quot;border:none" href="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26store-name%3Dsoftware%26redirect%3Dtrue%26search-type%3Dss%26index%3Dsoftware%26ref%3Dbl%255Fsr%255Fsoftware%26field-brandtextbin%3DNik%2520Software&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&quot;&gt;Name Your Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=">here</a> to help offset the cost of keeping the site going.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/DSC_0300___Version_2__1_.jpg"><img title="DSC_0300___Version_2__1_.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/.thumbs/.DSC_0300___Version_2__1_.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_0300___Version_2__1_.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="101" align="left" /></a>Just wanted to share a couple of random tidbits from the week of stuff that I learned or relearned or haven&#8217;t thought about for a while that some of you may find useful. Like most of you I figure things out by intent or accident about 700 times a day and always say &#8220;I should write that down&#8221; - I never do but I say it anyway. This week I decided that at least I would pass along a couple Apple/Photo/Aperture related things that a couple of you may enjoy. Your milage could vary.</p>

<p>I had to make a quick print of the attached image and did not feel like changing ink sets for my &#8220;pro&#8221; printer so I made one on one of my trusty free printers from Apple, specifically the Canon PIXMA iP4200 that I usually use for invoices and such. Anyway to make a long story short I remembered that when I tested it a couple of years ago with the free Canon photo paper that was included I was actually impressed with the color accuracy and overall quality given that I was using direct printing from Aperture (no RIP) and the indecipherable profiles that Canon provides were unbelievably accurate and actually did expand the gamut of the printer to more closely resemble AdobeRGB. Soooo I had only 4x6 Canon paper left but a gaggle of HP advanced photo glossy that I got for free somewhere in 8.5x11. I figured I would give it a try considering I am lazy and was not about to profile the printer paper combination.</p>

<p>Guess what! Using the Canon SP2 (Canon Photo Plus Paper) profile with the HP advanced glossy looked fantastic. Out of curiosity I printed the same image on the Canon 4x6 paper and they looked identical. Bottom line - if you have a Canon the SP2 ICC profile is a perfect match when using HP advanced glossy if you are in a pinch.</p>

<p>Moving on here is a big surprise that I also stumbled upon by complete accident. I was using my iPhone headphones with my new Unibody MacBook Pro and guess what I discovered. The little microphone works when plugged into the MacBookPro headphone jack. This is fantastic considering I am a big-time Skype user and can now eliminate one more thing that I carry when I travel, namely my USB microphone. I hate the sound quality using the built in mic on the MacBook, you just cannot get close enough and it picks up too much ambient. I have no idea when this started to work hardware wise but if you have a unibody or something around that vintage try it. You gotta love apple for including things like this. Is it documented anywhere? I&#8217;ve never seen it anywhere from Apple.</p>

<p>Last but not least for those that use Aperture. I re-re-re learned the best way to solve random wackiness in behavior when printing directly from Aperture, like what I experienced with borderless printing not working for my quick and dirty print, is to trash the printing preferences and presets in the ~Library/ApplicationSupport/Aperture directory. I forgot this because I have been using the ColorByte RIP for a long time now to deal with my printing needs.</p>
