  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, I guess we might still see it soon. Maybe? Not today. I will keep plugging away at my old Aperture. I will have to buy one of the tablets just to console myself. Maybe it will out by the time the tablets are actually available. Who knows but this is getting ridiculous. Well, it&#8217;s really not so bad - it could be way worse, like if I had to use Lightroom or something. That is still a fate that I do not want to befall us all.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t take me wrong - Lightroom is better than nothing but certainly nothing to be excited about after Aperture. As I have said before it is not much different in productivity and image management than using Bridge/ACR/PS. I just want Apple to spread some 64bit goodness on my favorite photo management program. Is that too much to ask? Really?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Based on super secret research of my own and jumping to a lot of conclusions I really really think Aperture 3 is here - or will be maybe tomorrow. Here is the scoop. As many of you know I am about the only Aperture guy that actually participates in the Apple forums in any regular or frequent way. The other guys are mercenary and will not help anyone if they are not getting paid. Forget that for a moment, I don&#8217;t want to rant too much.</p>

<p>Anyway - over the last few days the Apple Aperture forum and other Aperture related pages have been down far more frequently than usual. Here is the kicker - for more than a day the Aperture 2 tutorials have Â been unavailable as well. Is this all in preparation for the new stuff, the new Aperture. Aperture 3, Aperture X, whatever. The holy grail of all things photo software?</p>

<p>I actually am more excited by this than any of the other little indicators that I have seen in many months. This is typical of a new product. Is it just coincidence? A trick?</p>

<p>I hope not.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>UPDATE.</p>

<p>Breaking news&#8230; or Breaking French Bullshit. See if you can decipher what the hell these Aperture guys are talking about - as near as I can tell the guy that posted it is claiming some sort of &#8220;inside info&#8221;. See what you can get out of it:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/albumpick.jpg"><img title="albumpick.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/.thumbs/.albumpick.jpg" border="0" alt="albumpick.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="92" align="left" /></a>While we are anxiously waiting to see if Aperture 3 will pop out somewhere in the midst of all the iTablet hoopla this week, I thought I would offer a small tip for your current Aperture workflow. This is one that is obvious once you hear it but can be extremely frustrating if you &#8220;expect&#8221; Aperture to work differently than it actually does.</p>

<p>As long time users know one of the secrets to using Aperture effectively is taking full advantage of the way Aperture stacks, albums, and album picks work. As usual I promote the extremely liberal use of albums and new versions for just about everything imaginable. I was coaching a fellow Aperture user on a particular nuance that was frustrating him and thought his issue might be frustrating more than a few people.</p>

<p>Typically if you make a new version in the context of an album it automatically becomes the album pick. This is fantastic as I have described numerous times in many of the workflow related tips on this site and in the Aperture organization eBook. Here is the rub - a lot of external editors and plug-in&#8217;s do not behave the same way. In many cases when you create a new version via &#8220;edit with&#8230;&#8221; the new version using the external program is NOT made the album pick. Adding to the frustration is that you cannot select a bunch of versions and make them all the album pick at the same time - this doesn&#8217;t work. There is no way to promote a selection of images to album picks or stack picks. Only the primary selection is affected. Now what - tedious one by one promotion to album pick for your plug-in adjusted images? No way, that is way way to slow - we may as well use Lightroom&#8217;s feeble organizational tools and mouse heavy UI.</p>

<p>Here is the answer. After creating new plug-in edited versions with reckless abandon in say Nik SilverEFX select all of the adjusted new versions. Make this easy on yourself and just use the search box to search for file types of TIF or something like that (version names if you need to). Then use Command-A to select them all. How every you do it when all the appropriate versions are selected - hit Command - L or use the context menu to create a new album from selection. Done! That&#8217;s it - all of the versions selected will be the album picks in the new album.</p>

<p>Hope this helps shave a little time off your work-flow. (Us Aperture users are a demanding lot aren&#8217;t we)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/2010_001_10.jpg"><img title="2010_001_10.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/.thumbs/.2010_001_10.jpg" border="0" alt="2010_001_10.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="120" align="left" /></a>A reader that stumbled across my site specifically looking for black and white prints was interested one of my Adox MCC 110 Â sample prints but wanted something shot with a super fine grain film. Honestly with my eyes you cannot see the grain in an 8x10 of any of the medium format negatives that I offer as a selection but at the end of the day we settled on the image that you see with the post.</p>

<p>Yep it is a tree. Specifically it is a giant tree that I shot on medium format Kodak TMAX 100 film. That is about as fine grained high resolution as you can get. The sample print negotiation aside - I wanted to share a little about projects that I am working on this winter. The first one I decided on was the tree project. I have a big problem with projects and with the winter season in the mid-atlantic. My project problem is that they are usually over ambitious. At least my personal projects are - commercial projects are easy. My winter problem is even more serious - I hate the winter, I hate everything about it. Ever hear of seasonal depression - my case as long as I remember is more like seasonal disaster. I don&#8217;t like going outside. I think the world is an ugly place. I find nothing that is positive at all about the winter. I wish I could actually hibernate.</p>

<p>This year I took a little different strategy for getting me through - at least photographically. I decided I would shoot an outdoor project. The subject is trees. They are about the only thing that I find remotely interesting in the winter time. Some of them are more interesting than when they have leaves. They are also extremely challenging to me as a subject - at least they way that I want to shoot them. They must be shot in context and the context has a couple variations but they are all similar - dark subject on light background if they are big trees. Yea I know there are exceptions but that context is completely opposite of the way my photographic and aesthetic brain works in terms of negative space. Filters can make the situation worse in a lot of circumstances - bring the tree up and the sky down so they are the same - very flat.</p>

<p>In any case I have only seen one photographer that has done trees as a subject that I ever really loved. Yes it is a matter of taste - I have the guy&#8217;s name written down. I will try to find it. My tree project is simple - I want to make 10 images that I like - not that are my vision of perfect. That would take 10 life times like some of my other overly ambitious personal projects. Just 10 images that I like and speak simultaneously to my feelings on the winter season while somehow portraying the one shining example of beauty that I see. The project has a hard stop - the spring of this year.</p>

<p>Wish me luck I have only made 2 images that I like so far and winter is not that long - see how this project helps me get through the winter, this is one of them. I can feel the project deadline approaching fast now and I am only 20% done.</p>

<p>Hope this helps any other people that suffer through the season as I do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/DSC_7994.jpg"><img title="DSC_7994.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.DSC_7994.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_7994.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="99" align="left" /></a>Without getting way too philosophical on photographic lies and truth as this discussion is best had with really close friends while drinking - I want to offer up some thoughts on fake film borders or rebate. When I see these on a photograph that is clearly digital - the wrong aspect ration for the film - and edge lettering that is clearly done in photoshop it is an instant turn off for me. It&#8217;s probably even worse when it is &#8220;well done&#8221;.</p>

<p>I guess it is a turn off and bothers me because of it&#8217;s total lack of meaning in the digital world. It&#8217;s trying to do something - there is some sort of motivation to do this. I just don&#8217;t understand what that is. When photographers started this with real film it was not artifice - it was artistic statement. In the digital world it is hopeless artifice at best and a crude and deliberate un-truth at worst.</p>

<p>I love contact sheets and contact prints as art objects in and of themselves - they do have a meaning and looking over my own contact sheets from the dusty past is always a revelation. Especially in the context of final prints that I choose to make from that contact sheet. What I enjoy even more is looking at other photographers contact sheets - it is even more of a revelation and informs me more about an individuals art in some cases than the final work produced. I have wrestled with and attempted to reproduce this effect in the past for a more general audience but failed and that was with real film and real film edges and actual frame numbers - all of them. I have some ideas why the effect was different than an actual contact sheet - maybe I will try again someday.</p>

<p>In the digital world trying to produce this effect is, in my opinion crass. I am not saying that it is not worthwhile - I would love to collaborated with someone that knows what I am talking about to find a better way. What I am saying is that trying to produce the effect of containment by using artifacts that are not native to the process are absolute lies and the very concept of using those alien artifacts is wrong headed in the first place.</p>

<p>What is very curious is I have never stumbled upon anyone using these fake film edges that was also offering a camera produced RAW file as a final output. Wouldn&#8217;t this be the intent of such decoration - to offer the same implications of film rebate? Then why not make the RAW file available? Isn&#8217;t that the closest digital equivalent?</p>

<p>If I am totally out in left field on this I invite anyone to explain fake film edges to me from a journalistic standpoint - an artistic standpoint - and from a standpoint of integrity of the artist and the medium.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/salgado_covers.jpg"><img title="salgado_covers.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/.thumbs/.salgado_covers.jpg" border="0" alt="salgado_covers.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="98" align="left" /></a>Salgado is the journalistic photographer that to me symbolizes the art of journalistic photography. His images are everything a photograph can be. It isn&#8217;t just one aspect of the image - it is everything. The concept, the story, the content, the light, the framing, the moment, the people. When I grow up I want to make images like Salgado. Journalistic images, like a photojournalist but I also want them to be fantastically beautiful art. I want them to be good journalism and I want them to be good art.</p>

<p>If you make photographs and this guys images do not speak to you and say - &#8220;you suck&#8221; get better. Here is your wake up call. Oh they speak to everyone in other ways as well but deep down you know you suck when you see this guy&#8217;s stuff. You may be okay - you may even be acceptable at wrapping your mediocre images in artifice to distract people but&#8230; As a photographer you suck. If you don&#8217;t think you need to get better go see a Salgado exhibit.</p>

<p>Your first reaction will be to forget you are a photographer and these are photographs - you will be transported to another plane where none of that stuff matters. After you leave you will be inspired to get better. A lot better. If you think you are good at making images now - go to an exhibit.</p>

<p>Sort of reminds me of a story about Eric Clapton - He cried and swore to give up guitar playing after hearing Hendrix for the first time. He got it together and got better.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. If you think you need a better camera this should be your answer. If you think the biggest issue in your images is that god damn noise when you shoot at 6400 - again this is your answer to how important all that bullshit is.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Our good friend Michael just sent me a note that PDN is offering a reward for any pictures of Aperture 3. They are offering one dollar. It is sort of a spoof on another site&#8217;s giant reward for a picture of an iTablet but I am a little annoyed that they go on to say that no one is really clamoring for an Aperture 3 release.</p>

<p>They are sort of right if you take the entire Apple gadget market place into account but this is PDN - a site read by PHOTOGRAPHERS. Are they kidding? No one is waiting for Aperture 3? Then they offer a dollar for a reward - soft of like a who give&#8217;s a shit. Are these guys on the Adobe payroll? Here is the issue - the couple of comments on the article are all about the iTablet and really nobody has chimed in and let PDN know how stinking much us Aperture guys really want an Aperture 3.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pdnpulse.com/2010/01/pdnpulse-bounty-send-us-images-of-apple-aperture-3.html">Here is the Article</a> - you may want to let your voice be heard over there at PDN and let them know there is quite a loyal fan base for Aperture and they want Aperture 3 right freaking now. I know it&#8217;s not that big of a deal but come-on PDN.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know I rant about this all the time but today after surfing a couple of different photographer&#8217;s web sites I just have to let the steam vent a little (again). First off let me say - every site I visited the photographer&#8217;s work was fantastic. I expected it to be. I have seen it before. The issue is the site itself. It is not that it is ugly, it&#8217;s not. The issue is that somehow photographer&#8217;s seem to be disconnected from the rest of the internet universe in terms of what is annoying when using the web.</p>

<p>I include myself in that group - just listen to the complaints in the comments about the light text on the black background. I may reverse it just so it doesn&#8217;t get in the way of the content when I get a chance. Given the hideously disorganized mess of redundant CSS that I &#8220;borrowed&#8221; and hacked at, this will be a real task. Moving on to a crime that I am not guilty of that every other photo guy out there is - F&#8217;ing Flash. It&#8217;s not just flash, it&#8217;s the idiotic pain in the ass perpetrated by the flash guy who does these &#8220;photographer&#8221; web sites. Every freaking photographer seems to use the same guy or guys from the same school of thought.</p>

<p>The characteristics they all share that are so annoying I can&#8217;t even put the annoyance into words are as follows:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Somehow no matter how functionally deficient, the flash uses so much CPU that even having the site sit up there on your screen gets the fans whirling and at least one 3 Ghz CPU completely pegged. Amazing.</li>
    <li>They have an intro screen that takes a 30&#8221; monitor to see it all. On top of that there is usually NOTHING on that page except an &#8220;enter&#8221; button or something like that that is not clear that you have to mouse over to even figure out what to do next. That ONE thing that gets you into the next flash disaster is 700 scrolls to the right somewhere.</li>
    <li>Without you wanting to do anything the flash does &#8220;stuff&#8221; either it moves stuff or about 900 images are scrolling by fast and then slow and then the other way like some sort of game that depends on where your mouse is in the window seeming to have not a whole lot of correlation to actually wanting that to happen.</li>
    <li>No back buttons - no browser controls whatsoever. A completely new and devilishly complex UI invented by who the F knows who.</li>
    <li>Idiotically tiny tiny images so they do not get &#8220;stolen&#8221; as if a 600 pixel or 700 pixel image is SOOOOO MUCH more &#8220;steal-able&#8221; than a 200 or 300 pixel image.</li>
    <li>Half the time they execute the ol&#8217; let&#8217;s make the browser window full screen to display the 300 pixel image.</li>
    <li>Thumbnails that are really hard to even differentiate one image to the next in most cases.</li>
</ol>


<p>Hey I get how elegant a lot of white space is - I really do. But there are degree&#8217;s of it that are totally forked up. Like printing a 3 foot by 4 foot book and showing 4inch by 6 inch images one on each page. Can someone please explain why 90% of photographers do this? - not just the lousy ones. Do they really think that this is the way the web works. or should work? Please, please.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. Maybe that is why I don&#8217;t have an on-line portfolio.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/GLMedia_2005_07_24_92.jpg"><img title="GLMedia_2005_07_24_92.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/.thumbs/.GLMedia_2005_07_24_92.jpg" border="0" alt="GLMedia_2005_07_24_92.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="99" height="150" align="left" /></a>I don&#8217;t talk about Aperture adjustments much but I had an Aperture user email me about two specific Aperture adjustments and some issues that he was having. What I suggested to him was actually a work-flow solution. Well a work-flow solution and a photographic philosophy solution as well. He was a Nikon shooter but this tip applies to a way to approach things for just about any kind of shooter. In fact it maybe something you should think about even if you don&#8217;t use Aperture.</p>

<p>Remember the old days when film had one or maybe two &#8220;white balance&#8221; settings? Tungsten or Daylight. You loaded up and shot. If you were a color negative shooter - don&#8217;t worry your lab will get it right, especially if you have a close relationship and they know how you like your color to look. If you were a slide shooter you filtered for the situation. Nice and simple. I suggest you take a similar approach with digital white balance. Not exactly but similar. Like most things in the automatic digital world - there are a lot of automated things that I consider specialized tools that have somehow found their way into the default way of doing things. Auto white balance is one of them - it causes more trouble than it is worth in a lot of situations. Most actually.</p>

<p>Like most Nikon shooters - this Aperture user did not like the default rendering of his NEF files in Aperture - white balance was one issue. Here is the solution. Don&#8217;t use auto white balance, especially if you shoot RAW. Pick a white balance preset - either daylight or cloudy or whatever. I actually use the little kelvin numbers because that is the language I am so used to. Pick it based on how you want your scene rendered and go with it. Don&#8217;t change it until your<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/GLMedia_2005_07_24_66.jpg"><img title="GLMedia_2005_07_24_66.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/.thumbs/.GLMedia_2005_07_24_66.jpg" border="0" alt="GLMedia_2005_07_24_66.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="99" height="150" align="right" /></a> scene changes.</p>

<p>Doing this does two things. The first is that it gives you a WB that you might like - in my case I usually shoot in daylight WB and happen to be in either warm or cool light depending on the mood I am going for. If I want to warm it up a bit I crank the WB up in Kelvin numbers if I want to cool it down I do the opposite. Fantastic my JPEGS look like I want them to look right out of the camera.</p>

<p>The second and more important thing it does for you is gives you a series of images that have the same exact color temps and color renderings. If you shoot RAW this situation is far far better than having a series of images that are all over the map by a few K here and there. Even if you preset WB is a little wrong - or completely wrong. You make one adjustment and stamp it to every other image. Want a couple renderings? Make a couple of different adjustments and stamp them to every image with new versions in different albums. This takes all of 2 seconds vs going through and screwing with WB individually for every image in a sequence.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/GLMedia_2005_07_24_82.jpg"><img title="GLMedia_2005_07_24_82.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/.thumbs/.GLMedia_2005_07_24_82.jpg" border="0" alt="GLMedia_2005_07_24_82.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="99" height="150" align="left" /></a>Better yet if you are a Nikon shooter you can pick a WB setting that you KNOW the exact correction for to match your NX2 interpretation and stamp that saved correction to every thing you shoot - or have a couple of them as starting points for different settings. Trust me on this - the usefulness of auto white balance is limited to a narrow range of shooting circumstances no matter how &#8220;good&#8221; the auto white balance is. Minor variations in WB shot to shot sucks.</p>

<p>Oh - Aperture noise reduction is not for any time of complex noise. It does not work anything like Noise Ninja or Nik Noise reduction software. If you are a noise nazi you will probably want to buy one of these tools. I happen to prefer Nik but rarely use it. I find that if I like an image I like it noise or not. Then again my noise is never really &#8220;bad&#8221; I sort of subconsciously compensate for the fact that I know it will have noise and put it where it doesn&#8217;t matter - or at least maters less. I guess that comes from decades of shooting high speed color neg film where you had to do this.</p>

<p>These images are just some crap that I used to illustrate the point - This is a preset WB in a very tricky WB situation. They were shot on the worlds worst NEF interpretation in Aperture on a camera that has worse noise than anything you can buy today. The were shot at ISO 800 on a D2H. That camera was fantastic but at ISO 800 it was like a new camera cranked all the way up as far as the ISO can go - or worse. You may not like my choice of WB setting but that is not the point - you can apply ONE correction to every image in this sequence and be done.</p>

<p>It has from a good source that the Apple event will include iTablet, iLife 10, iPhone OS4 but no word on Aperture 3 - God damn it. I am starting to get really really mad now. Something - please just something. I cannot stand the anticipation. It&#8217;s killing me.</p>

<p>I get this way before any Apple event - even if I don&#8217;t get my Aperture 3 I am sure I will get some shiny new object to keep me distracted for a while longer but let&#8217;s all hope we get something, even if it&#8217;s just a rename from Aperture 2 to iAperture &#8216;10. Maybe then Apple will remember it exists. The trend is that any product - hardware or software does not get a whole lotta Apple love if it does not start with an i. My theory is if it at least get&#8217;s renamed to iAperture that Apple will accidentally upgrade it more frequently just because it will get lumped in with all the other iProducts that get revisions, upgrades and features about every 20 or 25 minutes.</p>
