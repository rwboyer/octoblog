  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2001_019_05.jpg"><img title="2001_019_05.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2001_019_05.jpg" border="0" alt="2001_019_05.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" align="left" /></a>Just another in my series of shooting real film. This time Ilford PanF Plus, developed in PMK pyro. I was playing with this for a little while to see if it could do duty as my slow, sharp, fine grained film. The brief answer is no. At the time and still to this day I think Kodak TMAX 100 blows it out of the water in every way, including aesthetics. PanF does nothing for better than TMAX (or Delta 100 for that matter) and a whole lot of things way worse.</p>

<p>Here is the brief rundown. Yes it is sharp and fine grained but it has so many faults with no redeeming factors. It is really slow, so slow in the shadows that it is more like using Agfa APX 25 or Kodak Panatomic X. In fact I would prefer either of those to the Pan F. Combine this characteristic with the fact that it shoulders off so fast in the highlights it is more like using an ortho film or Tech Pan and it really sucks. To explain this in english not only is it not 50 speed when trying to retain shadow detail in zone III it blocks up very easily either via exposure or development. When I say it blocks up I really mean that, it doesn&#8217;t just get denser and denser like TMAX does while retaining detail, it goes to maximum density really quick and that is all she wrote - no more detail - no more differentiation. Done, blown. TMAX 100 on the other hand will get really dense but continues to add more and more density so the detail is there even if it is hard for newbies to get detail in the highlights. Completely different.<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/panf100.jpg"><img title="panf100.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.panf100.jpg" border="0" alt="panf100.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="118" height="150" align="right" /></a></p>

<p>Honestly I have no idea why Ilford continues to make this stuff (I think they do). I have no idea why they made it in the 90&#8217;s when I tested it. For that matter I have no idea why Agfa and Kodak couldn&#8217;t make money with their slow films like APX 25 and Panatomic X verses this crap. At least those two had redeeming qualities. Yes I know that all really slow films act like I describe more than faster films but having a lot of experience with Panatomic X and APX 25 and the supposedly evil but actually fantastic TMAX I can say that Pan F was ridiculous and virtually useless even after taking the time to calibrate it. I would never use it for plus development - useless.</p>

It is still drying. If there is anything remotely reproducible/scannable I will post it in an update. This time around it was 8 year old TRI-X. Fog, and guess what edge burning and general look as though I opened the camera with the film still loaded. This time it is worse.</p>

<p>Could it be that this is the reason that this particular roll went unprocessed? Maybe but I am thinking that the tank that I am using has a light leak because the exposure pattern is the same as that roll of TMZ. After studying the edge burn pattern the evidence is inconclusive but I am changing tanks for the the next run. Â Am I deterred? Nope - I have plenty of really old unprocessed film laying around to make sure my process is back up and running correctly. That and I am curious to see what the heck was on this film that I decided not to<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/badtx100.jpg"><img title="badtx100.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.badtx100.jpg" border="0" alt="badtx100.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="107" align="right" /></a> process it at the time.</p>

<p>I really doubt I pulled the dumb-ass mistake of opening the camera back more than once with film still loaded. It is possible but I think that I would remember that. Stay tuned.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2009_001_01.jpg"><img title="2009_001_01.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2009_001_01.jpg" border="0" alt="2009_001_01.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="left" /></a>Well, I decided to put my money where my mouth is and shoot more film prior to taking the M9 plunge. I really haven&#8217;t shot film in the last two years since my last move. Well I did shoot some medium format but that was color and was not my M series Leica. In preparation to start shooting seriously with the M series I ordered up a fresh batch of developer and fixer from Photographers Forumulary and it arrived today.</p>

<p>To warm up the old darkroom skills I figured that I would round up a bunch of old unprocessed film that I seem to have accumulated. Don&#8217;t ask - there are a million reasons that I have unprocessed rolls of film laying around. I started with one that I knew would be a bear. TMZ shot at 1600 in 2002 - at least that is when I wrote the date on it. The results were absolutely horrible, probably the worst thing that has ever come out of the tank. That includes worse than my very first roll of film developed when I was like 13 years old in the parents basement. I did figure out why this roll was not ever processed, which at least satisfies my curiosity.</p>

<p>The reason that this particular roll was not processed was that it is fairly obvious that I opened the camera while there was still film in the camera - ooooops. I am sentimental, I kept it so that I could process it when I wasn&#8217;t so backed up with &#8220;real&#8221; photographic work just to see. Well that was seven years after. The list of issues goes on from there. Â The fog is so bad that you can&#8217;t even see through the film - it is now &#8220;frosted&#8217; instead of transparent.<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/badtmz.jpg"><img title="badtmz.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.badtmz.jpg" border="0" alt="badtmz.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="147" align="right" /></a> It has grain that nobody could love - either that or the coating has reticulation from some abuse over the last 7 years that I forgot about it or I screwed the pooch with temp control and shocked it into reticulation. In any case I am not at all deterred. Well I am a little deterred, namely I am not going to shoot any of the expired TMZ that I have - that is headed for posterity labeled &#8220;DO NOT SHOOT - IT WILL LOOK HORRIBLE&#8221;.</p>

<p>I will keep you up to date on the M series quest - I am going to shoot the M at least as much as I shoot digital for the rest of the year to make sure that I really really want a digital M.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/sc1.jpg"><img title="sc1.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.sc1.jpg" border="0" alt="sc1.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="146" height="150" align="left" /></a>This image is about 6&#8221; wide. It was shot on 120 medium format film. That&#8217;s a magnification factor of 2.7 give or take. It&#8217;s fantastically detailed and reasonably sharp. It looks even better on paper because on paper it will be 3 to 6 times the resolution that you can see on your monitor at 100 dpi or so. So how many megapixels is that? It really doesn&#8217;t matter as long as you can get about 250 - 300 dpi on paper. Your magnification may be greater because you probably have a sensor that is DX or FX sized (Nikon speak for APS-C and Full frame 35mm) so your magnification would be like a factor of 6 shooting full frame 35mm.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s all that mean. Well it means if most of the stuff you ever print or display is about 6&#8221; up and down you are great with about 2.5 megapixels - seriously. Oh but I want to display it on my HD TV okay - you need about hmm, 2.5 megapixels for that you can do that math to show you how big a really good print you can get is. What do you get with more megapixels? You get the ability to make bigger prints, that&#8217;s it. At the same time you do get to look at how lousy your technique is, how bad your lens is, and clog up your harddrive faster. What happens when you look at a 12 megapixel image at 100% in your favorite software assuming it was taken on a full frame or 35mm device? Well you get to simulate what a 30&#8221;x45&#8221; print looks like at about a foot away - more importantly you are looking at your image at a factor of 30 magnification. Let&#8217;s go for the gold and do the same thing shot on a 25 megapixel D3x for $8000. Now we are looking at a print about 40&#8221;x60&#8221; print at 40x magnification.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s see how my crappy old film image holds up looking at a 40&#8221; print. Wow! amazing - that is like a giant print I will lay down money that it fares better than the D3x at the same print sizes. Why you ask? The answer is that magnification factor that I keep mentioning. <a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/sc2.jpg"><img title="sc2.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.sc2.jpg" border="0" alt="sc2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="146" height="150" align="right" /></a>You see 25 megapixels at 100% on an FX sensor is 40x, about the same as the microscope shots that they used to put in all the photo magazines to test lenses and films and such. That magnification factor is pretty important when revealing lens flaws, technique flaws, etc. My crappy old medium format negative at 40x would be like 8 feet wide a whole lot bigger before those same technique and lens flaws started showing up.</p>

<p>Here is my money saving tip for those with gear lust - before you upgrade megapixels (assuming you have something that is already enough) ask yourself what the purpose is? Are you going to make giant prints? If so by all means upgrade but also realize that you really really have to upgrade your technique by a large factor when you get more pixels - maybe your lenses to. If you are not really focusing very critically forget lenses. If you are handholding your shots at anything but stratospheric shutter speeds, forget lenses. I am telling you from decades of practical experience here that to up the quality of your game it takes a lot of effort and time on your part. If you have any hope of seeing bigger and better prints in terms of quality you really need to completely change the things that have to do with the way you focus, expose, and shoot prior to upping your magnification (megapixels). You may actually be far better off with less magnification.</p>

<p>If you do want to make the occasional really fantastic large print look into film, even medium format film. Use it when you really want to concentrate on making photographs. The kind of kit that you can pickup now in 6x6 or 6x4.5 for chump change is absolutely mind numbing. Hasselblad/Zeiss for $1500 that looks like it was never used with the latest (or next to it) CF/CFi lenses. Bronica ETRsi for those that like to hand hold full kits with a couple of backs and a lens or two - $500. I have even seen some Hasselblad H1 film kits with backs, prism, body, and a lens go for $2000. I promise you that this stuff will blow the crap out of a 25 megapixel full frame 35mm body. Don&#8217;t like the grain/noise - well that&#8217;s fine considering you can only see it in a 40&#8221; print like shown here and that is 400 speed black and white old tech film. If you are looking to up the ante in your print size/quality it is a far less costly and more productive route - and actually a little easier than going with more megapixels at higher magnifications. You will have to shoot a heck of a lot of film to make up the cost.</p>

<p>The two brands that I mentioned I can vouch for personally in terms of consistent quality, esp the Hasselblad and Zeiss CFi stuff. Just something to think about. The really funny thing is that this particular negative is just a casual working shot that I happen to be printing out for a book concept that I am working on, not like a demo quality negative. It was shot at 1/8 second without mirror lockup on a 503/CW - translation = bad news if you really want critical sharpness and detail.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/IDPDFblurb.jpg"><img title="IDPDFblurb.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.IDPDFblurb.jpg" border="0" alt="IDPDFblurb.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="134" align="left" /></a>Been doing a lot of correspondence lately with some poor souls that are lost in the evil wilderness between color management hocus-pocus, the bizarre alternate reality that is Aperture printing behavior, and Blurb.com. I hope that I didn&#8217;t come off sounding dismissive of good color management practices or someone that thinks sRGB is the end all be all. I am not and have been dealing with end to end color management since the dark ages when it was &#8220;hard&#8221;.</p>

<p>Most of the time color management should be easy nowadays as I explain in <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2008/04/16/color-management-and-other-stupid-internet-tricks/">this rant from a while ago</a>.Â Let me try to set a couple of things strait and convey some useful info as well. I will start out by saying that Aperture printing is hopelessly broken in a lot of cases. I say this because a lot of readers are Aperture users. I personally think that it is shameful that Apple&#8217;s &#8220;pro&#8221; image application is so prone to producing really bad prints through no fault of the users. The big issue here is that quite a substantial number of Aperture users follow what are perfectly reasonable color management paths then go to make a print from Aperture and it is horrible. After trying 72 different random settings with no real improvement except in the rare case that 42 wrongs add up to make a right, they turn to the web for answers.</p>

<p>On the quest for answers they pickup all kinds of voodoo mixed in with fantastically detailed and idiotically low level technical information (mostly related to CMYK 4 color processes) from the probably brilliant but obtuse likes of Heinrick Heimlichk over on the apple board and such. They end up with a hopelessly confused color paranoia at then end of it when the real answer is A - Aperture printing is broken and B - there is not a lot of practical &#8220;how to&#8221; information out there.</p>

<p>In cases where Aperture is producing a print that is obviously wrong and you are sure you did everything right (I will spare you the details they are all over the place on choosing the correct paper/printer profile) here is what I have done with limited success to &#8220;fix&#8221; it.</p>

<p>1) Trash the Aperture printing preferences.</p>

<p>2) Go download the absolutely latest driver for your printer from the manufacturer (this matters a lot)</p>

<p>3) Reinstall the printer driver.</p>

<p>4) Try it again making sure all of the settings in Aperture print dialog and the OS dialog match and make sense.</p>

<p>If this doesn&#8217;t work you are probably out of luck printing from Aperture and using &#8220;good&#8221; color management practices until either Apple or the printer manufacturer releases updates that happen to fix your issue - these are rarely labeled with &#8220;fixes Aperture print issue&#8221; tags. Trust me on this a driver from Canon that was released in early 2009 did produced really bad results with Aperture (only Aperture) and the same exact driver released in June worked fine with no mention of anything remotely related as changes or fixes.</p>

<p>Okay, moving on to dealing with color management, profiles, etc no matter what your preferred software is. There are a couple of practical tips that I want to address here some of which are technically not &#8220;correct&#8221; and if you are someone that has been dealing with color management and conversion for years in the commercial world I am sure you will argue the special cases with me - please don&#8217;t. If you are a photographer that wants to get good prints and are having some issues or just want to make them a little better - this may be for you.</p>

<p>There are two different cases of profile conversions that you need to concern yourself with. The first one is converting an image file from one color space/profile to another in order to meet some other outside parties specifications and ensure that you are doing the conversion that you want and NOT using the other parties default conversion settings. This is important, really important if you care about color and controlling how your images look. I cannot stress enough how important this is even if the third party is &#8220;color managed&#8221;. Here is why - Let&#8217;s say you have an image that is in Adobe RGB color space and you &#8220;soft proof&#8221; it on your calibrated screen. Fantastic and things will most like likely turn out okay if you send your images and it&#8217;s profile to this outside provider/partner/whatever that will ultimately be converted into the color space for whatever the intent is (printing, projection, web, etc). This is probably what 99% of the world does and is generally okay but it is not at all okay if you really want to control and understand the results. Here is why - the proof and conversion settings maybe wildly different even if the profiles are exactly the same and that difference can be anything from about the same to catastrophically different. The two main conversion settings that are likely to vary are the &#8220;black point compensation&#8221; and the &#8220;rendering intent&#8221;. If you do not think these matter a lot switch them back and forth/on and off while looking at a soft proof - still not convinced - make two prints with opposite settings.</p>

<p>Even if your settings are the same things can still go wrong because &#8220;black point compensation&#8221; is not a standard it is an algorithm that may vary from color conversion engine to color conversion engine. Same thing with the rendering intent &#8220;perceptual&#8221; - not a standard. The bottom line is if you care you will do the conversion yourself so no conversion happens on the other side.</p>

<p>The second and very closely related color space conversions that you will be doing are the conversion to make a print on your own printer in the print settings dialog. Here is a clue - use the same settings to print that you used to soft proof on your screen. In Aperture this is an issue because you can choose the profile but you cannot choose the rendering intent or black point compensation. Same deal with printing in Aperture except you get to choose black point compensation this time. Another reason Aperture printing is hopelessly broken and unacceptable at this state of the game. For those of you wondering - as far as I know the rendering intent in Aperture is &#8220;relative colormetric&#8221; - not a bad thing actually.</p>

<p>So what settings should you use for converting files and/or printing - the good news is that they are usually relative colormetric and black point compensation turned on. The better news is in 99.9% of all cases these are the &#8220;best&#8221; settings for photographs in both printing and file conversion situations. The only other setting that you may want to use for photographs is &#8220;perceptual&#8221;, the reason you may want to use this is if significant areas - especially if they are adjacent to each other - are out of the target color gamut. In other words the color space that you are converting to cannot reproduce the colors in your image. How do you know if they are out of gamut - you need software that shows you like Photoshop. As far as I can tell Aperture has no way of showing you what colors are out of gamut in a target colorspace. Not good.</p>

<p>I guess that brings us to why I recommended Aperture users just sending sRGB to blurb.com - Well to make it easy. Most of your images - if they are like my images will not have a significant gamut issues in the conversion from Adobe 1998 to sRGB and you can actually see what that conversion will look like without anything special just by looking at them on your computer vs. sending them a wider gamut profile like Adobe RGB and having no idea what the conversion at blub will look like. Reason two is there is no way to do the conversion to the HP Indigo CMYK profile from within Aperture. Sure you can look at it using Apertures fixed soft proof settings - by all means do that but you cannot do the conversion within Aperture. Three blurb.com has tons of experience and satisfied customers that send them sRGB and the conversion settings they use are about as good as you are going to get, there is no reason to send them wider gamut RGB files as all of them go sRGB first (they say so) - you just don&#8217;t get to see them first.</p>

<p>For those of you wishing a finer degree of control over the output the recipe is Photoshop to view gamut warnings, Photoshop to soft proof the conversions and parameters, Photoshop for the conversions and parameters. Then InDesign for the layout. Sure you can do all the Photoshop conversions but why the hell would you want to import CMYK PSD&#8217;s back into Aperture trust me it will import them but Aperture wreaks havoc on them when you try to export them with the source profile. I don&#8217;t even want to try to figure out what the hell isgoing on here it would be an intellectual exercise that leads nowhere with a bunch of model and space conversion going on just to use the Aperture book tool pretty much canceling out all of that fine degree of control you were after in the first place. <a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/ApCMYK.jpg"><img title="ApCMYK.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.ApCMYK.jpg" border="0" alt="ApCMYK.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="95" height="150" align="right" /></a>The attached image is what happens to a when you try to export a TIFF from aperture using a CMYK PSD and a CMYK profile - I cannot even begin to explain what the hell Aperture is doing nor why they would allow you to import it in the first place considering ALL CMYK COLOR MODELS ARE DEVICE DEPENDENT. The funny thing is that it does work to export to an RGB color profile - how useless is that for managing your color very precisely at the source?</p>

<p>I hope that this helps some of you out with both Blurb.com, deciding on a tool set to use for your book project, and Aperture printing. One final word of advise if you are choosing InDesign for your blurb.com layout tool and are processing your final images in Photoshop and using the CMYK profile blurb.com provides: The default color settings in InDesign will not work - you much change them to use attached CMYK profiles versus retain CMYK numbers.</p>

Not really my taste in the specific treatment of the negatives (this was done on film) but the images are great and as I said a fantastic example. If this is the kind of thing (range and proximity) of things you like to shoot. The M9 or M6 or M3 may be the camera for you. If you are too lazy to process and scan film then definitely the M9. This image is not from the book it is one of my old ones. M6 50 Summicron, Â TMAX 400.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I cannot believe that this subject is so popular. I also cannot believe that so many people are so paranoid of an sRGB output. I guess I am glad to see a lot of interest in printing and I think both Apple books and Blurb.com are a fantastic way to showcase your work - far better than just jamming them up on the web.</p>

<p>Let me get to the point - I have made blurb books from Aperture and I am pretty certain based on my experience with a lot of digital and traditional printing that there will be no difference with an sRGB output vs a CMYK output. A reader asked if I had hard evidence. The answer to that is no but I would be willing to shed a couple of bucks if there really are a bunch of people interested in hard evidence between an Aperture sRGB/Booksmart sRGB workflow and a full-blown Adobe InDesign CMYK workflow using the blurb.com supplied CMYK/HP Indigo profile.</p>

<p>I happen to be handy with both and since I am planning a new book about my local neighborhood area sooner or later I will be happy to conduct a head to head comparison if there are people that would benefit from this.</p>

<p>Here is the deal - leave a comment on this post if you want to see a head to head comparison. If there are more than 10 people interested I will spend the time and money to do a cage match of sorts. Do me a favor and let me know what books/subject matter you are planning with what type of medium as well so I can try to cover the bases in terms of workflow/color management/image types and associated colors.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A long long time ago I put up a couple of posts about a couple of ways to use Aperture&#8217;s easy to use but completely undocumented book layout tool for just about any book printing service. I guess all of a sudden these services have become far more popular and hence I have receive a bunch of questions specifically related to blurb.com and Aperture. Instead of trying to recap all of the information exchanged I am just going to give a couple of guidelines to help point people interested in this the right way.</p>

<p>Just to summarize, there are two general approaches to dealing with other 3rd party print services using Aperture. The first and really simple way is to using one of the PDF to image options in the book printing menu and then place those images of the actual pages using the services layout facilities such as Blurb&#8217;s BookSmart. For a while this was the only way to do it with blurb.com. The other way was to print to a PDF of the correct specifications for the book service. So one - print from Aperture ending up with JPG or TIFF images of the pages or two - print from Aperture ending up with a PDF.</p>

<p>In both of these cases I suggested using a custom automator workflow added to the PDF services with Aperture so that you could control the specs. These are easy enough to create by copying the ones already there and modifying them with the Automator tool. The whats, wheres, and hows are detailed in one of the other posts in this series. Here are a couple of considerations when doing this.</p>

<p>First off both approaches need a custom book theme - unless you do not want precise layout within the services formats you need to be using a custom them with the correct page and margin dimensions. In most cases this means existing books using built-in Aperture book themes will not work. This is not always the case. Some books have a bunch of white space around all of the page edges and would be fine cropped somewhat. Get the page and margin dimensions from blurb or other service. One other thing you probably want to do for either approach is to set up the printer in the Aperture book printing dialog for borderless printing.</p>

<p>The next thing that you need to pay attention to is the specifications of the files you are sending. That is why I recommended the customized automator PDF workflows for either images or PDFs. The first thing is the color model and color profile. As of right now you will be much better making sure your images whether PDF or PDF to TIFF/JPG are sRGB. This is not the case for the default workflows included with Mac OS X and Aperture. For instance using the built-in PDF-X workflow the embedded image files will be Adobe RGB. Don&#8217;t believe me? Check them out for yourself. Don&#8217;t know how to check them ? - definitely use sRGB.</p>

<p>Here is why for all of you color management pro wanna-be&#8217;s out there. Let&#8217;s take blurb.com. Their entire production workflow and hardware is optimized for sRGB. Just look at the little color space diagram they give you in their help section. Blurb goes on to tell you that if you are sending RGB image files to send them sRGB, not Adobe RGB or ProPhoto, or, etc, etc. After that they state that if you really really really want to send them something else to make yourself feel better send them a very specific CMYK profile for the HP equipment they use. That means you need images in the CMYK color MODEL and then convert them to the CMYK profile that they supply. First off if you are using Aperture you not only don&#8217;t have CMYK images you can&#8217;t have them - Aperture does not do this. Second there is NO reason you would want to with the minor exception of already having an InDesign document and images already in CMYK that you already use to deal with real process color printing presses. That is the only reason in which case you have no reason to be trying to do this from Aperture.</p>

<p>Why am I so viciously adamant on this? Because I want to leave no room for misinterpretation that people working in Aperture or Photoshop or anything else for that matter that are not dealing with CMYK printing presses have no need to deal with CMYK color models. That and I want to leave no room for misinterpretation that your output from blurb.com will be NO BETTER going through creating and probably screwing up your images/files to CMYK. Stop worrying.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/DSC_0393_1.jpg"><img title="DSC_0393_1.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.DSC_0393_1.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_0393_1.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="101" align="left" /></a>As most of you know I am not a landscape guy. Don&#8217;t have the patience for it but If I happen to be there, sure I&#8217;ll give it a shot. That happens very rarely, especially where I live. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, the bay and surrounding area are quite beautiful but if there is nothing in the sky it is kind of flat and very difficult to get a good landscape image that represents the feeling of the place. I have been working on a super secret project this summer - eventually it will be a book about the area. Not just the landscape but of the people, etc. in and around the area. I am going to try to get this done by next year. Hey I live here so why not.</p>

<p>On to the photos. Yesterday was a horrible day, storms rain, clouds but I had my antennae up because when that kind of crap starts to breakup it is usually a photographic gold mine no matter what the time of day. It&#8217;s good right before it starts as well but I was asleep. Real landscape photographers go somewhere and wait for things like this. Me, I&#8217;m good if it is outside my front door. So early evening yesterday I look out my window and wham the storm started to breakup. I swear 10 minutes before this the sky was completely grey - not a good grey a flat plain ugly grey. Now the light was perfect on boats in the harbor and the clouds and colors unbelievable. I grabbed my camera and literally ran out my front door 200 or so yards to the harbor. I could see the light on the boats and the water quickly moving off of them. I fired off 2 or 3 quick shots, ran about 25 yards up the cliff a little so I could shoot a little wider without brush in the foreground. Fired of 2 more shots and it was over. The light vanished. This was the best I could do.</p>

<p>The shot at the top of the post was the last shot I took before the boats and water went dead. This shot was the first one I took. They are probably about 2 minutes apart at the most and are not as good as the ones would have been when I looked out my window.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/DSC_0378_1.jpg"><img title="DSC_0378_1.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.DSC_0378_1.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_0378_1.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="101" align="left" /></a></p>

<p>Simple post processing, nature took care of the colors for me. No kidding. Shot on a Nikon D200 with 12-24. RAW processed in ACR using a D2X mode three camera profile (a little less saturated than picture profile &#8220;standard&#8221;) and a daylight white balance. Minor dodge and burn in Photoshop CS4. Resized for your viewing pleasure.</p>

<p>Landscape people out there let me know what you think. Most of my stuff for the project is architecture, people, informal portraits, environmental, so I jump when I can do a local landscape.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/2000_006_01_low_res.jpg"><img title="2000_006_01_low_res.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.2000_006_01_low_res.jpg" border="0" alt="2000_006_01_low_res.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="102" align="left" /></a>This film was one of the few modern black and white triumphs of Kodak. It is actually unbelievable. I have shot a ton of this stuff in both 35mm and medium format. I really was not that interested in the TMAX line when it appeared on the scene. Of course I did some cursory tests of TMX and it&#8217;s siblings to get a feel for it but I never really dove in until availability of Agfa APX 25 started to become a problem in the states and ultimately disappeared. I loved APX 25 for certain subjects and for those subjects I had hard won proficiency that I was not willing to give up so easily. When the writing was on the wall of APX 25&#8217;s demise I started searching in earnest for a replacement. After much shooting, testing, calibrating and evaluation turns out that Ilford PanF plus did not cut it but the big surprise was that TMX was a more than worthy replacement.</p>

<p>Opinions will vary but in my eyes Agfa APX was not only a technically fabulous film but it was also a very &#8220;beautiful&#8221; film. This may get me lynched but I found that TMX was even more technically fabulous, much faster, and every bit as &#8220;beautiful&#8221; in every single way. The two are probably more alike than different. The reason saying this may get me kicked out of the Agfa APX 25 fan club is APX 25 not only had a cult following, it&#8217;s legend and fervent followers became bigger after it was gone. Poor old TMX on the other hand is not only still available just about everywhere but it also got a reputation for being &#8220;picky&#8221; and hard to deal with. I never found this to be the case.</p>

<p>TMAX 100 is actually not only pretty reasonable but extremely flexible in terms of contrast manipulation. What that means is that you can get any negative contrast index you want out of it. It also means that you cannot underexpose it and over develop it and get a normal negative. I guess this is what TMX haters were talking about but hey - the behavior is pretty much the same only more flexible with a wider range of contrasts than Ilford PanF, Agfa APX 25, and Agfa APX 100. TMX is actually better &#8220;behaved&#8221; than Kodak Panatomic X in my humble opinion.</p>

<p>The image at the top of the post was shot on TMX developed N in TMAX with a Nikon F2 105 Micro at 1/125s f2.8. Here are a couple unsharpened views of a 4000 dpi scan so that you can see the detail this film is capable of and the virtually non-existant grain structure.</p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/tmx_bridge.jpg"><img title="tmx_bridge.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.tmx_bridge.jpg" border="0" alt="tmx_bridge.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="94" /></a></p>

<p>Note the idiotically shallow depth of field. Here is a better view of the grain structure. If you know black and white film you know this is quite amazing - if you don&#8217;t take my word for it.</p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/tmx_bridge_2.jpg"><img title="tmx_bridge_2.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/.thumbs/.tmx_bridge_2.jpg" border="0" alt="tmx_bridge_2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="94" /></a></p>

<p>To wrap this up, TMAX 100 is a both technically a fantastic film as well as a film with a lot of &#8220;beauty&#8221;. You can make prints from 35mm that look like they were shot on medium format. On medium format you would have a very difficult time telling the difference from a 4x5 view camera print. Great stuff, pretty fast compared to anything else in it&#8217;s class. I prefer it over Ilford Delta 100 by a mile and although I am sad not to have Agfa APX 25 (from Agfa or Rollei) around I really do not miss it since discovering TMX was a superior film in virtually every way.</p>

<p>One word of warning, I have not tried the new TMAX 400 but the old stuff had nothing in common with TMAX 100. It&#8217;s actually funny that TMX, TMY, and TMZ were in the same Kodak family - they are nothing like each other. Maybe I will get around to trying the new and improved TMY sooner or later.</p>
