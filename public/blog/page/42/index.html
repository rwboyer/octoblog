  <div class="entry-content"><p>A short while ago I wrote something about image magnification, film scanning, sharpening etc. The <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2009/10/02/megapixels-image-magnification-and-why-you-probably-dont-need-a-new-camera/">original post</a> was making a point that looking at some of the unsharpened film scans at 100% that I presented while discussing various characteristics of film has nothing to do with image sharpness on the film, in any reasonable sized print, or in comparison with any DX/FX sized camera sensor available.</p>

<p>I also made a point that consumer digital capture has a long way to go and may never get to a place that is easy to get with medium format film. The point that I was making was not anything aesthetic, although I could argue about that as well, the point was all about image magnification and why lower image magnification = better. The way that I explained it caused some confusion and conversation with a couple of readers so I thought I might try to clarify the whole image magnification thing one more time.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s forget about pixels for a second and talk just about the size of the capture medium vs the size of the final output product. If you have an FX or 35mm sized capture device, be it digital or film, and make an 8 inch wide print that corresponds to the short side of your sensor the magnification will be about 8x - end of story. This is because the short side of that capture medium is about 1&#8221; by 1.5&#8221; Â on the long end (not being exact, just making things simple), hence if you make it 8 inches that will be 8 times as big. Very simple. Let&#8217;s say that your capture medium is perfect - your sensor or film has no flaws. Every other flaw in the image making process will be magnified by 8x - movement, vibration, imperfect focus, lens flaws, etc. etc. Yes I know that movement and vibration are affected by focal magnification as well but all else being equal they will all be magnified by that amount. Also realize that there is no such thing as depth of field when talking about perfect focus - there is exactly right focus and varying degrees of out of focus. The more the magnification the more you can see them - yes the &#8220;varying degrees of out of focus&#8221; also depends on aperture but at the end of the day what is acceptable depth of field is also governed by image magnification.</p>

<p>Here is the part where I confused some people in my original post. I brought pixels and dpi into the conversation. The only thing that pixels and dpi have to do with anything related to image magnification is when you also start talking about viewing at &#8220;100%&#8221; on your output medium. This is what everybody does to judge image quality, they view all of the pixels at a one to one ratio with their screen - 100%. So let us bring megapixels into our little example - say I have a Nikon D3 12 megapixel camera with an FX sized sensor and I view it at 100%. Assuming you and I have a normal modern monitor we have an output device that is really close to 100 pixels per inch. So we are now going to be viewing 2,832 pixels at 100 pixels per inch or&#8230; something 28 inches tall - just a section of it. Using our 3rd grade math skills that would be an image magnification of, hmmmm 28x.</p>

<p>Are we good so far? That 28x is like really, really microscope-ish. To tell you the truth things really start to fall apart at a close viewing distance at maybe 10x or 15x - if you are far away they will still be fine but close up they fall apart. Now let&#8217;s say that we keep the same lenses, and more importantly the same shooting technique and conditions. Same flash units whatever but we buy ourselves a brand spanking new Nikon D3x with a small size pixel dimension of Â 4,032. Woo hoooo our stuff is going to be so much better - wrong. It will probably be about the same but now when we go look at it at 100% we get to see it at 40x magnification - gee golly. Now we are well into microscope territory and I can bet you your focus sucks, autofocus sucks, your lenses suck - oh and your shooting technique and conditions really really suck at 40x.</p>

<p>When you are getting more megapixels you are getting the ability to magnify more with out your pixels turning into squares but you are doing nothing about the magnification factor that will always be a killer depending on your output intent and viewing distances. Hey if you are a hundred yards away you can output billboard sized stuff and it will look fantastic. Now if we get back into practical sized stuff that we deal with close up - how big do you want to go and how good do you want it to look. Just about anything looks great at 4x and below, I really do mean just about anything. Reasonably competent stuff looks good up to about 8x. I am talking about really close up.</p>

<p>Beyond 8x and technique, lenses, etc, etc become much more critical. For instance I was shooting some fashion stuff a long time ago with my lighting kit that is perfectly fine and plenty powerful. The problem was I was shooting on medium format for something that involved a lot of action and the target display size was going to be about 20x. Guess what - my flashes had a duration of 1/750 second - pretty fast but at 20x you could see motion ghosting in the models hair. Not good for what the job was. I had to spend a ton of money on some profoto packs and heads just to get a flash duration of 1/2000s to make the ghosting go away. The images would have been perfectly fine at 10x. If I could have I would have shot it on 4x5 but there was no way to do that and get the job done in any reasonable amount of time - if ever. I definitely needed to shoot more than a frame or two to nail the shot.</p>

<p>Fast forward to my posts and medium format film - when I scan medium format film that has a short side of 9000 pixels and show you an unsharpened &#8220;100%&#8221; view you are seeing a piece of something that is 90 inches wide from a foot away or&#8230; 40x magnification. Ta&#8230;.Da&#8230;. Something that most of you have never seen - a 40x magnification of something under a microscope that was hand held shot in available light at 1/125 second at f4 and quickly manually focused on 400 speed black and white film. In the real world of stuff we might make with that negative like a big book it will not only look fantastic but quite possibly look better than anything shot on a smaller format no matter what the pixel count because of the fact for the real world stuff the magnification will be lower due to the larger capture device.</p>

<p>I hope I did not confuse the matter even more. Bottom line - when making pictures image magnification counts a lot - the lower the better - not just pixel count. In fact unless you are actually running into issues where you need to make images bigger and do not have enough pixels to do so than they don&#8217;t do much. As for cropping - sure go ahead but not too much - no matter how many pixels you have to crop out of, you are increasing image magnification. If you think you are going to crop out a head from a crowd and it will be a fantastically beautiful headshot because you have more pixels you are dreaming. You really do need to get the image size &#8220;about&#8221; right on the film/sensor/etc. if you do not want it to fall apart. Hence - If you want to occasionally make really big images that look great you may find it easier and cheaper to grab some of the fantastic medium format film gear that is out there.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. EVERYTHING at 40x microscope magnification looks like crap, all movement and vibration starts to show up, unless you focused at 40x magnification your focus looks like crap, EVERYTHING looks like it sucks. When will you make output that is 20x magnification designed for close viewing? NEVER - if you have to you are using the wrong device to capture your images, get something bigger and go for lower magnification for the same target output size.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2009_003_05.jpg"><img title="2009_003_05.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2009_003_05.jpg" border="0" alt="2009_003_05.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="left" /></a>A quick update on my commitment to shoot film with my M6 prior to springing for an M9. Well, I finally got the kinks worked out of my development process and tools, so I am ready to go. Remember the first two rolls I sent through? Almost decade old TMZ and TRI-X? I found the answer of what was going wrong - it wasn&#8217;t me. The tank I was using had developed a crack that was invisible for the most part but not invisible to the film. I did the latest roll with a larger different tank and no more giant fog and &#8220;opened the camera back&#8221; look.</p>

<p>I did order a replacement small batch tank and a bunch of fresh film. I ordered some fresh stuff in both medium format and 35mm. I figured if I am going to fire up the wet process there was no reason to just shoot with the M series. I will give my medium format film stuff some exercise as well. This is actually fun. The images included with the post are two frames from the beginning of that last roll that didn&#8217;t have any obvious faults. Again 7 or 8 year old TRI-X that I had never processed. There are actually a bunch of frames that have some potential. I wonder why I chucked this roll to the side way back when? Most likely I got busy with commercial stuff and didn&#8217;t have a slot for the the film type/developer for it and forgot about it.</p>

<p>For anybody that is remotely curious the developer that I have been using is Pyrocat HD in<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2009_003_03.jpg"><img title="2009_003_03.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2009_003_03.jpg" border="0" alt="2009_003_03.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="right" /></a> glycol. I have a bit of experience with it in the past and now that it comes premixed in glycol it should keep extremely well - the glycol doesn&#8217;t do anything but preserve the stock solutions better than water but that is important if I am not going to be doing high volume work. The liquid kit cost about $30 and makes 50 liters of working solution. For my uses that is about 100 rolls of film. I could probably double that if I change my process a bit but 500 ml is about the practical limit for a single roll of film in my setup. So I guess the price is about 30Â¢ a roll - not too extravagant.</p>

<p>The fresh films that I ordered are Kodak TRI-X 400 (TX), TRI-X 320 (TXP), TMAX 100 (TMX), TMAX 400 (TMY), and Efke R100. For the uninitiated, the TX and TXP are completely different films - both wonderful - but Kodak should have probably named them something completely different. The only thing they have in common is spectral response. The TMX is one of my go to films, the TMY is the new version that I have never tried so I am going to calibrate it and see what I think - just in case TRI-X goes away or maybe I will be surprised and find that I love it for some reason. The R100 is to see if this is actually the same really old style stuff that gives me results like Veripan - I tried some of it a long time ago and it had a really nice scale so we will see.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2001_019_05.jpg"><img title="2001_019_05.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2001_019_05.jpg" border="0" alt="2001_019_05.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" align="left" /></a>Just another in my series of shooting real film. This time Ilford PanF Plus, developed in PMK pyro. I was playing with this for a little while to see if it could do duty as my slow, sharp, fine grained film. The brief answer is no. At the time and still to this day I think Kodak TMAX 100 blows it out of the water in every way, including aesthetics. PanF does nothing for better than TMAX (or Delta 100 for that matter) and a whole lot of things way worse.</p>

<p>Here is the brief rundown. Yes it is sharp and fine grained but it has so many faults with no redeeming factors. It is really slow, so slow in the shadows that it is more like using Agfa APX 25 or Kodak Panatomic X. In fact I would prefer either of those to the Pan F. Combine this characteristic with the fact that it shoulders off so fast in the highlights it is more like using an ortho film or Tech Pan and it really sucks. To explain this in english not only is it not 50 speed when trying to retain shadow detail in zone III it blocks up very easily either via exposure or development. When I say it blocks up I really mean that, it doesn&#8217;t just get denser and denser like TMAX does while retaining detail, it goes to maximum density really quick and that is all she wrote - no more detail - no more differentiation. Done, blown. TMAX 100 on the other hand will get really dense but continues to add more and more density so the detail is there even if it is hard for newbies to get detail in the highlights. Completely different.<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/panf100.jpg"><img title="panf100.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.panf100.jpg" border="0" alt="panf100.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="118" height="150" align="right" /></a></p>

<p>Honestly I have no idea why Ilford continues to make this stuff (I think they do). I have no idea why they made it in the 90&#8217;s when I tested it. For that matter I have no idea why Agfa and Kodak couldn&#8217;t make money with their slow films like APX 25 and Panatomic X verses this crap. At least those two had redeeming qualities. Yes I know that all really slow films act like I describe more than faster films but having a lot of experience with Panatomic X and APX 25 and the supposedly evil but actually fantastic TMAX I can say that Pan F was ridiculous and virtually useless even after taking the time to calibrate it. I would never use it for plus development - useless.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/badtx.jpg"><img title="badtx.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.badtx.jpg" border="0" alt="badtx.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="107" align="left" /></a>Just had to let you people know - did a second roll of ancient unprocessed film today. It is still drying. If there is anything remotely reproducible/scannable I will post it in an update. This time around it was 8 year old TRI-X. Fog, and guess what edge burning and general look as though I opened the camera with the film still loaded. This time it is worse.</p>

<p>Could it be that this is the reason that this particular roll went unprocessed? Maybe but I am thinking that the tank that I am using has a light leak because the exposure pattern is the same as that roll of TMZ. After studying the edge burn pattern the evidence is inconclusive but I am changing tanks for the the next run. Â Am I deterred? Nope - I have plenty of really old unprocessed film laying around to make sure my process is back up and running correctly. That and I am curious to see what the heck was on this film that I decided not to<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/badtx100.jpg"><img title="badtx100.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.badtx100.jpg" border="0" alt="badtx100.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="107" align="right" /></a> process it at the time.</p>

<p>I really doubt I pulled the dumb-ass mistake of opening the camera back more than once with film still loaded. It is possible but I think that I would remember that. Stay tuned.</p>

I really haven&#8217;t shot film in the last two years since my last move. Well I did shoot some medium format but that was color and was not my M series Leica. In preparation to start shooting seriously with the M series I ordered up a fresh batch of developer and fixer from Photographers Forumulary and it arrived today.</p>

<p>To warm up the old darkroom skills I figured that I would round up a bunch of old unprocessed film that I seem to have accumulated. Don&#8217;t ask - there are a million reasons that I have unprocessed rolls of film laying around. I started with one that I knew would be a bear. TMZ shot at 1600 in 2002 - at least that is when I wrote the date on it. The results were absolutely horrible, probably the worst thing that has ever come out of the tank. That includes worse than my very first roll of film developed when I was like 13 years old in the parents basement. I did figure out why this roll was not ever processed, which at least satisfies my curiosity.</p>

<p>The reason that this particular roll was not processed was that it is fairly obvious that I opened the camera while there was still film in the camera - ooooops. I am sentimental, I kept it so that I could process it when I wasn&#8217;t so backed up with &#8220;real&#8221; photographic work just to see. Well that was seven years after. The list of issues goes on from there. Â The fog is so bad that you can&#8217;t even see through the film - it is now &#8220;frosted&#8217; instead of transparent.<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/badtmz.jpg"><img title="badtmz.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.badtmz.jpg" border="0" alt="badtmz.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="147" align="right" /></a> It has grain that nobody could love - either that or the coating has reticulation from some abuse over the last 7 years that I forgot about it or I screwed the pooch with temp control and shocked it into reticulation. In any case I am not at all deterred. Well I am a little deterred, namely I am not going to shoot any of the expired TMZ that I have - that is headed for posterity labeled &#8220;DO NOT SHOOT - IT WILL LOOK HORRIBLE&#8221;.</p>

<p>I will keep you up to date on the M series quest - I am going to shoot the M at least as much as I shoot digital for the rest of the year to make sure that I really really want a digital M.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/sc1.jpg"><img title="sc1.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.sc1.jpg" border="0" alt="sc1.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="146" height="150" align="left" /></a>This image is about 6&#8221; wide. It was shot on 120 medium format film. That&#8217;s a magnification factor of 2.7 give or take. It&#8217;s fantastically detailed and reasonably sharp. It looks even better on paper because on paper it will be 3 to 6 times the resolution that you can see on your monitor at 100 dpi or so. So how many megapixels is that? It really doesn&#8217;t matter as long as you can get about 250 - 300 dpi on paper. Your magnification may be greater because you probably have a sensor that is DX or FX sized (Nikon speak for APS-C and Full frame 35mm) so your magnification would be like a factor of 6 shooting full frame 35mm.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s all that mean. Well it means if most of the stuff you ever print or display is about 6&#8221; up and down you are great with about 2.5 megapixels - seriously. Oh but I want to display it on my HD TV okay - you need about hmm, 2.5 megapixels for that you can do that math to show you how big a really good print you can get is. What do you get with more megapixels? You get the ability to make bigger prints, that&#8217;s it. At the same time you do get to look at how lousy your technique is, how bad your lens is, and clog up your harddrive faster. What happens when you look at a 12 megapixel image at 100% in your favorite software assuming it was taken on a full frame or 35mm device? Well you get to simulate what a 30&#8221;x45&#8221; print looks like at about a foot away - more importantly you are looking at your image at a factor of 30 magnification. Let&#8217;s go for the gold and do the same thing shot on a 25 megapixel D3x for $8000. Now we are looking at a print about 40&#8221;x60&#8221; print at 40x magnification.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s see how my crappy old film image holds up looking at a 40&#8221; print. Wow! amazing - that is like a giant print I will lay down money that it fares better than the D3x at the same print sizes. Why you ask? The answer is that magnification factor that I keep mentioning. <a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/sc2.jpg"><img title="sc2.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.sc2.jpg" border="0" alt="sc2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="146" height="150" align="right" /></a>You see 25 megapixels at 100% on an FX sensor is 40x, about the same as the microscope shots that they used to put in all the photo magazines to test lenses and films and such. That magnification factor is pretty important when revealing lens flaws, technique flaws, etc. My crappy old medium format negative at 40x would be like 8 feet wide a whole lot bigger before those same technique and lens flaws started showing up.</p>

<p>Here is my money saving tip for those with gear lust - before you upgrade megapixels (assuming you have something that is already enough) ask yourself what the purpose is? Are you going to make giant prints? If so by all means upgrade but also realize that you really really have to upgrade your technique by a large factor when you get more pixels - maybe your lenses to. If you are not really focusing very critically forget lenses. If you are handholding your shots at anything but stratospheric shutter speeds, forget lenses. I am telling you from decades of practical experience here that to up the quality of your game it takes a lot of effort and time on your part. If you have any hope of seeing bigger and better prints in terms of quality you really need to completely change the things that have to do with the way you focus, expose, and shoot prior to upping your magnification (megapixels). You may actually be far better off with less magnification.</p>

<p>If you do want to make the occasional really fantastic large print look into film, even medium format film. Use it when you really want to concentrate on making photographs. The kind of kit that you can pickup now in 6x6 or 6x4.5 for chump change is absolutely mind numbing. Hasselblad/Zeiss for $1500 that looks like it was never used with the latest (or next to it) CF/CFi lenses. Bronica ETRsi for those that like to hand hold full kits with a couple of backs and a lens or two - $500. I have even seen some Hasselblad H1 film kits with backs, prism, body, and a lens go for $2000. I promise you that this stuff will blow the crap out of a 25 megapixel full frame 35mm body. Don&#8217;t like the grain/noise - well that&#8217;s fine considering you can only see it in a 40&#8221; print like shown here and that is 400 speed black and white old tech film. If you are looking to up the ante in your print size/quality it is a far less costly and more productive route - and actually a little easier than going with more megapixels at higher magnifications. You will have to shoot a heck of a lot of film to make up the cost.</p>

<p>The two brands that I mentioned I can vouch for personally in terms of consistent quality, esp the Hasselblad and Zeiss CFi stuff. Just something to think about. The really funny thing is that this particular negative is just a casual working shot that I happen to be printing out for a book concept that I am working on, not like a demo quality negative. It was shot at 1/8 second without mirror lockup on a 503/CW - translation = bad news if you really want critical sharpness and detail.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/IDPDFblurb.jpg"><img title="IDPDFblurb.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.IDPDFblurb.jpg" border="0" alt="IDPDFblurb.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="134" align="left" /></a>Been doing a lot of correspondence lately with some poor souls that are lost in the evil wilderness between color management hocus-pocus, the bizarre alternate reality that is Aperture printing behavior, and Blurb.com. I hope that I didn&#8217;t come off sounding dismissive of good color management practices or someone that thinks sRGB is the end all be all. I am not and have been dealing with end to end color management since the dark ages when it was &#8220;hard&#8221;.</p>

<p>Most of the time color management should be easy nowadays as I explain in <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2008/04/16/color-management-and-other-stupid-internet-tricks/">this rant from a while ago</a>.Â Let me try to set a couple of things strait and convey some useful info as well. I will start out by saying that Aperture printing is hopelessly broken in a lot of cases. I say this because a lot of readers are Aperture users. I personally think that it is shameful that Apple&#8217;s &#8220;pro&#8221; image application is so prone to producing really bad prints through no fault of the users. The big issue here is that quite a substantial number of Aperture users follow what are perfectly reasonable color management paths then go to make a print from Aperture and it is horrible. After trying 72 different random settings with no real improvement except in the rare case that 42 wrongs add up to make a right, they turn to the web for answers.</p>

<p>On the quest for answers they pickup all kinds of voodoo mixed in with fantastically detailed and idiotically low level technical information (mostly related to CMYK 4 color processes) from the probably brilliant but obtuse likes of Heinrick Heimlichk over on the apple board and such. They end up with a hopelessly confused color paranoia at then end of it when the real answer is A - Aperture printing is broken and B - there is not a lot of practical &#8220;how to&#8221; information out there.</p>

<p>In cases where Aperture is producing a print that is obviously wrong and you are sure you did everything right (I will spare you the details they are all over the place on choosing the correct paper/printer profile) here is what I have done with limited success to &#8220;fix&#8221; it.</p>

<p>1) Trash the Aperture printing preferences.</p>

<p>2) Go download the absolutely latest driver for your printer from the manufacturer (this matters a lot)</p>

<p>3) Reinstall the printer driver.</p>

<p>4) Try it again making sure all of the settings in Aperture print dialog and the OS dialog match and make sense.</p>

<p>If this doesn&#8217;t work you are probably out of luck printing from Aperture and using &#8220;good&#8221; color management practices until either Apple or the printer manufacturer releases updates that happen to fix your issue - these are rarely labeled with &#8220;fixes Aperture print issue&#8221; tags. Trust me on this a driver from Canon that was released in early 2009 did produced really bad results with Aperture (only Aperture) and the same exact driver released in June worked fine with no mention of anything remotely related as changes or fixes.</p>

<p>Okay, moving on to dealing with color management, profiles, etc no matter what your preferred software is. There are a couple of practical tips that I want to address here some of which are technically not &#8220;correct&#8221; and if you are someone that has been dealing with color management and conversion for years in the commercial world I am sure you will argue the special cases with me - please don&#8217;t. If you are a photographer that wants to get good prints and are having some issues or just want to make them a little better - this may be for you.</p>

<p>There are two different cases of profile conversions that you need to concern yourself with. The first one is converting an image file from one color space/profile to another in order to meet some other outside parties specifications and ensure that you are doing the conversion that you want and NOT using the other parties default conversion settings. This is important, really important if you care about color and controlling how your images look. I cannot stress enough how important this is even if the third party is &#8220;color managed&#8221;. Here is why - Let&#8217;s say you have an image that is in Adobe RGB color space and you &#8220;soft proof&#8221; it on your calibrated screen. Fantastic and things will most like likely turn out okay if you send your images and it&#8217;s profile to this outside provider/partner/whatever that will ultimately be converted into the color space for whatever the intent is (printing, projection, web, etc). This is probably what 99% of the world does and is generally okay but it is not at all okay if you really want to control and understand the results. Here is why - the proof and conversion settings maybe wildly different even if the profiles are exactly the same and that difference can be anything from about the same to catastrophically different. The two main conversion settings that are likely to vary are the &#8220;black point compensation&#8221; and the &#8220;rendering intent&#8221;. If you do not think these matter a lot switch them back and forth/on and off while looking at a soft proof - still not convinced - make two prints with opposite settings.</p>

<p>Even if your settings are the same things can still go wrong because &#8220;black point compensation&#8221; is not a standard it is an algorithm that may vary from color conversion engine to color conversion engine. Same thing with the rendering intent &#8220;perceptual&#8221; - not a standard. The bottom line is if you care you will do the conversion yourself so no conversion happens on the other side.</p>

<p>The second and very closely related color space conversions that you will be doing are the conversion to make a print on your own printer in the print settings dialog. Here is a clue - use the same settings to print that you used to soft proof on your screen. In Aperture this is an issue because you can choose the profile but you cannot choose the rendering intent or black point compensation. Same deal with printing in Aperture except you get to choose black point compensation this time. Another reason Aperture printing is hopelessly broken and unacceptable at this state of the game. For those of you wondering - as far as I know the rendering intent in Aperture is &#8220;relative colormetric&#8221; - not a bad thing actually.</p>

<p>So what settings should you use for converting files and/or printing - the good news is that they are usually relative colormetric and black point compensation turned on. The better news is in 99.9% of all cases these are the &#8220;best&#8221; settings for photographs in both printing and file conversion situations. The only other setting that you may want to use for photographs is &#8220;perceptual&#8221;, the reason you may want to use this is if significant areas - especially if they are adjacent to each other - are out of the target color gamut. In other words the color space that you are converting to cannot reproduce the colors in your image. How do you know if they are out of gamut - you need software that shows you like Photoshop. As far as I can tell Aperture has no way of showing you what colors are out of gamut in a target colorspace. Not good.</p>

<p>I guess that brings us to why I recommended Aperture users just sending sRGB to blurb.com - Well to make it easy. Most of your images - if they are like my images will not have a significant gamut issues in the conversion from Adobe 1998 to sRGB and you can actually see what that conversion will look like without anything special just by looking at them on your computer vs. sending them a wider gamut profile like Adobe RGB and having no idea what the conversion at blub will look like. Reason two is there is no way to do the conversion to the HP Indigo CMYK profile from within Aperture. Sure you can look at it using Apertures fixed soft proof settings - by all means do that but you cannot do the conversion within Aperture. Three blurb.com has tons of experience and satisfied customers that send them sRGB and the conversion settings they use are about as good as you are going to get, there is no reason to send them wider gamut RGB files as all of them go sRGB first (they say so) - you just don&#8217;t get to see them first.</p>

<p>For those of you wishing a finer degree of control over the output the recipe is Photoshop to view gamut warnings, Photoshop to soft proof the conversions and parameters, Photoshop for the conversions and parameters. Then InDesign for the layout. Sure you can do all the Photoshop conversions but why the hell would you want to import CMYK PSD&#8217;s back into Aperture trust me it will import them but Aperture wreaks havoc on them when you try to export them with the source profile. I don&#8217;t even want to try to figure out what the hell isgoing on here it would be an intellectual exercise that leads nowhere with a bunch of model and space conversion going on just to use the Aperture book tool pretty much canceling out all of that fine degree of control you were after in the first place. <a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/ApCMYK.jpg"><img title="ApCMYK.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.ApCMYK.jpg" border="0" alt="ApCMYK.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="95" height="150" align="right" /></a>The attached image is what happens to a when you try to export a TIFF from aperture using a CMYK PSD and a CMYK profile - I cannot even begin to explain what the hell Aperture is doing nor why they would allow you to import it in the first place considering ALL CMYK COLOR MODELS ARE DEVICE DEPENDENT. The funny thing is that it does work to export to an RGB color profile - how useless is that for managing your color very precisely at the source?</p>

<p>I hope that this helps some of you out with both Blurb.com, deciding on a tool set to use for your book project, and Aperture printing. One final word of advise if you are choosing InDesign for your blurb.com layout tool and are processing your final images in Photoshop and using the CMYK profile blurb.com provides: The default color settings in InDesign will not work - you much change them to use attached CMYK profiles versus retain CMYK numbers.</p>

Not really my taste in the specific treatment of the negatives (this was done on film) but the images are great and as I said a fantastic example. If this is the kind of thing (range and proximity) of things you like to shoot. The M9 or M6 or M3 may be the camera for you. If you are too lazy to process and scan film then definitely the M9. This image is not from the book it is one of my old ones. M6 50 Summicron, Â TMAX 400.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I cannot believe that this subject is so popular. I also cannot believe that so many people are so paranoid of an sRGB output. I guess I am glad to see a lot of interest in printing and I think both Apple books and Blurb.com are a fantastic way to showcase your work - far better than just jamming them up on the web.</p>

<p>Let me get to the point - I have made blurb books from Aperture and I am pretty certain based on my experience with a lot of digital and traditional printing that there will be no difference with an sRGB output vs a CMYK output. A reader asked if I had hard evidence. The answer to that is no but I would be willing to shed a couple of bucks if there really are a bunch of people interested in hard evidence between an Aperture sRGB/Booksmart sRGB workflow and a full-blown Adobe InDesign CMYK workflow using the blurb.com supplied CMYK/HP Indigo profile.</p>

<p>I happen to be handy with both and since I am planning a new book about my local neighborhood area sooner or later I will be happy to conduct a head to head comparison if there are people that would benefit from this.</p>

<p>Here is the deal - leave a comment on this post if you want to see a head to head comparison. If there are more than 10 people interested I will spend the time and money to do a cage match of sorts. Do me a favor and let me know what books/subject matter you are planning with what type of medium as well so I can try to cover the bases in terms of workflow/color management/image types and associated colors.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A long long time ago I put up a couple of posts about a couple of ways to use Aperture&#8217;s easy to use but completely undocumented book layout tool for just about any book printing service. I guess all of a sudden these services have become far more popular and hence I have receive a bunch of questions specifically related to blurb.com and Aperture. Instead of trying to recap all of the information exchanged I am just going to give a couple of guidelines to help point people interested in this the right way.</p>

<p>Just to summarize, there are two general approaches to dealing with other 3rd party print services using Aperture. The first and really simple way is to using one of the PDF to image options in the book printing menu and then place those images of the actual pages using the services layout facilities such as Blurb&#8217;s BookSmart. For a while this was the only way to do it with blurb.com. The other way was to print to a PDF of the correct specifications for the book service. So one - print from Aperture ending up with JPG or TIFF images of the pages or two - print from Aperture ending up with a PDF.</p>

<p>In both of these cases I suggested using a custom automator workflow added to the PDF services with Aperture so that you could control the specs. These are easy enough to create by copying the ones already there and modifying them with the Automator tool. The whats, wheres, and hows are detailed in one of the other posts in this series. Here are a couple of considerations when doing this.</p>

<p>First off both approaches need a custom book theme - unless you do not want precise layout within the services formats you need to be using a custom them with the correct page and margin dimensions. In most cases this means existing books using built-in Aperture book themes will not work. This is not always the case. Some books have a bunch of white space around all of the page edges and would be fine cropped somewhat. Get the page and margin dimensions from blurb or other service. One other thing you probably want to do for either approach is to set up the printer in the Aperture book printing dialog for borderless printing.</p>

<p>The next thing that you need to pay attention to is the specifications of the files you are sending. That is why I recommended the customized automator PDF workflows for either images or PDFs. The first thing is the color model and color profile. As of right now you will be much better making sure your images whether PDF or PDF to TIFF/JPG are sRGB. This is not the case for the default workflows included with Mac OS X and Aperture. For instance using the built-in PDF-X workflow the embedded image files will be Adobe RGB. Don&#8217;t believe me? Check them out for yourself. Don&#8217;t know how to check them ? - definitely use sRGB.</p>

<p>Here is why for all of you color management pro wanna-be&#8217;s out there. Let&#8217;s take blurb.com. Their entire production workflow and hardware is optimized for sRGB. Just look at the little color space diagram they give you in their help section. Blurb goes on to tell you that if you are sending RGB image files to send them sRGB, not Adobe RGB or ProPhoto, or, etc, etc. After that they state that if you really really really want to send them something else to make yourself feel better send them a very specific CMYK profile for the HP equipment they use. That means you need images in the CMYK color MODEL and then convert them to the CMYK profile that they supply. First off if you are using Aperture you not only don&#8217;t have CMYK images you can&#8217;t have them - Aperture does not do this. Second there is NO reason you would want to with the minor exception of already having an InDesign document and images already in CMYK that you already use to deal with real process color printing presses. That is the only reason in which case you have no reason to be trying to do this from Aperture.</p>

<p>Why am I so viciously adamant on this? Because I want to leave no room for misinterpretation that people working in Aperture or Photoshop or anything else for that matter that are not dealing with CMYK printing presses have no need to deal with CMYK color models. That and I want to leave no room for misinterpretation that your output from blurb.com will be NO BETTER going through creating and probably screwing up your images/files to CMYK. Stop worrying.</p>
