  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/2000_031_10.jpg"><img title="2000_031_10.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/.thumbs/.2000_031_10.jpg" border="0" alt="2000_031_10.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="left" /></a>Just wanted to let everyone know what is going in my world. After a couple of days the latest Aperture update is proving to be much more stable. I have not had it crash once since the update - your milage will vary. Hooray for Apple.</p>

<p>The screencasts have gone well so far - I have received a lot of valuable feedback and very much appreciate those that have taken the time. I will take the suggestions to heart and try my best to incorporate them. Thank goodness that people have found them helpful in various ways. I have my list of topics that I am guessing people would like - if you have suggestions feel free to drop a comment or an email with your priorities I am always interested.</p>

<p>As many of you know I am an avid film shooter - not for nostalgia&#8217;s sake (well maybe a little) but because I think it is superior in some situations. Of course I shoot digital as well and it has it&#8217;s merits as well. I love that we have both - if you have not shot film in a while or even ever don&#8217;t short change yourself - try some. On that note - a photographer buddy of mine that went pure digital about 5 or 6 years ago is considering shooting film again, not exclusively but along side his digital. Of course I played a part in the subliminal suggestions that he might want to try it.</p>

<p>He is a color guy so no B+W - he is a fairly big time travel photographer that does a lot of landscape work and when he does he treats it very seriously - no need for speed or high ISO. You know the whole nine yards - tripod - ND grad filters, TS lens - the whole bit. The issue is he has a new market for his work - big giant prints - really big. His current kit is 12 MP cameras and we are having a little trouble producing the detail that he wants in his 3 to 4 foot wide prints - yea they look good because everything else is spot on - focus - no camera movement - color - exposure - etc. The important things but&#8230; 12MP even with a lot of tricks falls apart in terms of rendering fine detail. So we are both going to go out and shoot next weekend - his gear and he is going to shoot Velvia 50 in my old FM2 (hooks to his stuff) side by side to see what he likes better for the big enlargements of landscape with high detail - of course the film will get scanned and be output digitally. His conundrum - he does not want to plunk down $8000 plus a spare for the D3x right now and is not even sure if that will cut it - it is a small part of his business (the big prints) and I agree - this is bad timing for $16K on D3X gear. He does not want to go MF digital for two reasons - cost and it is too heavy.</p>

<p>I may bring my large format camera and two lenses with me to shoot 4x5 Velvia - we&#8217;ll see. I have this mentality that if you are going to futz around for 10 minutes with tripods - tilt shift - grad filters for one exposure you may as well shoot sheet film and be done with it - forget the small crap. A decent 4x5 field camera and two decent (spectacular) schneider&#8217;s or rodenstock&#8217;s are dirt cheap compared to MF digital or a one D3X and I will bet you that kit is lighter - he already has a giant carbon fiber tripod and all that crap. I will let you know where he goes with this and how the 35mm experiment turns out.</p>

<p>That brings me to prints - I have been dabbling with my mentioned friend in custom large print services - If getting big prints on good paper from a big Epson at a reasonable cost is something that you are interested in let me know. I may be doing this for a few people shortly.</p>

<p>Speaking of prints - my least popular product - the sample black and white prints (real ones) are selling about 10 copies a month - plenty for me to keep doing and not too much for it to be burdensome based on my current darkroom schedule. Even though they are not that popular to the general web crowd - they are well received by the couple of nutty people that want stuff like this. Number one request - more samples on different materials and larger variety of negative choices. Funny - I did not predict that.</p>

<p>If you have any strange stuff you would like to see in terms of B+W products let me know what specifically you might be interested in seeing - if it makes any sense in terms of time and cost I will probably be willing to produce it.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps - Answer to a few questions about large &#8220;art&#8221; prints that I have received: I do not sell these on-line - I cannot see selling a large expensive to produce and expensive to purchase print sight unseen. If you end up not liking it when you get it - I will feel bad and probably loose money. I do not want people to buy something from me that they do not like. So&#8230; at least for now I will sell hand made B+W final prints the way they should be viewed and acquired - in person.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay - so here is something that might surprise you. I am actually using Faces - not to the extent that <a href="http://bergsmavisuals.com/blog/apple-aperture/organization/the-cases-for-faces-in-aperture-3/">Matthew Bergsma</a> is - check him out but I am using it none the less. I still thing Apple has a lot of work to do with the UI but here are my suggestions on some of the ways to use Faces most effectively.</p>

<p>I did this screencast the same day that I did stacks and albums - I decided to release it a little later because I wanted to get some feedback on the first one before putting this out there. I took some suggestions from that you had from the couple that I put up on Places and books and color and incorporated them into stacks and albums. Namely - go slower - use menus instead of shortcuts - etc. My biggest worry was that I was going too slow - heck this one is 20 minutes on Faces but the feedback that I have gotten so far has been positive so here is the Faces screencast.</p>

<p>By all means keep the feedback and suggestions coming - I want to make these as useful as possible. <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/aperture-3-screencasts/">You can get the screencasts here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just wanted to share an observation that I had with my own Aperture library regarding Faces. I have installed the latest greatest 3.0.2 update and while it fixes a lot of things and appears to be much more stable - even with my limited 5 or 6 hours of use - the one thing it does not seem to help with is the &#8220;missing&#8221; face issue.</p>

<p>Like a lot of you out there some of the face extracts from my photos are blank. When I look at the full view of that photo it is fine and the face box is perfect - I have even tried deleting the &#8220;face box&#8221; and redrawing / renaming it to no avail. Getting to my observation, which is by no means comprehensive or scientific, I can say that in my library every single solitary photo that has this issue is a JPG - not only are the trouble causing images JPGs they are all associated with RAW+JPG &#8220;dual masters&#8221; as I do not have any stand-alone JPGs in my library.</p>

<p>When I have time I will try a more scientific set of experiments to see if I can find the root root root issue but it is very strange that this factor seems to hold true for my entire library.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you haven&#8217;t checked your updates today - you might want to. I told you these things would be coming out fast and furious now that the Aperture team is not so busy with the writing Aperture 3 in the first place. We&#8217;ll have to see what this fixes but I will bet you it is more than the description tells us - like usual.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. What this thing lists is fantastic - upgrade and import of old libraries, the folder hierarchy import issues - faces fixes - wow yea - print presets - finally import of color labels from XMP - yes yes (I was wondering when metadata was going to become useful in multi-app work-flows -more IPTC fixes - yes (look for an upcoming article on this and work-flow if it acutally works the way it should.)  Probably a bunch of stability/crash funkiness fixes too.</p>

Never heard of him - check out his photos of rock legends. In my book his images are what photography is all about - fantastic stuff. Heck he is a rock legend himself.</p>

<p>His photos are fantastic journalistic work - you know the kind that transcends just the recording and go into &#8220;art&#8221;. Truly something to aspire to as a photographer. I am sure that you have seen at least a dozen Jim Marshall images even if you have never heard of him before. Definitely a photographer worth studying.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. Jim was a Leica shooter - allegedly the image at the top was his M4. I had this laying around in my files - forget where I picked it up on the net.</p>

The good was that a viewer learned something that was not even on the topic of stacks and albums. The bad was that I should buy a better microphone. I will - I promise but first let&#8217;s see if these things prove to be helpful.</p>

<p>I just wanted to share a tidbit from the first screencast that someone found very helpful. Now that I think of it I do see the question of how to apply adjustments to multiple images simultaneously come up on the Apple support forums a lot. I want to generalize adjustments to mean metadata - image adjustments - keywords - whatever.</p>

<p>Most people conclude that the &#8220;primary only&#8221; button is somehow broken in Aperture because adjustments or changes they apply only affect the primary in any group of selected images. Well it&#8217;s not. There is a pretty simple rule to remember about how Aperture treats any modifications that you make to a group of images. Here it is:</p>

<p>If you use any of the inspectors to change the image - the metadata inspector, the adjustment inspector - in either the sidebar or the HUD those changes will only be applied to the primary - not the entire selection. If you use pretty much anything else like the menus, shortcut keys, or dragging a keyword from the keyword HUD to a group of selected images the changes will be applied to all the images unless the primary only button is active. Try it.</p>

<p>Of course you can always use lift and stamp as well. <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2009/02/08/aperture-quick-tip-lift-and-stamp/">Here is a dissertation on the ups and downs of lift and stamp</a> (forgive the pun)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have probably written more on Apple Aperture&#8217;s stacks and albums than on any other topic. I use stacks and albums for just about everything in terms of organizing my images and streamlining my work-flow. What surprised me is that some of the people that have read the posts here on stacks and albums still were having a tough time understanding how stacks and albums work together.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/aperture-3-screencasts/">Here is the first in a series of Screencasts on Aperture 3</a> that will be short - cheap - and hopefully very helpful. I have decided that instead of doing one big giant video that is like nine hours long I would instead tackle various aspects of Aperture 3 in small doses that are easy to understand and not too too long. This one is about 15 minutes.</p>

<p>As a charter customer of my screencasts you will get the exclusive right to complain at me for everything I did wrong or not good enough and I will listen. As an added bonus the customers for the first screencast will get any revisions I make to that one based on their feedback free. If you act now and I end up completely redoing it I will also give you the next screencast absolutely free as well.</p>

<p>Does that sound enough like a late night television commercial?</p>

<p>All kidding aside - I really am interested in hearing the good bad and ugly - I do want to make these things as helpful as I can.</p>

I am not at all interested in an M8. Well before I plopped down my hard earned money I decided to shoot for a while with my old film Leica&#8217;s instead - just to see if I really could justify an M9 purchase.</p>

<p>Guess what - not only have I decided that I do not want an M9 - at least not a $10,000 M9 but I am actually shooting more 35mm film than I am digital for like the last 4 months. Yes I still shoot digital to but I am shooting my M6 cameras more than my digital. I really love these cameras and I really like the way the film looks as well. So for now I am sticking with my film gear in terms of shooting rangefinders.</p>

<p>Based on my advanced rationalization skills acquired through a lot of practice I have determined that I can buy anything I want since I &#8220;saved&#8221; $10,000 by NOT buying an M9.What I have decided I need is a super-wide for my M cameras. I don&#8217;t want anything super outrageous like a 15mm - I have a 14mm for my Nikon film and digital bodies that is just fine and a bit too wide for &#8220;general purpose&#8221;. I want a 21mm.</p>

<p>My choices are either a Leica ASPH new - NOT the 1.4 and NOT crappy new budget one - the real one. A brand new Zeiss - again NOT the 1.4 but the small one or&#8230; The Voightlander. I have pretty much settled on the Voightlander - it is downright cheap and astoundingly good compared to SLR wide angles but I keep trying to get over the fact that I have only ever used Leica glass on my Leica cameras - I keep having visions of my self HATING every image that the thing pumps out but continuing to use it because it is good enough. I know that this is stupid - but somehow I am having trouble pulling the trigger on the Voghtlander.</p>

<p>Anyone out there have one of these things that can tell me to just go ahead and get the freaking thing already and just be done with it?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/DSC_9551.jpg"><img title="DSC_9551.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/.thumbs/.DSC_9551.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_9551.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="left" /></a>No Aperture 3 has not been abusing me - It has been the other way around. I do have to say it was a bit of a rocky first month but most of the catastrophic issues have been resolved. Yes there are some annoying bugs but nothing that is a show stopper for me. I am confident that even those annoyances will be resolved soon. The bottom line is that I am working faster than ever in Aperture 3 and that is good enough for me to declare it a win.</p>

<p>The big surprise is for me is that my initial impression of Faces was totally wrong. Once I figured out how to use it effectively I can see how big of a time saver it will be for a lot of shooters - including me. Apple&#8217;s UI choices are a little suspect in some areas and make getting used to an effective Faces work-flow a little challenging but over all Faces it pretty amazing. So much so it is high on my list of Screencast topics.</p>

<p>I have most of my other photographer buddies/clients that use Aperture converted over at this point but it was a nightmare - I have to say the biggest disappointment for me has been how god awful and unstable the Aperture2 to Aperture3 conversion process has been for existing libraries. I won&#8217;t go into details but there are some challenges that can only be overcome by brute force with no rhyme or reason and seem to be centered on a couple of images that hang Aperture conversions up permanently. Very disappointing. Emotionally it would be more comforting if the offending images, once found, were something out of the ordinary - like a 7G Tiff or something - but they aren&#8217;t.</p>

<p>The new curves tool is amazing - especially now that you can add lots of them and brush them in. Yes - I still use photoshop but it is becoming even more specialized. I wish the brushes worked a little more like the PS brush tool but hey - it&#8217;s a little too early to start creating wish lists of things for the next version. Apeture&#8217;s 64-bit goodness even ingests my unreasonably large 4000DPI 16bit scans of medium format scans without even a hiccup. Is it blazingly fast working on a file over half a gig? Well that is relative  - it is compared to loading it into Photoshop. More importantly it deals with them without getting completely flakey like Ap2 did.</p>

<p>So - are all you Aperture 3 converters out there happy and settled in yet or are you still experiencing frustration? Either way would love to here your thoughts now that it has had some time to ripen.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Instax.jpg"><img title="Instax.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/.thumbs/.Instax.jpg" border="0" alt="Instax.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="94" height="150" align="left" /></a>This image is a scan from daughter No. 1&#8217;s new camera. The camera is dead simple. No focus control, guess exposure, as in inside, sort of cloudy, sort of not cloudy, and sunny. That is the extent of it. The picture pops out the top. It&#8217;s small but has a really interesting &#8220;look&#8221;. She loves this thing - the Fuji Instax Mini.</p>

<p>I have to say I do not think that it is a camera or medium for me but&#8230; it is a blast and a welcome retreat from complexity. I also have to say that it&#8217;s not just the lack of complexity - I actually like some of the images a whole lot. Like this one. Why? I don&#8217;t exactly know. I am going to leave this one up - I may even print it out (she has the original) and let is sit around for a week or a month so that I really think about why I like it so much.</p>

<p>Mind you I will probably not run out an buy an Instax, or an old polaroid and load it up with Fuji instant film for my next project but I am going to think really really hard about why I like this image so much and use some of those answers to guide me in my selection of media, materials, and image capture device for some project ideas I have rattling around in my head. I probably won&#8217;t buy any new stuff - I have far more than I &#8220;need&#8221; already. I will however probably change a couple of things up from what my usual repertoire or M.O. is.</p>

<p>I will let you know as soon as I digest my feelings for this and am able to articulate this more efffectively.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>
