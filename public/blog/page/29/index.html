  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just wanted to share an observation that I had with my own Aperture library regarding Faces. I have installed the latest greatest 3.0.2 update and while it fixes a lot of things and appears to be much more stable - even with my limited 5 or 6 hours of use - the one thing it does not seem to help with is the &#8220;missing&#8221; face issue.</p>

<p>Like a lot of you out there some of the face extracts from my photos are blank. When I look at the full view of that photo it is fine and the face box is perfect - I have even tried deleting the &#8220;face box&#8221; and redrawing / renaming it to no avail. Getting to my observation, which is by no means comprehensive or scientific, I can say that in my library every single solitary photo that has this issue is a JPG - not only are the trouble causing images JPGs they are all associated with RAW+JPG &#8220;dual masters&#8221; as I do not have any stand-alone JPGs in my library.</p>

<p>When I have time I will try a more scientific set of experiments to see if I can find the root root root issue but it is very strange that this factor seems to hold true for my entire library.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you haven&#8217;t checked your updates today - you might want to. I told you these things would be coming out fast and furious now that the Aperture team is not so busy with the writing Aperture 3 in the first place. We&#8217;ll have to see what this fixes but I will bet you it is more than the description tells us - like usual.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. What this thing lists is fantastic - upgrade and import of old libraries, the folder hierarchy import issues - faces fixes - wow yea - print presets - finally import of color labels from XMP - yes yes (I was wondering when metadata was going to become useful in multi-app work-flows -more IPTC fixes - yes (look for an upcoming article on this and work-flow if it acutally works the way it should.) Â Probably a bunch of stability/crash funkiness fixes too.</p>

Never heard of him - check out his photos of rock legends. In my book his images are what photography is all about - fantastic stuff. Heck he is a rock legend himself.</p>

<p>His photos are fantastic journalistic work - you know the kind that transcends just the recording and go into &#8220;art&#8221;. Truly something to aspire to as a photographer. I am sure that you have seen at least a dozen Jim Marshall images even if you have never heard of him before. Definitely a photographer worth studying.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. Jim was a Leica shooter - allegedly the image at the top was his M4. I had this laying around in my files - forget where I picked it up on the net.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/000000101.jpg"><img title="000000101.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/.thumbs/.000000101.jpg" border="0" alt="000000101.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="101" align="left" /></a>Got some feedback on the first screencast already - some good and some bad. The good was that a viewer learned something that was not even on the topic of stacks and albums. The bad was that I should buy a better microphone. I will - I promise but first let&#8217;s see if these things prove to be helpful.</p>

<p>I just wanted to share a tidbit from the first screencast that someone found very helpful. Now that I think of it I do see the question of how to apply adjustments to multiple images simultaneously come up on the Apple support forums a lot. I want to generalize adjustments to mean metadata - image adjustments - keywords - whatever.</p>

<p>Most people conclude that the &#8220;primary only&#8221; button is somehow broken in Aperture because adjustments or changes they apply only affect the primary in any group of selected images. Well it&#8217;s not. There is a pretty simple rule to remember about how Aperture treats any modifications that you make to a group of images. Here it is:</p>

<p>If you use any of the inspectors to change the image - the metadata inspector, the adjustment inspector - in either the sidebar or the HUD those changes will only be applied to the primary - not the entire selection. If you use pretty much anything else like the menus, shortcut keys, or dragging a keyword from the keyword HUD to a group of selected images the changes will be applied to all the images unless the primary only button is active. Try it.</p>

<p>Of course you can always use lift and stamp as well. <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2009/02/08/aperture-quick-tip-lift-and-stamp/">Here is a dissertation on the ups and downs of lift and stamp</a> (forgive the pun)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have probably written more on Apple Aperture&#8217;s stacks and albums than on any other topic. I use stacks and albums for just about everything in terms of organizing my images and streamlining my work-flow. What surprised me is that some of the people that have read the posts here on stacks and albums still were having a tough time understanding how stacks and albums work together.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/aperture-3-screencasts/">Here is the first in a series of Screencasts on Aperture 3</a> that will be short - cheap - and hopefully very helpful. I have decided that instead of doing one big giant video that is like nine hours long I would instead tackle various aspects of Aperture 3 in small doses that are easy to understand and not too too long. This one is about 15 minutes.</p>

<p>As a charter customer of my screencasts you will get the exclusive right to complain at me for everything I did wrong or not good enough and I will listen. As an added bonus the customers for the first screencast will get any revisions I make to that one based on their feedback free. If you act now and I end up completely redoing it I will also give you the next screencast absolutely free as well.</p>

<p>Does that sound enough like a late night television commercial?</p>

<p>All kidding aside - I really am interested in hearing the good bad and ugly - I do want to make these things as helpful as I can.</p>

I am not at all interested in an M8. Well before I plopped down my hard earned money I decided to shoot for a while with my old film Leica&#8217;s instead - just to see if I really could justify an M9 purchase.</p>

<p>Guess what - not only have I decided that I do not want an M9 - at least not a $10,000 M9 but I am actually shooting more 35mm film than I am digital for like the last 4 months. Yes I still shoot digital to but I am shooting my M6 cameras more than my digital. I really love these cameras and I really like the way the film looks as well. So for now I am sticking with my film gear in terms of shooting rangefinders.</p>

<p>Based on my advanced rationalization skills acquired through a lot of practice I have determined that I can buy anything I want since I &#8220;saved&#8221; $10,000 by NOT buying an M9.What I have decided I need is a super-wide for my M cameras. I don&#8217;t want anything super outrageous like a 15mm - I have a 14mm for my Nikon film and digital bodies that is just fine and a bit too wide for &#8220;general purpose&#8221;. I want a 21mm.</p>

<p>My choices are either a Leica ASPH new - NOT the 1.4 and NOT crappy new budget one - the real one. A brand new Zeiss - again NOT the 1.4 but the small one or&#8230; The Voightlander. I have pretty much settled on the Voightlander - it is downright cheap and astoundingly good compared to SLR wide angles but I keep trying to get over the fact that I have only ever used Leica glass on my Leica cameras - I keep having visions of my self HATING every image that the thing pumps out but continuing to use it because it is good enough. I know that this is stupid - but somehow I am having trouble pulling the trigger on the Voghtlander.</p>

<p>Anyone out there have one of these things that can tell me to just go ahead and get the freaking thing already and just be done with it?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/DSC_9551.jpg"><img title="DSC_9551.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/.thumbs/.DSC_9551.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_9551.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="left" /></a>No Aperture 3 has not been abusing me - It has been the other way around. I do have to say it was a bit of a rocky first month but most of the catastrophic issues have been resolved. Yes there are some annoying bugs but nothing that is a show stopper for me. I am confident that even those annoyances will be resolved soon. The bottom line is that I am working faster than ever in Aperture 3 and that is good enough for me to declare it a win.</p>

<p>The big surprise is for me is that my initial impression of Faces was totally wrong. Once I figured out how to use it effectively I can see how big of a time saver it will be for a lot of shooters - including me. Apple&#8217;s UI choices are a little suspect in some areas and make getting used to an effective Faces work-flow a little challenging but over all Faces it pretty amazing. So much so it is high on my list of Screencast topics.</p>

<p>I have most of my other photographer buddies/clients that use Aperture converted over at this point but it was a nightmare - I have to say the biggest disappointment for me has been how god awful and unstable the Aperture2 to Aperture3 conversion process has been for existing libraries. I won&#8217;t go into details but there are some challenges that can only be overcome by brute force with no rhyme or reason and seem to be centered on a couple of images that hang Aperture conversions up permanently. Very disappointing. Emotionally it would be more comforting if the offending images, once found, were something out of the ordinary - like a 7G Tiff or something - but they aren&#8217;t.</p>

<p>The new curves tool is amazing - especially now that you can add lots of them and brush them in. Yes - I still use photoshop but it is becoming even more specialized. I wish the brushes worked a little more like the PS brush tool but hey - it&#8217;s a little too early to start creating wish lists of things for the next version. Apeture&#8217;s 64-bit goodness even ingests my unreasonably large 4000DPI 16bit scans of medium format scans without even a hiccup. Is it blazingly fast working on a file over half a gig? Well that is relative Â - it is compared to loading it into Photoshop. More importantly it deals with them without getting completely flakey like Ap2 did.</p>

<p>So - are all you Aperture 3 converters out there happy and settled in yet or are you still experiencing frustration? Either way would love to here your thoughts now that it has had some time to ripen.</p>

The camera is dead simple. No focus control, guess exposure, as in inside, sort of cloudy, sort of not cloudy, and sunny. That is the extent of it. The picture pops out the top. It&#8217;s small but has a really interesting &#8220;look&#8221;. She loves this thing - the Fuji Instax Mini.</p>

<p>I have to say I do not think that it is a camera or medium for me but&#8230; it is a blast and a welcome retreat from complexity. I also have to say that it&#8217;s not just the lack of complexity - I actually like some of the images a whole lot. Like this one. Why? I don&#8217;t exactly know. I am going to leave this one up - I may even print it out (she has the original) and let is sit around for a week or a month so that I really think about why I like it so much.</p>

<p>Mind you I will probably not run out an buy an Instax, or an old polaroid and load it up with Fuji instant film for my next project but I am going to think really really hard about why I like this image so much and use some of those answers to guide me in my selection of media, materials, and image capture device for some project ideas I have rattling around in my head. I probably won&#8217;t buy any new stuff - I have far more than I &#8220;need&#8221; already. I will however probably change a couple of things up from what my usual repertoire or M.O. is.</p>

<p>I will let you know as soon as I digest my feelings for this and am able to articulate this more efffectively.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So - long time no see folks. I have been a bit busy. I have been setting up a few screencasts for Aperture 3 as well as upgrading the infrastructure so deal with the download volume increases. I hope to have one available this weekend - I have finally settled on the format and pricing for them. They are all going to be &#8220;digestible&#8221; Â in terms of run-time. No hour long dissertations and they may have some overlap in terms of content - not much just a little bit to make sure there is context in order for them to also stand alone. All of them will be based on things that I have shown people during workshops or one on one sessions that have universally been determined &#8220;extremely helpful&#8221; during those sessions.</p>

<p>I am not a professional broadcaster - I am not spending a ton of time polishing them in post. I am not using a recording studio for the voice and they will contain NO intro music, advertisements or endorsements. They will be clear - that is about it. They will also focus on things that I do not see all over the place.</p>

<p>I have decide that I am going to price them at a buck ninety nine and two ninety nine solely determined by download size. After a bunch of back of the napkin calculations and guesstimates this is my best guess on breaking even on funds necessary to deal with bandwidth and storage needs - we&#8217;ll see how it goes. I will release the first Aperture 3 screencast as a test to get some feedback before going hog wild.</p>

<p>As for the eBook updates - working hard but it is slow going so my target is the end of the month. I am also working with a friend that I met on the site to translate the eBooks into other languages - yep french and spanish are my goals. Any germans out there that want to help?</p>

<p>I have also been helping a bunch of people convert to Aperture 3 - all of the usual issues with the &#8220;endless processing&#8221; - I have not published a bunch of recipes to &#8220;fix&#8221; this because my experiences have shown no clear one solution or problem that causes this. Some times it is one thing and some times it is another. In some cases I had to resort a binary search to get down to the single image that was hanging up the whole process. So&#8230; if you are having issues that manifest as &#8220;processing&#8221; that never ends and then ends up blocking other things that need to happen&#8230; do not assume there is a one size fits all solution. Most of the rational advice I have seen is not a bad start - mostly to eliminate variables and get to the actual problem projects/images faster. Generically get rid of previews before converting, turn off preview generation, turn off faces, do an import vs a conversion. All good but not an absolute remedy.</p>

<p>On another note I am working on a print service venture with another photographer that some of you might be interested in down the road - big custom prints - really big on fantastic paper for a reasonable price. Hit me up if this sounds like something you need.</p>

<p>Last but not least - I love Apple products but&#8230; God I am angry. In the middle of a project that I must must must get out the door by Tuesday I lost yet another Cinema display to strange random crap that has happened to 3 other Cinema displays I have owned since 2002. Every freaking one of them was about 3 days out of Apple Care. This is bullshit - so what did I do - I bought another one - Â on it&#8217;s way via FedEx. I got the new 24&#8221; - just to finish this project - dumb idea but I need something with decent color to finish this up - not a laptop display. Call me a masochist - based on my history with these things here is what I predict. About 3 weeks from now Apple will replace both the 24 HD and the od 30 with a new 27 that blows the crap out of both of them at a lower price. My new 24 will then work fine for exactly 3 years and break - and then I will by the 27 at too high a price only to be superseded 3 weeks after by something better for less money. My display karma has been shit forever.</p>

<p>Over and out.</p>

Who would have ever guessed? Hey maybe I will start charging for them and get rich. Actually most of them are quick and dirty versions for cameras that I do not own. I am still working on my own presets for cameras that I do own. Nikon cameras. Treat these as starting points that will probably need to be tweaked in order to match NX2 colors and picture control contrast curves.</p>

<p>I will work on other cameras as time permits but until then I made a new category for all of the Nikon related Aperture 3 stuff - it is under the series block. This is to make it easier to find your camera or info you are interested in since nobody used the search box.</p>

<p>Consider this a lame first step to the Nikon Aperture 3 user community that I put out the little survey on.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. If you have any Nikon/Aperture presets or observations feel free to comment or shoot me an email and I will be glad to share them with the billions of other Nikon shooters out there on this site.</p>
