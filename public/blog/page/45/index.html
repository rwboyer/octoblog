I actually tried it out and it works great.</p>

<p>Now I am not a big fan of Twitter. I have an account but don&#8217;t use it much, I follow exactly one other person (actually a group of people) that posts interesting things and resources from a journalistic point of view, not where they are, and what they are eating, or echoing content free crap about Michael Jackson.</p>

<p>I might actually find a use for this plug-in and Twitter. You can get the <a href="http://www.bluecrowbar.com/software/aperture2twitter/">Twitter for Aperture plug-in here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well folks, even though there was a total lack of interest based on the poll numbers I have opened the RB community photo critique group for business. I even posted one of my love/hate images as the first thread to kick it off.</p>

<p>I uploaded a full size scan at a full 8000 pixels a side for those pixel peepers out there that want to gripe about &#8220;sharpness&#8221;, anything goes as long as there is reason along with the comments. I hope it provides for some good discourse and a friendly environment to get some feedback from fellow photo enthusiasts.</p>

<p>I received a couple of comments and emails from people asking me if it is only for &#8220;Pro&#8221; or &#8220;Advanced&#8221; photographers. My firm belief is that all feedback and opinion is valuable one way or another. If &#8220;Pro&#8221; photographers only listened to the opinion of other &#8220;Pro&#8221; photographers on image content, quality, aesthetics, etc. who would the sell their images to? So&#8230; join in, have fun, share your opinion, and do not worry if your images are not &#8220;better&#8221; than those that you share your opinion with. It&#8217;s not a contest.</p>

I have sung the praises of MediaStorm.org in at least one post regarding presentation of your images. I have always been a big fan of fantastic journalism, a fast disappearing art. If you have not checked out MediaStorm yet you really should. The stories are not only compelling but so are the images and presentation. I believe this is the real future of journalism, amazing stuff. Heck I even taught myself Final Cut after seeing MediaStorm a few years ago. If you don&#8217;t want to go that far make due with iMovie for a bit - the &#8216;09 version is perfectly capable of producing fantastic product with a little bit of effort.</p>

<p>Moving on you can check the story out <a href="http://mediastorm.org/0025.htm">here</a>. ThereÂ are a couple things to think about if you take a look at the piece that I linked. If you ever think there is nothing to photograph close to home let this be an inspiration. Now this guy (Danny Wilcox Frazier) spent a long, long time creating this and it shows but I will bet there are a thousand things for you to start work on in your neck of the woods - just make sure it&#8217;s important to you.</p>

<p>Another thing that became obvious as I watched the epilogue and interview at the end with Frazier, namely the camera he chose to shoot with. It appears to be a Leica M6 or M7 which means he shot this on film. To tell you the truth I don&#8217;t know if I would choose to use my Leica gear for a project like this but I just might. Why? Well, the Nikon D3 is a fantastic machine when coupled with my 28-70 AFS but it&#8217;s just too stinking big and intrusive. That thing scares the crap out of all but the most jaded and professional models. The D700 even with a smaller prime would still be a completely different dynamic than the Leica. Where does that leave me? I could buy an M8 if I wanted to spend the cash but that would cause all of my lenses to become virtually obsolete, at least at the wider and normal end of the spectrum. I could go with a Canon G9 or one of the competitors but that would leave me with are really small sensor that bugs the crap out of me when using the maximum apertures afforded in terms of DOF aesthetics. I guess I would probably go with either my Leica or my D700 with smallish lenses.</p>

<p>Just something to think about. God I wish someone like Cosina would make an M-mount full size sensor compact camera that made any kind of monetary sense. Maybe even Nikon hey how about the D700 sensor in an RF body and a couple of really nice F-mount primes from Zeiss? How come my Leica &#8220;full frame&#8221; F1.4 lenses are sooooooo much smaller than my SLR lenses? Even the primes? Damn It! I guess I am back to shooting the Leica for stuff like this, the new micro 4-3 cameras just do not cut it.</p>

<p>I definitely would use Aperture to organize, keyword, caption, and edit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hmmmm. Let me see. How do I fell about the Apple Pro App announcement today. We get Logic Studio and Final Cut version updates with hundreds and hundreds of new features, probably some Snow Leopard tuning yet to be talked about but probably in there. Wait a second, WTF, what happened to Aperture 3 or 2.5 or 2.2?</p>

<p>I will tell you how I feel. I feel alone and abandoned and very very angry. Hey I could be a writer - that is three words starting with &#8220;A&#8221; to describe my feelings. Well maybe not. Anyway why am I not surprised but still a little shocked.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just wanted to share a fantastic printer deal that I found at my local Walmart with all you folks out there. My experience with printers is limited to two categories of printers that I own. The first is the really expensive stuff that I and my colleagues use to produce idiotically big prints. The second are the itty bitty random free letter size printers that the Apple store folks force me into taking no matter how hard I fight it when I buy a new Mac. I have broken down and asked the Apple store folks what is going to take me less time at this point. Much to my chagrin the last free printer that I got was a Canon - it was so freaking good that I have actually bought new ink for it and use it here and there for the random letters, brochures, etc.
Anyway - I went to Walmart today to pick up a printer for a non-photo person today for really really cheap and got a Canon iP2600 - exactly what I was looking for, small, simple, not multi-function, good print quality, low volume, occasional small photos. The grand total $30. Yep the printer with ink cost 70Â¢ LESS than the color and black ink cartridges. Bonus, it came with a USB cable. Oh and it actually looks good.
WTF

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For a tiny little self-promotional break. If any one is interested I will be doing another summer series lighting workshop in or around North Carolina this summer. Here is the idiotically bad web version of the intro meet and greet from last years series of lighting workshops. I hate to make excuses but my laziness + nasty web sharing output from final cut + not loud = not good. Trust me this looks fantastic in HD on a 54 inch + sound + alcohol + models + setting in real life.</p>

<p>Any how email me if you want a spot there are a couple open, I max out at 10.</p>

The synopsis went something like &#8220;A brand new photo magazine, each issue includes 20 unbound photographs from 20 photographers accompanied by essays on photography and interviews.&#8221; Something like that.</p>

<p>I was thinking maybe a Lenswork kind of thing with a folio (a term coined sort of by Lenswork&#8217;s publisher). Cool, considering Lenswork has been one of my favorite photography publications. If you have not seen an issue up close and personal you owe it to yourself to grab at least one issue. Anyway the new publication is called Lay Flat. I couldn&#8217;t wait to subscribe, right up until I looked it up on-line and was underwhelmed, actually I was left flat.</p>

<p>After giving it a real chance. I mean this post is a full three weeks after I first looked at the promotional website. I have gone back numerous times to make sure that I wasn&#8217;t in one of my &#8220;everything sucks&#8221; moods. I carefully considered every photograph linked to issue number one. I even carefully looked through all 20 photographers&#8217; portfolios on more than one occasion. I would call that giving it a chance. My big issue was total lack of diversity. Every single image from every single photographer could have been from any of them. In fact the entire collection could be a single &#8220;body of work&#8221; from any of the included photographers. Mix in that not one single image floated my boat in terms of subject matter, nuance, aesthetic or technical quality and I am left flat.</p>

<p>I am not saying that I did not find one image interesting but hey I love to go through my neighbors family photo albums too. I find them amazingly interesting and generally more coherent. Call me judgmental but I hope to god this does not represent the total lack of diversity in subject matter, approach, treatment, and certainly not the technical ability or aesthetic that artists now aspire to.</p>

<p>Bottom line the format is a great idea but is hopelessly hobbled by the publishers, editors, and self proclaimed &#8220;curators&#8221; (how much more pretentious can we get?) personal taste or lack there of not getting out of the way.</p>

<p>Love to here your thoughts on the matter.</p>

The purpose and focus of the flickr group would be the sharing and growth of all of us. Not a popularity contest, not a group focused on an particular subject matter but a real honest to goodness critique. I think this would be great and the couple of people that I have discussed this with believe that there is a need and desire to get sound feedback from others that love photography.</p>

<p>The gigantic question that I have or more accurately questions are what kind of structure? I really do not want a post and run or forced post one comment three bullshit kind of group but more of a group discussion in a format that is productive and informative for everyone that participates. Here are my thoughts.</p>

<p>1) Invite only group. We will work out how that works but we&#8217;ll make it easy, the invite part is to avert spam.</p>

<p>2) A set of feedback guidelines - not to be restrictive but more to facilitate generation of feedback that is useful.</p>

<p>3) Moderated in such a way every photo in the pool must have a thread, or should we just use comments on the photo as a discussion? Hmmmm. My vote is to have the discussion in the group forum.</p>

<p>4) I am willing to put some time into the critiques but I will absolutely need some help administering the group. Any volunteers?</p>

<p>Anyway anyone out there interested in this kind of flickr group???</p>

<p>[poll id=&#8221;9&#8221;]</p>

<p>Vote with the poll and definitely leave some words in the comments for those that might be interested.</p>

God I love not having to go with the whims and tastes of commercial clients. Okay here is the news, I have recently switched the paper that I use for producing inkjet prints. While I am still in the testing stages for general use papers I have found the &#8220;one&#8221; that I plan on using for black and white digital output.</p>

<p>I do not do this lightly. I do not test every new product that comes to market. I find a product that I like and works the way that I want it to and then I usually stick with it. Every once in a while I hear so many good things about a product from people that I trust, see it in person that I am compelled to check it out for myself. I did and I am floored. If you are really into making prints you have to check this stuff out for yourself as well. Especially if you found your digital black and white prints not quite what you wanted and have been searching for something better as I have.</p>

<p>The paper I am talking about is from a company called Museo. The paper that I am hooked on is their Silver Rag. I have tried a bunch of Museo products and am considering some of their other products but the Silver Rag is a no brainer all engines forward for my black and white output. Check it out. The surface is fantastic, it&#8217;s ability to produce blacks and hold detail in the shadows is fantastic. The highlights are bright without being neon UV treated artificial techno crap. WOW.</p>

<p>Get some from B+H and help me finance the site if you are into it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2001_034_11.jpg"><img title="2001_034_11.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.2001_034_11.jpg" border="0" alt="2001_034_11.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="102" align="left" /></a>I spent about a week calibrating Ilford Delta100 in a couple different developers. I have only ever shot it on 35mm on a few rare occasions. I ultimately decided to stay with Kodak TMAX 100 for both 35mm as well as medium format applications. The Delta 100 was a fantastic film and a worthy competitor to TMAX 100. My decision to stay with TMAX 100 over the Ilford film was purely subjective, I had no technical issues with TMAX 100 as so many others do and I happened to like way TMAX 100 spectral sensitivity rendered caucasian skin tones a little bit better when shooting it unfiltered. In PMK there is virtually no grain, for those of you shooting detailed subjects on 35mm it is fabulous. In medium format it would easily fool you into thinking it was on 4x5 large format blown up to 11x14.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2001_034_11_crop.jpg"><img title="2001_034_11_crop.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.2001_034_11_crop.jpg" border="0" alt="2001_034_11_crop.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="147" align="right" /></a>If you like slightly darker caucasian skin, shoot in smaller formats, want something with no grain, and you don&#8217;t use filters it may be the film for you. I honestly have no idea why someone would shoot FP4 instead of this stuff.</p>

<p>Sample image is a strait 4000 DPI scan of a 35mm negative during one of my calibration tests, shot with a Leica M6 and 50mm Summicron, hand held. My EI for this film in PMK turned out to be ISO 80. No sharpening as usual.</p>
