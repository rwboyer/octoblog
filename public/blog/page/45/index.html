  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/DSC_0315_Viveza.jpg"><img title="DSC_0315_Viveza.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/.thumbs/.DSC_0315_Viveza.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_0315_Viveza.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="100" align="left" /></a>I still use Adobe Photoshop, in fact I just upgraded to CS4 a little while ago but what I use it for is becoming more and more specialized and far less frequent. Maybe I will do a rundown on exactly what I use it for some other day. The reason that I use it far less than I used to is due to Nik Software, specifically Nik Viveza.</p>

<p>I was first introduced to Nik Software&#8217;s unique way of doing things in Nikon NX and NX2. NX and NX2 come with color control points built-in, Viveza is a plug-in for Aperture and Adobe products that pretty much boils down to color control points. NX2 goes beyond that in allowing you to use control points as masks for anything else NX2 can do as well but I will stick to color control pointsÂ as this is what Viveza does. I used to use Photoshop for local adjustments and I still do but 90% of what I do for my personal work can be done with Viveza. In fact it is so easy and intuitive that I rather use Viveza than other methods of making selections and masks if I can.</p>

<p>The Nik Software website has a far better tutorial on what control points are and how they work than I would care to put together. Instead of a walk through I will be brief and just show a practical example of one of the ways that I use Viveza as well as my opinion on the variations of packaging from Nik and my opinions on what you should buy. One word of caution that cannot be repeated enough, do not interpret this example as how Viveza can rescue a really bad photograph and make a good one. This example is how Viveza can help you get what you want from a scene quickly and easily if you know where you want to go.</p>

<p>The image at the top of the post is a pretty much final version of an image that I have had a number of discussions with on-line iBuddiesâ„¢ regarding &#8220;how I did it&#8221;. I produced it as a black and white using Nik Silver EFEX and the people were very interested in the post processing so I figured I would do a color version with Viveza for your pleasure (or not). Here is the original image strait out of camera using Aperture&#8217;s default RAW conversion.</p>

<p><img title="DSC_0315original.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/DSC_0315original.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_0315original.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="700" height="469" /></p>

<p>Bleahhhk, but not an accident. I shot it this way because I know exactly what my camera does and planned to produce a black and white version using Silver EFEX. This image&#8217;s entire reason to exist from my point of view was the sky and the reflections in the water. I wanted it to have a feeling that it was late in the day (it was 6/24/09 at 8pm right around the summer solstice). The only thing that I wanted to make sure of was that I could ratchet the hell out of the contrast while while retaining detail in the brightest clouds, reflections in the water, and detail in the ripples on the water without going totally white or totally black. For my taste most images with really strong clouds that have the contrast ratcheted up end up blowing out the whites in the bright areas of the clouds. The problem with that is the clouds look like they are made out of cement and loose the gaseous vapor feeling in those images, especially on paper.</p>

<p>Moving on, this is the version I sent into Viveza.</p>

<p><img title="DSC_0315adjusted.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/DSC_0315adjusted.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_0315adjusted.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="700" height="468" /></p>

<p>Wow, that&#8217;s a whole lot better, nice. For those interested this took about 10 seconds in Aperture in the following order:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Boosted the contrast to get the overall separation I was looking for.</li>
    <li>Bumped up the brightness a tad until the whitest part of the clouds still had the detail I wanted.</li>
    <li>Now that I could see where all the colors were hiding I cooled the white balance a hair to get the sky and blue water reflections where I wanted them while retaining the golden sun on the sunlit sides clouds, boats, and water.</li>
    <li>Bumped up the definition a hair to make the tiny little boats and ripples stand out a little more.</li>
    <li>Bumped up the vibrance a bit until the sky had the exact tone that I wanted without blowing the blue channel and it going all primary color on me.</li>
    <li>Bumped up the shadows a hair, mainly to give them some breathing room for the torture I was about to subject them to in Vivza. I find that the shadow slider in Aperture in combination with the &#8220;advanced&#8221; controls does a way better job in boosting the shadows into a usable range while maintaining good color than just about any other tool i have used. Bottom line - you could use Viveza to make the shadows a little bit brighter but it does not do as good a job so do it before you send it out of Aperture.</li>
</ol>


<p>And here is the version with local adjustments done in Viveza in about a minute with a couple of control points.</p>

<p><img title="DSC_0315_Viveza.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/DSC_0315_Viveza.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_0315_Viveza.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="700" height="468" /></p>

<p>Here is a conceptual description of what I did. If you give <a style="&quot;border:none" href="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26store-name%3Dsoftware%26redirect%3Dtrue%26search-type%3Dss%26index%3Dsoftware%26ref%3Dbl%255Fsr%255Fsoftware%26field-brandtextbin%3DNik%2520Software&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&quot;&gt;Name Your Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=">Viveza</a> a trial spin you will know why a conceptual description is good enough. If any of you think it would be helpful I could be convinced to post a screen-cast of the actual Viveza session from start to finish.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Control point(s) in the water on the brightest reflection to boost the brightness and contrast.</li>
    <li>Control points in the grey/neutral clouds on on the horizon set to do nothing in order to subtract the water selection from the sky.</li>
    <li>Control point on the clouds at the right to boost contrast a hair.</li>
    <li>Control point(s) on the bluest of blue sky to bring down the brightness a hair.</li>
</ol>


<p>The bottom line is Vivza and control points are actually fun to use, they encourage you to try things and variations on things that you may not do if you had to go through laborious convolutions to mask them. The fact is after you use control points in Viveza, NX2, or the other Nik Software products, just about any other way of making selections seems laborious.</p>

<p>Nik sells Viveza in a couple of different ways in a couple of different bundles that seem to change fairly often over the life of the product. The key differentiator is one works with Photoshop and the other will ONLY work in Aperture. If you do not own Photoshop and never ever want to use Photoshop get the version or bundle that will only work with Aperture. If you own Photoshop get the one that works with Photoshop, even if you never or rarely use it. In fact personally images from Aperture to Photoshop just to use Viveza even though I can do it either way. You may ask why - the answer is that I make the image in PS a smart object and then render the Viveza plugin on the smart object. I do this because all of the control points are saved and can be re-tweaked later without reproducing the whole shooting match from scratch. This seems trivial to do an I wonder why the Aperture plug-in mechanism does not work this way. I sure hope that it does in the future.</p>

<p>Ps. Let me know if a screen-cast of the session would be helpful.

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/DSC_0300___Version_2__1_.jpg"><img title="DSC_0300___Version_2__1_.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/.thumbs/.DSC_0300___Version_2__1_.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_0300___Version_2__1_.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="101" align="left" /></a>Just wanted to share a couple of random tidbits from the week of stuff that I learned or relearned or haven&#8217;t thought about for a while that some of you may find useful. Like most of you I figure things out by intent or accident about 700 times a day and always say &#8220;I should write that down&#8221; - I never do but I say it anyway. This week I decided that at least I would pass along a couple Apple/Photo/Aperture related things that a couple of you may enjoy. Your milage could vary.</p>

<p>I had to make a quick print of the attached image and did not feel like changing ink sets for my &#8220;pro&#8221; printer so I made one on one of my trusty free printers from Apple, specifically the Canon PIXMA iP4200 that I usually use for invoices and such. Anyway to make a long story short I remembered that when I tested it a couple of years ago with the free Canon photo paper that was included I was actually impressed with the color accuracy and overall quality given that I was using direct printing from Aperture (no RIP) and the indecipherable profiles that Canon provides were unbelievably accurate and actually did expand the gamut of the printer to more closely resemble AdobeRGB. Soooo I had only 4x6 Canon paper left but a gaggle of HP advanced photo glossy that I got for free somewhere in 8.5x11. I figured I would give it a try considering I am lazy and was not about to profile the printer paper combination.</p>

<p>Guess what! Using the Canon SP2 (Canon Photo Plus Paper) profile with the HP advanced glossy looked fantastic. Out of curiosity I printed the same image on the Canon 4x6 paper and they looked identical. Bottom line - if you have a Canon the SP2 ICC profile is a perfect match when using HP advanced glossy if you are in a pinch.</p>

<p>Moving on here is a big surprise that I also stumbled upon by complete accident. I was using my iPhone headphones with my new Unibody MacBook Pro and guess what I discovered. The little microphone works when plugged into the MacBookPro headphone jack. This is fantastic considering I am a big-time Skype user and can now eliminate one more thing that I carry when I travel, namely my USB microphone. I hate the sound quality using the built in mic on the MacBook, you just cannot get close enough and it picks up too much ambient. I have no idea when this started to work hardware wise but if you have a unibody or something around that vintage try it. You gotta love apple for including things like this. Is it documented anywhere? I&#8217;ve never seen it anywhere from Apple.</p>

<p>Last but not least for those that use Aperture. I re-re-re learned the best way to solve random wackiness in behavior when printing directly from Aperture, like what I experienced with borderless printing not working for my quick and dirty print, is to trash the printing preferences and presets in the ~Library/ApplicationSupport/Aperture directory. I forgot this because I have been using the ColorByte RIP for a long time now to deal with my printing needs.</p>

I actually tried it out and it works great.</p>

<p>Now I am not a big fan of Twitter. I have an account but don&#8217;t use it much, I follow exactly one other person (actually a group of people) that posts interesting things and resources from a journalistic point of view, not where they are, and what they are eating, or echoing content free crap about Michael Jackson.</p>

<p>I might actually find a use for this plug-in and Twitter. You can get the <a href="http://www.bluecrowbar.com/software/aperture2twitter/">Twitter for Aperture plug-in here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well folks, even though there was a total lack of interest based on the poll numbers I have opened the RB community photo critique group for business. I even posted one of my love/hate images as the first thread to kick it off.</p>

<p>I uploaded a full size scan at a full 8000 pixels a side for those pixel peepers out there that want to gripe about &#8220;sharpness&#8221;, anything goes as long as there is reason along with the comments. I hope it provides for some good discourse and a friendly environment to get some feedback from fellow photo enthusiasts.</p>

<p>I received a couple of comments and emails from people asking me if it is only for &#8220;Pro&#8221; or &#8220;Advanced&#8221; photographers. My firm belief is that all feedback and opinion is valuable one way or another. If &#8220;Pro&#8221; photographers only listened to the opinion of other &#8220;Pro&#8221; photographers on image content, quality, aesthetics, etc. who would the sell their images to? So&#8230; join in, have fun, share your opinion, and do not worry if your images are not &#8220;better&#8221; than those that you share your opinion with. It&#8217;s not a contest.</p>

I have sung the praises of MediaStorm.org in at least one post regarding presentation of your images. I have always been a big fan of fantastic journalism, a fast disappearing art. If you have not checked out MediaStorm yet you really should. The stories are not only compelling but so are the images and presentation. I believe this is the real future of journalism, amazing stuff. Heck I even taught myself Final Cut after seeing MediaStorm a few years ago. If you don&#8217;t want to go that far make due with iMovie for a bit - the &#8216;09 version is perfectly capable of producing fantastic product with a little bit of effort.</p>

<p>Moving on you can check the story out <a href="http://mediastorm.org/0025.htm">here</a>. ThereÂ are a couple things to think about if you take a look at the piece that I linked. If you ever think there is nothing to photograph close to home let this be an inspiration. Now this guy (Danny Wilcox Frazier) spent a long, long time creating this and it shows but I will bet there are a thousand things for you to start work on in your neck of the woods - just make sure it&#8217;s important to you.</p>

<p>Another thing that became obvious as I watched the epilogue and interview at the end with Frazier, namely the camera he chose to shoot with. It appears to be a Leica M6 or M7 which means he shot this on film. To tell you the truth I don&#8217;t know if I would choose to use my Leica gear for a project like this but I just might. Why? Well, the Nikon D3 is a fantastic machine when coupled with my 28-70 AFS but it&#8217;s just too stinking big and intrusive. That thing scares the crap out of all but the most jaded and professional models. The D700 even with a smaller prime would still be a completely different dynamic than the Leica. Where does that leave me? I could buy an M8 if I wanted to spend the cash but that would cause all of my lenses to become virtually obsolete, at least at the wider and normal end of the spectrum. I could go with a Canon G9 or one of the competitors but that would leave me with are really small sensor that bugs the crap out of me when using the maximum apertures afforded in terms of DOF aesthetics. I guess I would probably go with either my Leica or my D700 with smallish lenses.</p>

<p>Just something to think about. God I wish someone like Cosina would make an M-mount full size sensor compact camera that made any kind of monetary sense. Maybe even Nikon hey how about the D700 sensor in an RF body and a couple of really nice F-mount primes from Zeiss? How come my Leica &#8220;full frame&#8221; F1.4 lenses are sooooooo much smaller than my SLR lenses? Even the primes? Damn It! I guess I am back to shooting the Leica for stuff like this, the new micro 4-3 cameras just do not cut it.</p>

<p>I definitely would use Aperture to organize, keyword, caption, and edit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hmmmm. Let me see. How do I fell about the Apple Pro App announcement today. We get Logic Studio and Final Cut version updates with hundreds and hundreds of new features, probably some Snow Leopard tuning yet to be talked about but probably in there. Wait a second, WTF, what happened to Aperture 3 or 2.5 or 2.2?</p>

<p>I will tell you how I feel. I feel alone and abandoned and very very angry. Hey I could be a writer - that is three words starting with &#8220;A&#8221; to describe my feelings. Well maybe not. Anyway why am I not surprised but still a little shocked.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just wanted to share a fantastic printer deal that I found at my local Walmart with all you folks out there. My experience with printers is limited to two categories of printers that I own. The first is the really expensive stuff that I and my colleagues use to produce idiotically big prints. The second are the itty bitty random free letter size printers that the Apple store folks force me into taking no matter how hard I fight it when I buy a new Mac. I have broken down and asked the Apple store folks what is going to take me less time at this point. Much to my chagrin the last free printer that I got was a Canon - it was so freaking good that I have actually bought new ink for it and use it here and there for the random letters, brochures, etc.
Anyway - I went to Walmart today to pick up a printer for a non-photo person today for really really cheap and got a Canon iP2600 - exactly what I was looking for, small, simple, not multi-function, good print quality, low volume, occasional small photos. The grand total $30. Yep the printer with ink cost 70Â¢ LESS than the color and black ink cartridges. Bonus, it came with a USB cable. Oh and it actually looks good.
WTF

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For a tiny little self-promotional break. If any one is interested I will be doing another summer series lighting workshop in or around North Carolina this summer. Here is the idiotically bad web version of the intro meet and greet from last years series of lighting workshops. I hate to make excuses but my laziness + nasty web sharing output from final cut + not loud = not good. Trust me this looks fantastic in HD on a 54 inch + sound + alcohol + models + setting in real life.</p>

<p>Any how email me if you want a spot there are a couple open, I max out at 10.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/DSC_0315v2.jpg"><img title="DSC_0315v2.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/.thumbs/.DSC_0315v2.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_0315v2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="101" align="left" /></a>I am always on the lookout for new photo publications that I might enjoy so you can imagine how excited I was when I learned of a new publication that sounded right up my alley. The synopsis went something like &#8220;A brand new photo magazine, each issue includes 20 unbound photographs from 20 photographers accompanied by essays on photography and interviews.&#8221; Something like that.</p>

<p>I was thinking maybe a Lenswork kind of thing with a folio (a term coined sort of by Lenswork&#8217;s publisher). Cool, considering Lenswork has been one of my favorite photography publications. If you have not seen an issue up close and personal you owe it to yourself to grab at least one issue. Anyway the new publication is called Lay Flat. I couldn&#8217;t wait to subscribe, right up until I looked it up on-line and was underwhelmed, actually I was left flat.</p>

<p>After giving it a real chance. I mean this post is a full three weeks after I first looked at the promotional website. I have gone back numerous times to make sure that I wasn&#8217;t in one of my &#8220;everything sucks&#8221; moods. I carefully considered every photograph linked to issue number one. I even carefully looked through all 20 photographers&#8217; portfolios on more than one occasion. I would call that giving it a chance. My big issue was total lack of diversity. Every single image from every single photographer could have been from any of them. In fact the entire collection could be a single &#8220;body of work&#8221; from any of the included photographers. Mix in that not one single image floated my boat in terms of subject matter, nuance, aesthetic or technical quality and I am left flat.</p>

<p>I am not saying that I did not find one image interesting but hey I love to go through my neighbors family photo albums too. I find them amazingly interesting and generally more coherent. Call me judgmental but I hope to god this does not represent the total lack of diversity in subject matter, approach, treatment, and certainly not the technical ability or aesthetic that artists now aspire to.</p>

<p>Bottom line the format is a great idea but is hopelessly hobbled by the publishers, editors, and self proclaimed &#8220;curators&#8221; (how much more pretentious can we get?) personal taste or lack there of not getting out of the way.</p>

<p>Love to here your thoughts on the matter.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/2002_006_11.jpg"><img title="2002_006_11.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/.thumbs/.2002_006_11.jpg" border="0" alt="2002_006_11.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="149" height="150" align="left" /></a>A few readers and I have been discussing the creation of a new group on flickr. The purpose and focus of the flickr group would be the sharing and growth of all of us. Not a popularity contest, not a group focused on an particular subject matter but a real honest to goodness critique. I think this would be great and the couple of people that I have discussed this with believe that there is a need and desire to get sound feedback from others that love photography.</p>

<p>The gigantic question that I have or more accurately questions are what kind of structure? I really do not want a post and run or forced post one comment three bullshit kind of group but more of a group discussion in a format that is productive and informative for everyone that participates. Here are my thoughts.</p>

<p>1) Invite only group. We will work out how that works but we&#8217;ll make it easy, the invite part is to avert spam.</p>

<p>2) A set of feedback guidelines - not to be restrictive but more to facilitate generation of feedback that is useful.</p>

<p>3) Moderated in such a way every photo in the pool must have a thread, or should we just use comments on the photo as a discussion? Hmmmm. My vote is to have the discussion in the group forum.</p>

<p>4) I am willing to put some time into the critiques but I will absolutely need some help administering the group. Any volunteers?</p>

<p>Anyway anyone out there interested in this kind of flickr group???</p>

<p>[poll id=&#8221;9&#8221;]</p>

<p>Vote with the poll and definitely leave some words in the comments for those that might be interested.</p>
