  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yep - I love surfing eBay every once in a while. I might even be able to make a living doing it if I had the attention span of an adult. I swear I only log in once a month at the most (averaged throughout a year). Every time I end up buying some sort of bargain. I spend no more than five minutes. I usually do it when some object crosses my mind for a random reason. I search for the item and then look at a grand total of two pages. The first is buy-now just listed page - only place you find giant buy now bargains. The second page is auction-only ending soonest. That&#8217;s it. If I see a bargain I buy it.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s recap that last 6 months or so.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Pristine - like new Nikon FM black paint WITH a pristine Nikon AIS 50mm F 1.8 $100</li>
    <li>Mint I do meant MINT Nikon FM2 crome $125</li>
    <li>Perfect Nikon F3 HP WITH 50mm AI 2.0 $125</li>
    <li>Rolleiflex TLR w/ 2.8 Xenar Schneider  $100</li>
    <li>Mint Leica 90mm 2.8 Latest pre-elmarit (this is very very good) $495</li>
</ul>


<p>I could go on and on if I do all of last year but I won&#8217;t. Today I scored a really nice 50mm AIS 1.4. Yes a 1.4. For $99 in a just listed buy it now. This is at least 50 bucks better than most of the ones I see that are also &#8220;bargains&#8221;. This is a fantastic deal even if you shoot digital. Seriously, If you shoot FX do you even have a 1.4 anything - a normal with large aperture is very useful. Shoot DX? How about a really nice fast portrait lens. How can this thing NOT be worth $99?</p>

<p>Oh it has a 7 day return policy so I will shoot it as soon as it gets here. What do I end up doing with this stuff you ask? Well&#8230;</p>

<ul>
    <li>Use it - I still shoot film and it works on my digital stuff as well. I use it when I want to shoot like I don&#8217;t give a crap. It really is nice not having to worry about my gear getting hurt. I have a ton of backups. I have like 4 50mm AIS Nikon 1.4 lenses. I have a million Nikon $100 film bodies that are mechanical shooting beasts and a bunch of &#8220;obsolete&#8221; digital as well. I love shooting in the rain or &#8220;dangerous&#8221; places like a bar with gear that I have a bunch more at home and only cost me a few dollars. Guess what - none of it has been hurt. Maybe I need to be more risky? Anyway you slice it it is good way to relax vs $10,000 worth of new digital gear. If you think that won&#8217;t make a difference in your images you are probably wrong.</li>
    <li>Play with it - yep. I love playing with this stuff and it&#8217;s cheap.</li>
    <li>Give it away - Yes I give it to deserving people that actually care about making images. My daughter is delighted with the Nikon film kit I gave her last summer. Remember when you were a kid - wouldn&#8217;t you like to have gotten something like that &#8220;out of the blue&#8221;.</li>
    <li>Sell it - occasionally I will sell it at a profit. There are a ton of trends I have seen over the last few years that I could have made money on if I was concentrating on it. Sometimes I have just because I knew a few items were bargains, bought them because I was familiar with how great the gear was, sold them at an immense profit because I got a bargain of a bargain - a low priced item in a temporarily depressed market, a year and a half ago there was a bunch of Hasselblad gear going for idiotically low prices. I got a few really really good deals and guess what. The prices shot up across the board last year so I unloaded some of it. Not all of it - the profit paid for a lot of my acquisitions.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here is my new beauty of a 50mm - nice huh? Ob it came with a Nikon hood as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>That&#8217;s a fairly harsh title. I am not sure if it is totally accurate in my meaning either. In any case let&#8217;s just go with that title and expand the meaning a little with a few additional sentences. First addition - automatic functions that go hand in hand with digital also suck. Yes, of course you can turn them off or not use them but wait a  second and see what I am talking about here. All of this is coming from my continual self conflict in shooting with cameras I love - mostly film cameras vs. shooting digital with cameras I don&#8217;t love so much and trying to get to the bottom of why I feel this way.</p>

<p>The end of this thought process is obviously the goal of removing the internal conflict that I have. I am not there yet and today is bash digital day for me. Don&#8217;t take this too seriously as I have equal respect and admiration for digital and some of the new and amazing things that my itty bitty cameras can do. For those of you that don&#8217;t ever want to touch film again please read on as there may be a few tidbits in my list that at least make you think about how you shoot no matter what medium and device you choose on a given day. One disclaimer here - I am going to be blaming a lot of my own personal shortcomings on the gear but have no doubt they are things that I fall prey to when shooting digital as much as the next guy.</p>

<p>Here we go&#8230;</p>

<ul>
    <li> Autofocus sucks for 90% of most things you want to take a picture of. Really it does. It&#8217;s really not that precise and even when you &#8220;choose&#8221; the focus point yourself there really isn&#8217;t a whole lot of thought process involved for the vast majority of shots you take. This is really a bad thing. The reason this is really bad is that for the most part AF is going to do about the same thing you would do on 90% of your shots but your thought process will be disengaged most of the time. The 10% of the shots that you really should be more cognizant of focus point and all the related things are relegated to the same degree of carelessness as everything else. Too bad these are the ones that you are working for in the first place and the other 90% of &#8220;okay&#8221; are just that &#8220;okay&#8221;. They belong in the trash. In fact 100% of your stuff is &#8220;okay&#8221; Not good. Yea yea you can switch to manual focus but to be blunt - EVERY SINGLE AF focusing system I have EVER seen is completely useless for manual focus compared to virtually every manual focusing screen/system/rangefinder/etc.</li>
    <li>Auto ISO + Program mode = Slouchy images. Again no thought at choosing. Again for the most part that makes things &#8220;okay&#8221;. Too bad most of everyone&#8217;s images at all levels of the game are absolute dog shit from the get go. Great technically okay images of complete dog shit. And again - because you are not thinking most of the time when &#8220;it doesn&#8217;t matter&#8221; because you are shooting dog shit, you are also not thinking when the one image that coulda been a contender is in front of you - hence it&#8217;s relegated to the same as the rest of the dog shit.</li>
    <li>High ISO - it&#8217;s all the rage. What do people endlessly look for when buying a new camera? OOOOOOooooooh - Ahhhhhhhhhhh - look ma no noise at ISO 9,000,000 now I can shoot images at high shutter speeds in crappy light. Amazing, I blame high iso for a lot of ills and none of those are noise or &#8220;image quality&#8221; like color saturation or sharpness. They are low quality because no you can do more shooting with even less thinking. Pile on top of that the fact that you are almost NEVER going to shoot with a slow shutter speed when you don&#8217;t have to. This translates into boring most of the time unless you are consciously doing &#8220;slow shutter speed experiments&#8221;. Great - those experiments almost always fall into the StupidCrap™ category of brick walls and other &#8220;test subjects&#8221;. Want some cool images - try shooting at ISO 100 for everything. Believe me you will figure out that most of the light you were shooting in is crap. Yes plenty of low light is fantastic light but you will find yourself being way more sensitive to what the light really looks like - where it&#8217;s coming from - how you might expose the shot - what motion there might be - how it will look. There is the key - HOW IT WILL LOOK.</li>
    <li>Post processing sucks. Face it - 99% of images are crap. This applies to everyone. Everybody knows this. The longer you have been doing it, the more you know it. Now here&#8217;s the rub with &#8220;easy&#8221; post processing. Experienced photographers one way or another spend WAY too much time screwing with crap images that should go in the trash - or at least not have any time spent on them at all. I am serious - when the post processing has some &#8220;cost&#8221; associated with it in terms of $ or time the &#8220;okay&#8221; images are relegated to nowhere&#8217;sville where they belong. As a result the rest of the world get&#8217;s to see these &#8220;okay&#8221; images tarted up with color and contrast - great, just freaking great.</li>
    <li>Too much apparent dynamic range. That&#8217;s right - too much. I am not talking about the actual DR - just forget about that for a second. Even me that detests HDR does not thing enough about highlight and shadow and where they should be for a particular image. The formula is to just make sure you don&#8217;t loose the highlights and that&#8217;s when we all give a hoot at all. Eventually these thoughtless images will be treated to so fake fill light as well complements of our favorite digital tool of the day. Hooray - BORING and most likely awful.</li>
</ul>


<p>You can see a couple of themes here - why bother with deciding stuff when the camera decides the same thing as you do? Well it does most of the time. Too bad most of the time is when you are &#8220;testing&#8221;, shooting images that suck anyway, etc. That&#8217;s all time you should be deciding so that you will  decide &#8220;right&#8221; based on what the heck you want when the one in a hundred images is in front of you. The other theme is too much choice. Hmmm should I shoot at ISO 100 and a slow shutter speed or ISO 1600 and a fast shutter. Guess which one wins? Would the image have been better with a little motion blur? You&#8217;ll never know. If you only had ISO 100 I guess you would - one way or another. More specifically the garbage would be garbage anyway - just more apparent - and the one that &#8220;turns out&#8221; will be fantastic. Hmmm the shadows are dark - they need to be boosted. Always wins - maybe it shouldn&#8217;t and you should have thought about it way way before hand. You get the idea.</p>

<p>I will leave you with this. An image made by a friend <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/">Les Picker</a> - a long long time ago. It was made using very simple equipment and to tell you the truth it was a random image picked out of a batch without a light table just when I was over at his office a few days ago. I just wanted an old slide to see if my crappy scanner could do better than his crappy scanner that he used years ago to digitize a few images. Most of those images he doesn&#8217;t use because the scans are so bad. I think that is a mistake and am trying to convince him to invest some time in going through his old images and see what potential there is. In any case here is a strait scan and resize from a Kodachrome slide. No fuss - no choice - no HDR - no digital fill light - no curves - no messing with the color - no &#8220;WB&#8221; adjustments. Just a freaking picture.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Actually 3 bags - you heard me correctly - THREE new bags/cases. If I continue at this pace I will have more cases for things than I actually have things. This is absolutely insane. I am not even talking about camera bags at this point. These are other kinds of bags and cases.</p>

<p>In a day or two the post will see to my doorstep the following three new bags.</p>

<ul>
    <li>This new <a href="http://www.crumpler.com/us/Casual-and-Messenger-Bags/Daypacks-Hydration-Packs/Herbas-S.html?LanguageCode=EN&amp;SKU=HBS002-R00110">Crumpler case that I will try to fit my Macbook Air into</a> - if it doesn&#8217;t work, I&#8217;ll send it back.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.crumpler.com/us/Laptop-Bags/Laptop-Messenger-Bags/Moderate-Embarrassment.html?LanguageCode=EN&amp;SKU=MET000-T00130">This Bag is also for my MacBook Air when I want other stuff to</a>. This one is staying as I will probably end up with a 13&#8221; Air at some point and all my current laptop+stuff bags are tuned for MacBook Pro 15&#8221; laptops. Yes I have a bunch of those as well.</li>
    <li>While I was on a this particular binge I thought I would pick <a href="http://www.jetpens.com/index.php/product/view/products_id/875">this pencil bag up as well</a>. Yes I am on some very strange mailing lists because I am very very particular about buying certain items that I use a lot of and most of what you can find at &#8220;normal&#8221; places just will not cut it for me. I probably spend about $100/month at this place alone.</li>
</ul>


<p>I am very afraid I need serious help and counseling.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This may seem a little off topic but let&#8217;s categorize it under the &#8220;rants&#8221; section (note to self - need &#8220;rants&#8221; category). I have been messing about with cameras and photo kit for a long time, as in 30+ years. Along the way I have run into and even bought cameras and equipment that I really tried hard to love and just couldn&#8217;t. I am not talking about reading a bunch of hype and building my expectations up soooooo much that I was bound to be disappointed. That has happened too but I classify that as a &#8220;my own damn fault&#8221; kind of issue not a product issue.</p>

<p>What I am talking about here is a product that the underlying philosophy is both sound and tuned into a way of thinking that suits me. A product that actually has some attributes that are admirable, some features that no body else does, maybe even a piece of engineering or technology, or something that could be considered brilliant but&#8230; As taken as a whole is so fundamentally flawed in ways that make it unbearable, possibly even maddening. Flaws that you try your best to overlook, work around, get comfortable with, find excuses for, get used to, but are sooooo nagging that they eventually cannot be excused.</p>

<p>One of the first products that fall into this category I had experience with was the Contax G series. Let me review the score card for you in case you are not intimately familiar with this &#8220;coulda been a contender&#8221; camera and lens system. My list of things may seem trivial and trite and not too technical but trust me on this and give my assessment here the benefit of the doubt. First the &#8220;pros&#8221;</p>

<ul>
    <li>Absolutely gorgeous - great design - really nice materials - felt as good as it looked - Niiiiiiicee piece of gear  by any measure. Actually art in and of itself. Titanium. ohhhhh ahhhhh,</li>
    <li>Classic brilliantly executed super quality lenses - some of them actually quite innovated while maintaining a nostalgic link to the traditions of photography. Take the Hologon for instance. Performance was fantastic too.</li>
    <li>Philosophy was exactly what I was looking for - the best old ideas -rangefinder form factor and lens design flexibility , with modern design, technology and features blended together in a super posh compact, make no excuses package.</li>
    <li>Tiny</li>
</ul>


<p>Now for the &#8220;cons&#8221;</p>

<ul>
    <li>Extremely slow auto focus - mostly because or at least due to the sloooooow grinding, plastic-y sounding, annoying lens drive motor. Absolutely awful. Not only was it slow but to add insult to injury it was grating to actually listen to while it was doing it&#8217;s business. Honestly it sounded so bad and strained that you fully expected it to break every time it focused.</li>
    <li>No issue I will just use the manual focus all will be well. Hey there is a really cool looking and nice feeling focus dial on it. WRONG! after you focused manually the horrible sounding sloooooow motor would drive the lens to the focus position when you pressed the shutter half way before firing the camera. Urrrrrrr. It did this every shot - not just once. UrrrrrrrrrrrrrGrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrGrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnddddd click.</li>
</ul>


<p>I gave this thing like 10 rolls trying every which way to love it. I had EVERY lens made for it including the Hologon. Ended up sitting doing nothing for like 4 years. Sold it at a loss. The reason I bring this up is how I am reminded of the G series with the last product that I just couldn&#8217;t love. You remember my brief excursion with the Sigma DP1s don&#8217;t you?</p>

<p>The Sigma DP1 and DP2 are cameras that I really want to love but couldn&#8217;t. I have the DP1 a week of seriously trying to find a way to work with it but just could not do it. It was too annoying. Call me weak but the short comings, even though not critical to my intended use, were so unbelievable that asking myself &#8220;why? why? why?&#8221; was  huge distraction. How could this simple camera philosphy that I am ready made to eat up go so horribly wrong.</p>

<p>Plan - really good lens with really good and unique sensor design at a bit of a price premium. Hmmmmm sounds like my cup of tea. Here are my list of WTF&#8217;s.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Sigma has upped the ante in the contest for &#8220;the slowest, most horrible sounding, longest lasting, most plastic-y, gear grinding atrocity, ever conceived&#8221; prize. This will be hard to beat if I actually tried to engineer something as bad on purpose that worked more than once.</li>
    <li>It also places very high on the &#8220;really bad looking and feeling materials used but probably better than they seem&#8221; category. It&#8217;s sort of hard to explain unless you see and feel they way this thing is made. All the &#8220;rights&#8221; done sorta right makes a horrendous wrong kind of thing.</li>
    <li>Sigma = &#8220;Ah wee design berrry berrry best honorble lens for photographer in dis wondaful camrah.&#8221; Me - Hmmmm, hmmmmm, hmmmmm. Yea it&#8217;s a, kinda, like sharp, but&#8230;. HOW FORKING HARD IS IT TO PUT SOMETHING GOOD AT BETTER THAN F FREAKING 4? F 4 you are joking aren&#8217;t you? You&#8217;re not?</li>
    <li>4 megapixels at a blistering frame rate of 1 shot every 3.6 hours. Want maybe a second shot of the sunset? Too bad it went away. If I want something this slow I will shoot sheet film, that Foveon thing is nice and all but it&#8217;s not that good.</li>
</ul>


<p>Seriously, it pains me to see a product that targets ME and what I want and care about in a camera to be so horribly flawed. Here is what could be done to make this thing FANTASTIC.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Make it as fast as the panasonic GF1 or at least close. That cannot be sooooo out of reach. It can&#8217;t be. The GF1 is what I would call - okay. In other words it doesn&#8217;t make itself noticed one way or the other. It&#8217;s not blisteringly fast in any category but is not so so slow that it&#8217;s annoying to use.</li>
    <li>Keep the 4 megapixel sensor and keep multiplying all things by 3 if you want. Who cares, the market you are going for is sophisticated enough to know what is what no matter what math you guys use. Want a grand slam? Put that new sensor in it you know the one in the up coming SD-1. I do mean a grand slam. You guys will be getting Leica market if you do.</li>
    <li> Oh yea you can keep the built in lens if you want. Just make the lenses actually lust worthy. Not just in terms of sharpness/distortion but in terms of Aperture. How about F 2.0? That is in the &#8220;worth looking at&#8221; category. Want a super duper super galactic out of the solar system grand slam - do an F1.4. Want a out of the out of the universe grand slam? Make it Micro 4:3 lens compatible somehow. Your sensor is really close in size is it not? You figure it out you are the engineering company.</li>
    <li>Hire a design and materials guy - seriously. Up the price of the camera a bit. Use all the cash for the design guy and his materials budget. Make it somewhere in the semi lust-worthy kit category. Make it gorgeous and you win. Get it somewhere near the GF-1/X-1/EP-1 and you are at least in the game.</li>
    <li>Give it that really cool fuji X100 hybrid finder next year - WOW.  Do something the same only &#8220;better&#8221; than the Fuji hybrid finder - Triple WOW.</li>
</ul>


<p>The only reason I am writing this is that people that the DP1/DP2 are targeted at (like me) will start repeating the same thing over and over and over agin until somebody gets it. Honestly - Sigma and Foveon X3 would be the perfect sensor for what I am talking about. It really does have it&#8217;s strong points. Great color. Nice DR, Unique &#8220;sharpness&#8221; and detail rendering. Now if only those guys could make a camera that is useable in a form factor that nobody has gotten perfect yet. Well the M9 is close but also has it&#8217;s issues - price being one of them. Honestly if Sigma Nailed this camera recipe with their Foveon  sensor in a couple of variations for somewhere under $2000 they would clean up. Look at everyone, including me lining up for the Fuji X100 sight unseen.</p>

<p>Now imagine that with the unique qualities of the Foveon X3 that will be in the SD1 sensor. That is like 15 megapixels WITHOUT the retarded Foveon math. Perfect.</p>

<p>Here is a crop out of the edge of an image from a Foveon at 100% with NO sharpening or color adjustment - all RAW settings flat/flat/flat/flat.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just some Random Crap™ that I had laying around my very very messy Mac desktop. Nothing special. Strait scans off my not too too wonderful scanner that I randomly scanned a while ago. I am not being facetious, I am actually emotionally affected here. Now that it&#8217;s really the end for Kodachrome. I mean this is the first month that it was actually and really impossible to shoot and process.</p>

<p>I already advocate using film, at least occasionally for everyone that takes photography seriously before it all goes. It really is a very very different and wonderful experience than digital. Especially slide film. It&#8217;s unique in that you have such a sense of finality with each click of the shutter. You are absolutely done in your part of the image making process. This is a very different psychological exercise than say shooting black and white film or digital. Of course you &#8220;could&#8221; post process it but for the vast majority of my life in film that was just not done for anything but commercial photography. Even when it was done it was someone else&#8217;s job. You as the photographer were done and you lived with that version of your image. Any post processing was merely a tear sheet based on that image but it was NOT the image.</p>

<p>Enjoy (or not) I love how juicy Kodachrome is right out of the camera (the actual slides look better) - these happened to be mounted so I left the border. All K64 (PKR) although I loved PKL as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, I am helping a photographer friend with an installation of his prints. It&#8217;s not a gallery, not a show, but a commercial installation in a high-end restaurant. Most of the installation is in close quarters and requires nothing but &#8220;normal&#8221; sized prints. The typical 16&#8221;x24&#8221; and 20&#8221;x30&#8221;. Now to me these are BIG prints. In most circumstances I would not make something bigger than this as art just out of my own personal sense of taste and context.</p>

<p>You have probably figured this out by now but I am not a fan of images that scream at you and then pound you over the head, and then add insult to injury by not letting you run away because they are so looming and large you have to cross some international border before they disappear over the horizon. In other words - images that are big just to be big. For my aesthetic - giant billboard sized photographs have no place as art. They are what they are - advertisements, advertisements are supposed to beat you over the head and MAKE you look at them in whatever way possible.</p>

<p>That brings us to the very large dining room and a particular wall that is not really close to anything or anyone that he needs to fill. We tried a few 20&#8221;x30&#8221; prints. To tell you the truth, they were lost in a sea of dark umber paint. What now? Believe it or not it was my idea to go big - really really big. How does 5 FEET by 8 FEET sound? Personally I have no experience producing an art image this big. I do have some experience producing commercial images of this scale and I know what I don&#8217;t like about them. I am going to try to keep the scale and avoid what I don&#8217;t like. Part of what I don&#8217;t like about oversized images is that in the commercial world all subtlety goes right out the window and it is more of an exercise in pure graphic art. Take a look at those larger than life fashion images in the store windows, the images of the coke can on the front of the machine, etc, etc.</p>

<p>Before investing in this epic print (extremely expensive depending on materials = checkout Duggal or Aluminarte), we decided to to a mockup using some generic HP photo paper that both of us have a dislike for and this seemed like a perfect way to get rid of it.</p>

<p>Here is <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/">Les</a> assembling the mockup so that we can get a sense of scale in the actual location as well as assess the possibility that we can get the art to hold up at that size.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/P1000958.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/P1000958.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>Here is a really crappy image in the darkness that shows you kind how big it will be.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/P1000963-Version-2.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/P1000963-Version-2.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>Les and I decide that the giant print is a go. We are making some final decisions on the material, the presentation, and of course the actual image to be used as there are a few candidates. I have no doubt that this is doable from a really good 12 Megapixel image - by really good I mean perfect. There are a few aesthetic decisions that I am wrestling with, the biggest one is grain simulation as these are digital RAW files as source images.</p>

<p>Here is my rationale - I like grain, at least some of it. I hate digital noise. When you go this big on an image there are areas in the image that are totally smooth with no gradation and no detail to lock onto. That is just a fact when doing this kind of enlargement from an original that only has 12 million dots and started out as 24mmx36mm. I am scared that if I don&#8217;t introduce simulated film grain that it will look a whole lot like the side of a coke machine. On the other hand I am equally scared that the vast public out there who&#8217;s eyeballs have been conditioned to this no-detail no-gradation ultra smoooooooth digital assault will find any hint of &#8220;grain/noise&#8221; objectionable.</p>

<p>Any opinions out there?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the last few months we have all been hearing about Kodak Kodachrome about thirty two times more frequently than the last 15 years. I guess because this time it&#8217;s really gone. I loved the freaking stuff my self. Of course I had to stop shooting it for &#8220;paid work&#8221; because even clients would spec Fuji. For a lot of my personal shots I used Kodachrome continuously until my color gave way to digital in the early 2000&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Looking over a lot of the photos in the media&#8217;s recent coverage of Kodachrome gets me all weepy. Why oh why did all of us let it die a lingering death. Whoa is me&#8230; Seriously, I forget how freaking good slide film of all types look until I see it again. Screw it I am buying a couple of rolls and shooting it in the M6 or maybe the FM2, or both.</p>

<p>But we all know that we are all far too lazy and too cheap to shoot it all the time. Mostly lazy. If you haven&#8217;t shot it in a while do yourself a favor and blow through a roll. Spend the 20 bucks all in to have it processed and scanned by a great lab. Just do it. If you want to see something sort kinda like slide film (not really but better than nothin&#8217;) <a href="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;bc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;fc1=000000&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;t=rbde-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;m=amazon&amp;f=ifr&amp;md=10FE9736YVPPT7A0FBG2&amp;asins=B00111C6U4">check out Alien Skin Exposure</a>. It&#8217;s not cheap and it&#8217;s not the same but out of the lot it is the closest in my opinion to the real deal.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newsweek.com/photo/2011/01/04/kodachrome.html#">Check this article out</a>. If this doesn&#8217;t want to make you chuck the digital and just go with the simplicity of the shoot it and done of our collective past, I don&#8217;t know what will. This stuff looks fantastic.</p>

<p>Here is an old random PKR (Kodachrome 64) shot that was laying around of nothing special - strait scan with no hocus-pocus. Not even a filter.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/1997004-04.jpg" rel="lightbox">

<p>or maybe this one that was laying here</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>

<p>Ps. I really am going to shoot a roll of slide film, really, I am. Oh and I will do a comparison and review of Alien Skin&#8217;s Exposure while I am at it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the coolest things about maintaining a blog is that out of nowhere ancient posts get resurrected by somebody stumbling upon them and then posting a link somewhere. Of course this can sometimes be embarrassing when you spoke about something you feel differently about now. Sort of like those old 70&#8217;s pictures your mom has of you.</p>

<p>Anyway, when that happens I typically get a lot of emails asking if what I was talking about is still &#8220;true&#8221;. The surprise of the week for me was that <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2010/02/17/beater-camera-follow-up-nikon-d2h-the-beast/">this post on the Nikon D2H</a> was somehow brought back from the dead and has like 150 views in the last day or so. To answer a bunch of questions at once&#8230;</p>

<p>Yes I still feel the same way about the Nikon D2H. It was and is a great camera. Even with all it&#8217;s obsolete tech, this was one of the cameras that defines what makes a camera great. I still endorse getting one - especially as a &#8220;beater camera&#8221;. I am a big advocate of two things that I consider to be great ideas for photographers that don&#8217;t have a bunch of experience with a lot of diverse gear.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Getting a old, cheap, &#8220;pro&#8221; type camera as a beater camera will do two things - teach you not to be so scared with you brand new camera. Don&#8217;t abuse it but for sure USE THE CRAP OUT OF THE THING. Having an old cheap camera will prove to you they are hard to break and get you more comfortable with their expandability in any case. If you still can&#8217;t get over it, at least you will have a camera to use in all those &#8220;dangerous&#8221; situations like near the water.</li>
    <li>Absolutely use this cheap way to determine if the cost of a pro level body will make a difference in your photography or that the latest tech will make a bigger difference - or both. What&#8217;s the difference in the images that pop out of a D90 vs A D300 vs a D3? Not much to be blunt but the handling difference, speed, controls may be make it or break it. Seriously doing this with an old but great pro body might just put you in the market for a used D3 vs waiting for a new D500000002.</li>
</ul>


<p>Every time I revisit the old D2H files I am surprised how good they are. Here is a 100% crop of a D2H file that was a full length shot. Strait out of the camera except for the crop. No crap. I shoot with all settings flat for image controls with the exception of using color mode III every once in a while. If your stuff doesn&#8217;t look at least this good - you probably don&#8217;t really need a new camera.</p>

</a></p>

<p>Two lights for the subject and one for the background that you can&#8217;t see in this shot.</p>

<p>To answer another question - yes I still do workshops but don&#8217;t really advertise them any more. I sort of do them on the fly with small groups of people that have the interest. I charge only what it takes to cover costs for the most part. If you are interested just ask and I will keep you up to date on when/where.</p>

</a>It&#8217;s been a while since I started down the road with my small camera quest. First it was the Olympus E-P1, next came the Panasonic GF-1, the latest acquisition was the Panasonic LX-5. I like all of these cameras. Of course 3 is way way too many little cameras. On second thought maybe it&#8217;s not but more on that another day.</p>

<p>I figured that it was time to reassess now that the GF-2 is sort of here, or at least on it&#8217;s way to general availability. Based on everything I know about the new GF-2, I don&#8217;t want it. I&#8217;ll stick with the GF-1 but that&#8217;s not the whole story. I really really do like the GF-1 and I also like the one and only lens I own for that camera as well. The 20mm f1.7. The real story is that I do not use it nearly as often as I originally envisioned.</p>

<p>You can probably guess the reason for this. It&#8217;s the LX-5&#8217;s fault. I bought this little tiny camera on a lark. It was expensive back in August of last year but the prices have come down a lot. I would buy it again in a heartbeat. The sole reason I don&#8217;t carry the GF-1 everywhere is because the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dpanasonic%2520lx5%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">LX-5 is sooooooo good</a>. The lens is great, the color is great, the RAW files are actually useful, not that I really need them much. The bonus is that it&#8217;s so stinking small and the lens really does cover 99% of my needs at 24-90 35mm equiv. Add on to that reasonable high ISO, reasonably fast maximum aperture (f2.0 at 24mm) and really really good image stabilization (actually unbelievable). Sprinkle in some convenient controls like AE lock, spot metering, innovative aspect ratio options, super close focus - my other cameras are feeling really really neglected.</p>

<p>Neglected so much so that I am going to have to force myself to carry the GF-1 around for a week. I will have to hide the LX-5 or I will automatically grab it as has been the case for months now. Have you guys played with the newer breed small cameras lately? I am telling you the S95, LX-5, etc. are a whole different ball game than mini-cams of a few years ago.</p>

</a>I suffer some some really strange and horrible afflictions. The first of which is that winter time depresses me. I hate everything about it. I hate the way it looks, I hate the way if feels. I don&#8217;t like the angle of the sun. I don&#8217;t like the short days. I don&#8217;t even like the names of the months in the Northern hemisphere. Last year I tried a to do a wintertime project on trees. I made some decent shots. I did it on film. I made some progress but honestly I was so lazy I never finished. Did I continue it this year - No.</p>

<p>That brings me to my second affliction. Personal projects. I cannot seem to ever finish any personal project. As I think about it, I have never ever, never finished a project I would classify as &#8220;personal&#8221;. Now, this could be considered normal. In fact most humans are very bad at the whole concept of a &#8220;project&#8221;. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, most people are good at at least one kind of &#8220;task&#8221;. A task is not a project, not even close. In fact in my experience most people really prefer dealing with tasks that somebody else defines as clearly as possible. So the fact that I can finish &#8220;tasks&#8221; but not &#8220;projects&#8221; is not surprising except for the fact that I am among the worlds greatest project managers - FOR OTHER PEOPLE&#8217;S PROJECTS. I have a talent for it. I could read you off a litany of proof and qualifications. Nothing can stop me from getting to the end. So how come I cant do my own?</p>

<p>I have narrowed it down to a scope control issue. In my professional life I am ruthless with requirements, scope management, and change control. I guess that&#8217;s why I can be a successful &#8220;pro&#8221; photographer, software development executive, operations manager, etc. Now here is the affliction part - I don&#8217;t like to be that way. That&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t do it 24x7 any more. That&#8217;s one of the things I actually like about my personal photographic endeavors I like that I can meander and change my mind about all things image related and start over with nobody giving a crap. Unfortunately that means none of my &#8220;personal projects&#8221; ever get done. I have projects that have been going on 10 years running. I re-invent them, re-shoot them, re-think them. forget about them, get re-interested in them, but ultimately they languish in limbo land forever. Some on real paper, some on my hard drive.</p>

<p>So, what is this affliction? My diagnosis is complete and utter lack of something called balance. No balance of creative meandering and discipline. It&#8217;s one or the other, I cannot seem to achieve both. It&#8217;s either that or&#8230; it&#8217;s some sort of strange thing where I can get done if it&#8217;s not &#8220;mine&#8221; - some strange rationalization that I am shooting for &#8220;perfection&#8221; that will never be? Or is that a rationalization in and of itself?</p>

<p>Here is a question for all of you photographers out there. How good are you at finishing personal projects? What&#8217;s your affliction? Right now my excuse is winter. Speaking of winter&#8230; I cannot believe <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/">this guy is going to the arctic in the wintertime!</a> If you are cold weather photography lunatic like him you may want to follow his latest endeavor that starts in like a week.</p>
