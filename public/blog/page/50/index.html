The latest greatest version is now 2.1.3. I have read a couple of reports that this actually does fix some esoteric issues that some people have been searching for a solution to for quite some time. That is the good news, the bad news is holy crap Apple - can you possibly muster a 2.2 or something that has just a tidbit or two for the Aperture faithful. I want camera profiles like the ACR users have. Maybe a way to drag more than one project around, something, anything. Ah well, I guess I will just amuse myself with the anecdotal &#8220;I upgraded and it broke all my stuff&#8221; stories that will flood the support boards for the next month or so.</div>

<p>I am a little punch drunk from spending far too much time on reinventing the site with a bunch of new features so I thought I would take a little break and discuss a couple of products that serve as partial alternatives to the heavy hitters in the image work-flow field. The two players that come to mind would be Photo Mechanic and ACDSee Pro.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t claim to be remotely proficient with either product in the way that I am with Aperture and Lightroom but I thought I would bring </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just wanted to let everyone know that I have been hard at work revamping the site using a completely different set of technology. While I do like Wordpress as a simple platform for publishing a blog, it is not at all a viable platform for implementing anything complex. While there are plug-ins that do just about everything and the source is available to hack it to death, I would rather start with something that had the features I have in mind. A number of readers have requested that I add features and functionality to the site (esp. our good buddy Micheal) that would take far too much hacking and then not be very good at the end of it all.</p>

<p>To this end I have been working on a new site that will allow virtually unlimited growth in terms ofÂ functionality, content, users, and contributors using a full-blown CMS (content management system). Since this is free, I do it by myself in my spare time, and I happen to be a big fan of open source I settled on using Drupal as the core architecture. </div>

For the most part I have been trying to keep up with the idiotically increased email flow on various topics regarding subject matter from help with specific work-flow issues, clarifications on articles that obviously needed some clarification, to proving that I am not blind based on some recommendations regarding NEF processing in Aperture that I posted a while ago. No I am not blind, yes I can see the difference between NX2 and my suggestions, my question is why do you assume NX2 is &#8220;correct&#8221; or &#8220;better&#8221;?</p>

<p>Anyway - I have spent a bunch of time trying to help folks with all kinds of issues - doing my best - only one guy. </div>

<p>There has been a ton of talk about the Nikon D3x of late. Like how expensive it is - who the hell do those Nikon people think they are charging eight freaking thousand dollars for a camera? - and such. Well I guess they think they are sort of like one of those Canon 1Ds guys or maybe a little bit less than those Phase One dudes or dudettes but a whole lot less than the mighty leaf people.</p>

<p>I find it hilarious that most folk even comment on this. Especially those that have never shot 4x5 or larger film. Now that is expensive to do it justice and not just shoot it willy nilly and produce random crap in the name of &#8220;art&#8221;. What is even more laughable is those that spend a ton on lenses and bodies that then spend copious time in PS to get rid of the detail they so cherish in just such a special way.</div>

If you have more than a couple of images Aperture&#8217;s search tools are a god send. One of the concepts that I mentioned briefly in the File Management post was that you could use any criteria that you would like to create a selection to subsequently use to &#8220;relocate masters&#8221;. One of the things that I did not mention is some searchable metadata buried in Aperture&#8217;s search HUD that comes in very handy when organizing a complex storage scheme.</div>

As everyone probably knows lift allows you to lift adjustments and metadata from one image and then stamp it to one or more images that you select after doing the &#8220;lift&#8221;. I thought a brief discussion on some of the more subtle behaviors of this tool might be valuable if you haven&#8217;t yet explored beyond and all or nothing approach to lifting and stamping.</p>

<p>First off realize that you do not have to take everything you lifted and stamp it wholesale to other images. What is pretty obvious is that you can uncheck the little boxes all the way at the left of the lift and stamp HUD. </div>

For the first time ever the email volume of questions, suggestions, requests, and reprisals has outstripped my capacity to answer them in a timely manner. What shall I do, I guess I will work hard this weekend to get through them.</p>

<p>I thought work-flow and organization and efficiency was a boring topic. I thought that simple things were simple. I tried to stay away from the &#8220;how to make a flat image pop&#8221; but here in the back corner of the internet there does seem to be a couple of people that are interested in such boring topics.</div>

The best news it&#8217;s free. Farily similar to the free version of the Flickr upload plugin for Aperture. Without further adieu the download is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/aperture-picasa-plugin/downloads/list">here</a> I cannot really vouch for it&#8217;s flexibility or utility as I have not had much experience with it yet. I believe it came into existance about two days ago and I have just downloaded it and played with it today.</p>

<p>Enjoy - would love hear if you picasa users find it useful and better yet how it compares to the not free version that has been out there from Ubermind for those of you that own that product.</p>

I hope to shed some light on the topic for new users and maybe show some old dogs a couple of new tricks in the file management department. Starting at the beginning Aperture allows you to choose two different approaches to managing your original image files. The first way is called &#8220;managed&#8221; masters. If you choose to use &#8220;managed&#8221; masters Aperture will automatically copy all of your original images from their import location into it&#8217;s own library, you don&#8217;t have to worry about a thing. For some reason this scares people and makes them very uncomfortable. I have no idea why. The Aperture library is just a folder with an attribute that tells the finder not to let you see inside and accidentally screw it up with out doing something really special and complicated (right clicking). </div>
