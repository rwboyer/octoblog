  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you visit the Apple Aperture support forum you may have noticed a couple of long running threads regarding an issue with the Aperture sharpening quick brush. The angry mob believes that there is an issue where this brushed in sharpening is not being exported. Over the last two weeks I have worked with more than a few people that thought they were experiencing this &#8220;issue&#8221;. Here are my findings.</p>

<p>First off - I do not want to claim that this is the end all be all answer to this but I am willing to publish it based on every single case that I have looked into turned out the same and I see the same thing on all of my own Aperture 3 installations. If you are experiencing something different than I describe please do not hesitate to contact me via email - I would love to get to the bottom of this. So far the bottom line is - Aperture is not guilty, the brushed in sharpening is being exported exactly like it appears within Aperture - with one caveat - when viewing the suspect image at reduced size within Aperture vs say Preview the effect is exaggerated. Here is what you can do to show this clearly.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Brush in your sharpening and view it at 100%</li>
    <li>Export that image as a full size tiff (just to eliminate JPEG compression but it doesn&#8217;t really matter)</li>
    <li>Open the exported image in preview and view at actual size (command - zero)</li>
    <li>Look at them side by side both at 100%</li>
</ul>


<p>In every case doing this has shown identical results The sharpening is present and identical in both images- the &#8220;issue&#8221; comes in when you view the images at a reduced size to fit on the screen. When you do this the reduced image within Aperture shows the sharpening much more clearly than Preview. Why is this? most certainly it is due to the resizing method used - what is broken? In my opinion nothing. This kind of thing has always been the case when smashing down a big image to view on screen - different software will produce different results.</p>

<p>Again I would love to see a case where the brushed sharpening is actually not being exported.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Remember our ongoing conversations about Aperture support forums? Thought all of you may get a laugh out of this one.</p>

<p><a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2499932&amp;tstart=0">&#8220;Where the hell are the file names - Aperture Sucks!&#8221;</a></p>

<p>As the adventure loving type I just had to chime in on this one and see if it leads to where I predicted. Yes I may be a little manipulative in shoving it in that direction but I am hoping to get a human nature surprise and have it go the other direction.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Ap3labels.jpg"><img title="Ap3labels.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/.thumbs/.Ap3labels.jpg" border="0" alt="Ap3labels.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="94" align="left" /></a>There were three things on the enormous Aperture 3 feature list that caused me some excitement at first glance. they are probably not what you are thinking, they were color labels along with the ability to read and write IPTC metadata to image masters. This probably does not sound too too exciting but for me it was, and it should have been to a lot of others.</p>

<p>After using Aperture 3 for quite some time, actually almost immediately my excitement waned somewhat. It is sort of a glass is half full, half empty sort of thing depending on what day it is. I have lived so long without color labels in Aperture that I found them completely unnecessary at this point because there are so many other, possibly superior, ways to control your work-flow (like albums). The reason for my initial excitement was that I envisioned using color labels as a simple and efficient way to provide communication across the many tools that access my RAW master files. That is the only reason I could think of to actually use them - as a signaling device that is shared among software that accesses my masters - that&#8217;s it. Honestly I can live without them in the context of Aperture alone.</p>

<p>Alas the one thing that I found them useful for does not work due to the continuing ridiculous split personality that Aperture 3 exhibits. The split personality that I am referring to is that all of the bits and pieces that are there to suggest that it is useful as a universal tool to coordinate a broadly diverse work-flow that plays well with others. The harsh reality is that it goes 80% of the way there but for reasons that I cannot fathom in my wildest hallucinations leaves out what seem to be small but absolutely critical details.</p>

<p>Okay we have core IPTC supported, we have read/write IPTC sync capabilities with our masters from Aperture, we have color labels. Oooops  we forgot one thing - they are on the list of things that DO NOT get written out as part of the sync with the master files - along with rating. What the F&#8230;? We&#8217;ll why the hell not? We&#8217;ll that&#8217;s okay - we&#8217;ll just make it so we don&#8217;t read labels or ratings from masters either - there we go - all fixed up. Again WTF?</p>

<p>The same kind of thing goes for other data elements as well, along with the seemingly &#8220;can&#8217;t get there from here&#8221; behavior with XMP sidecars. Yep you can write them any time you want but&#8230; you can only read them at initial import - that&#8217;s it. I guess that is an improvement from not reading them at all in Aperture 2 but again - why the F..K not? Why oh why oh why may I ask put in the vast majority of the effort to make multi-product integration via metadata a reality and then stop at the last tiny little bit to make it useful? This has continuously caused me to invent and implement bizarre manual rituals to implement my ethnically diverse products into a cohesive whole sharing my RAW masters.</p>

<p>Just so all of you new readers don&#8217;t think I have all of a sudden turned into an Aperture basher (I have always been a bitter critic of Aperture&#8217;s shortcomings, there is some good news on this front. The IPTC data synchronization that is there performs brilliantly. Especially compared to the truly bizarre behavior of Aperture 2 (where any tiny little master file change had the more infuriating habit of completely decimating EVERYTHING you did in Aperture without warning or notice - even some Aperture plug-ins caused this). The new behavior, which is largely automagic, does an incredibly brilliant job merging metadata in Aperture - even if it was not previously synchronized to the master file. I actually use this to overcome a bizarre decision by the Aperture team to provide no option to deal with embedding the keyword hierarchy.</p>

<p>No product is perfect - heck Adobe can&#8217;t even make bridge play well with Lightroom - it has unexplainable quirkiness and a complete lack of options regarding XMP sidecar vs embedded metadata as well as truly bizarre behavior when there are both present but at least you can figure out a some sort of work-flow with the features it does provide. Maybe it&#8217;s just me but due to the lack of ability to communicate color labels outside of Aperture via the way EVERYTHING else in the photographic universe works, I have subconsciously boycotted their use within Aperture. Has anyone found a fantastically good use for them that is not already solved by other long existing Aperture features?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/DSC_1103___Version_2.jpg"><img title="DSC_1103___Version_2.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/.thumbs/.DSC_1103___Version_2.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_1103___Version_2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="101" height="150" align="left" /></a>It has been about a week since I released the Aperture 3 update of my file management eBook. I have been overwhelmed at the response of people that already purchased the last version that have upgraded to the new version for the low low price of a buck. Some of you that got the upgrade offer have actually paid the full price on purpose - for no good reason except generosity. I wanted to write a quick note to thank everyone for their continued support that bothered to upgrade.</p>

<p>What was completely unexpected is that about 72% of people that got the upgrade email purchased the upgrade. Wow, I was expecting more like 10%. The rationale for my upgrade price was to be fair to everyone that purchased the book in the past. Most of the updates were &#8220;pretty much same church - different pew&#8221; with a couple of new things based on change functionality. I figured that I priced the first one way way too low and also figured everyone should end up paying the same amount for the new one, no matter when it was purchased.</p>

<p>The other thing that I found strange was that I have received very little feedback (good or bad) regarding the new version - I received plenty of feedback about the upgrade price - overwhelmingly positive - with ONE bit of strange feedback that I will not bother to repeat because I truly didn&#8217;t understand it. Something about upgrading a different eBook that was not purchased for the upgrade price of a buck or something like that. Oh well. I hope to get some feedback (good or bad) sooner or later.</p>

<p>On another note - I will be releasing the new version of the organization and work-flow eBook soon and have been thinking a lot about how to deal with that one. The option that keeps floating to the top is this:</p>

<p>A tiered upgrade offer - simple but tiered. One upgrade price (cheap) for those that EVER purchased the Aperture 2 version and another price for those that purchased the old version after Aperture 3&#8217;s release (even cheaper). My rationale for this is that there is a lot more new content (vs just revised) for things that did not exist at all. I think I am going to go with this unless there is an outcry of &#8220;go stuff yourself&#8221; - in which case I will put some more thought process to it.</p>

<p>Again</p>

<p>Sincere thank you for all of you that have upgraded - the support is appreciated.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I ran across this from a tweet from one of the very few people I follow on twitter. I am not much of a &#8220;twitterer&#8221;. I rarely post anything and definitely don&#8217;t spend my life recording what inane things I happen to be doing, which appears to be - mostly twittering for twitterers. Reminds me too much of phone conversations I overhear my teenage daughters having - &#8220;What are you doin&#8217; - nothin&#8217;, what are you doin&#8217;, oh - nothin&#8217;, I&#8217;m bored - me too, what do you want to do - nothin&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Back on topic - I do not jest when I say that capabilities and pace of technology is beyond the ability of human beings to really grasp. Even the most open minded, tech savvy, ex-technology guys that went to school for physics, math, and comp sci really don&#8217;t quite &#8220;grasp&#8221; the pace - we can rationalize and put things into quantities and words but that is not what I am talking about. I am talking about the metric system effect - I know the metric system - heck I wasn&#8217;t allowed to use non-SI units in any professional endeavor or in any classroom - EVER. The fact is I live and grew up in the USA - therefore my head works in miles, feet, yards, gallons, MPH, etc. In other words I do not think in system Internationale .</p>

<p>How many people that use and depend on computer technology really grasp how the landscape has changed so dramatically it is like another world since the not so long ago &#8220;open/free/gnu&#8221; software movement? Being human beings all of us are subject to this in ability to fully grasp the rate of change, even if we can intellectually &#8220;understand&#8221; it. This is not limited to &#8220;old people&#8221; - the rate of &#8220;everything that used to be known truths is now wrong&#8221; affects everybody.</p>

<p>Here is something that sort of drives that point home - not in a trivial way but in a more profound way. It isn&#8217;t just the iPhone4 - it is the fact that it is being compared to something that was only mind blowing like yesterday. It is also profound in what it is NOT being compared to.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/GLMedia_491.jpg"><img title="GLMedia_491.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/.thumbs/.GLMedia_491.jpg" border="0" alt="GLMedia_491.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="120" height="150" align="left" /></a>Wooooo hoooooooo, heeeeeee haaaa. Finally I am finished the updates for the definitive guide to Aperture 3 file management. Sorry for how long it took, I thought that it would be easy but I was wrong. I told you about my little bout with the dreaded spring fever but that&#8217;s not the whole story. Not only my perennial distraction caused by the mix of warm weather, blue sky, water, pollen, flowers, etc. caused the lethargic release of the update. It was also a matter of how much work that I did not expect to do. Yea Aperture 3 works the same way Aperture 2 did - except for a lot of subtle differences. I took them in stride while using Aperture 3, quite naturally as a long time Aperture devotee but when it came to writing them down. That&#8217;s another matter altogether.</p>

<p>The Aperture 2 guide to file management started out at 11,000 words. It&#8217;s now almost 19,000 words for Aperture 3. There is almost nothing that did not require revision - either due to changes and new features in Aperture 3 or because I wanted to add some things here and there or to explain a few things just a little bit better. I expected a light touch up - I was wrong. Don&#8217;t worry - if you have this stuff down pat there are no earth shattering new revelations but I do go into a bit of a discussion on multiple libraries, RAW+JPEG, and some other minor stuff that was not in the Aperture 2 version of the eBook.</p>

<p>So how do you get it? Well it is right <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/aperture-ebooks/">here on the Aperture eBooks page</a>. The old version is no longer available - it is now a collectors item (or not). If you really want the old version shoot me an email. But wait - what&#8217;s this? The stinking price went up by a whole dollar - what the F?</p>

<p>After reading the drivel that is pumped out on all subjects digital photography and Aperture within days of it&#8217;s release I figured I could get away with adding a buck to the price. It still is the best value available for any eBook on any subject in the universe. The truth is I did it to be fair to all of the people buying the old version since the release of Aperture 3. Here is the deal - if you want the new version and never got the old version it is now costs a whole dollar more. You can grab it as of right &#8230;. Now.</p>

<p>If you already bought the the old version, ever, yesterday or two years ago you will be getting an email from me shortly that contains a way to get the new version for&#8230; wait&#8230; here it comes&#8230; ONE DOLLAR. Everyone ends up paying the same price no matter when they bought it. The only way to get it for a buck is via the email. Give it a day or so - if you don&#8217;t get one of the special coupons just email me but it must be with the email that you used for your original paypal payment for the old eBook.</p>

<p>Ps. I do my best but I am sure there are some errors, even though I go through and actually test everything exactly as I have written it. I would be forever grateful for those that point them out. I will correct the errors/omissions and send you a new copy as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have big hopes for the iPad. I really do. I will tell you one thing - it is fantastic for web/audio/video content consumption - eBooks? we&#8217;ll see. I just am not attuned to the eBook consumption on the iPad yet. Love it for reference PDF&#8217;s but not long format word for word reading of 1000&#8217;s of pages. I am not there yet.</p>

<p>I am still waiting for someone to deliver the killer app for us photo guys. I am sort of stunned that we&#8217;ll have iMovie for the iPhone before, apparently, a really killer app for photographers. I am thinking sort of a Nikon Camera Control Pro combined with Aperture-lite with fantastic online/web/social media/blog/journalism integration features. And give me control over a dozen cameras as well, with real time live view. I am feeling it - I just cannot believe it&#8217;s not here.</p>

<p>Heck I know Objective-C, maybe I&#8217;ll have to do it myself - but with my luck the moment I get something even test ready - blam - Apple and it&#8217;s considerable development resource will put it out there with a couple things I haven&#8217;t thought of for $2.99.</p>

<p>Anyone out here using his/her shiny new iPad with their camera? Did I miss the boat? Yea I know about OnOne DSLR remote - it&#8217;s okay but certainly not the killer iPad app. Anyone using that or something else to get real work done in the field?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/DSC_0315___Version_2.jpg"><img title="DSC_0315___Version_2.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/.thumbs/.DSC_0315___Version_2.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_0315___Version_2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="64" align="left" /></a>Forgive me for not updating the site in what seems like a decade. I would love to say that I have been hard at work on finishing up the Aperture 3 updates to my eBooks or producing a gaggle of Aperture 3 screencasts that are better and more reasonably priced than my more capitalistic colleagues but the fact is that I have been suffering from spring fever. Happens every year. I hope to be over it soon. On that note I have been at least jotting down all of the things that cross my mind to post regarding Aperture, photography, etc. What is it they say about &#8220;The faintest ink&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>I was going to write a really insightful but non-exciting soliloquy  about all of the wonderful new Adobe stuff like CS5 and LR3 but to tell you the truth I am not that excited about it. Don&#8217;t get me wrong I will eventually upgrade to CS5 just for the 64bit-ness. Instead I am going to write a little about inspiration. Again. Not for the purpose of inspiring you with my thoughts and experiences but more to help fellow photographers to find there own method. Yes - method. That might seem a little bit contrary to the whole notion of inspiration and it sort of is but  if you are going to be successful in your own artistic endeavors you are going to need a process.</p>

<p>Instead of trying to express some detailed complete and holistic recipe I&#8217;ll just share some snippets of things I do - religiously - and where they lead me. I&#8217;ll try to keep this short but with enough of my own thought process so that hopefully it will be a little more than the bottom line of &#8220;write your ideas and inspirations down&#8221; - always, without fail and do it immediately. Everyone knows this, right? Why do so few people do it? My guess is that they feel either stupid doing it, the particular emotion, feeling, etc has nothing to do with the particular thing they are working on or thinking about right now, or they don&#8217;t think it is useful. Trust me, even if 80% turns out to be useless. The 20% will be useful. If not now, it will be down the road, even if only to lead you somewhere else in your thinking. Write down anything, just a few words will do, reflect on it a little the next day, write down some more if something crosses your mind. It doesn&#8217;t have to stand on it&#8217;s own, it doesn&#8217;t have to be anything. It can be sterile and boring or poetic. Doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>

<p>The other night I was outside at about 10pm and got a surge of electricity, pangs of anxiety. Not the bad kind - the good kind. The rock star taking the stage kind with all the associated adrenaline fueled restlessness that comes with it. Why? The endless promise and possibilities of a new summer. So what did I write down? Embarrassingly enough - just a couple of words and phrases describing my surroundings - the things my physical senses told me about.</p>

<p>&#8220;Blue velvet sky with countless stars&#8221;, &#8220;soft silvery moonlight&#8221;, &#8220;fireflies&#8221;, &#8220;smell of honeysuckle&#8221;, &#8220;music&#8221;, &#8220;laughter of post adolescent teenage girls&#8221;, &#8220;warm glow of lights through open windows&#8221;. That&#8217;s it. The next day I read those things and thought a little bit about why those things exerted such power on me. Guess what all of a sudden a late teenage summer tradition hit me like a train. I wrote it all down, everything I could think of. To spare you the recitation of the semi-coherent short story that was the final result of my scribblings I&#8217;ll just summarize the event that I wrote down.</p>

<p>In the way back time in the area I grew up in, a well-to-do, very republican suburb most parents and younger siblings would disappear for large portions of the summer. Right down the road from me in a place called Rose Tree there were two sisters about my age that would have parties at least once a week. Dozens of girls from the all girls prep school that they attended and boys from all over the place. The road they lived on was wooded and infested with honeysuckle - so powerful you could hardly breath. They lived in a stone english manor style house typical for the neighborhood with a long stone drive lined with ancient elm trees and rose gardens. Walking down the drive towards the house you could hear the music coming from the patio on the back lawn and see a few of the people spilling out the sides. Over the music and chatter you could hear the song of young women&#8217;s laughter. The only light was that from the interior spilling out through the open windows and the moon on perfect - clear June nights. Hell I even wrote about how the giant weeping willow tree down by the stream at the back of the lawn looked and sounded.</p>

<p>I left out all of my feeble attempts to capture how that makes me feel, or things I remember saying to my friends walking up that drive with me on various occasions but I wrote them down anyway. Why? Am I working on some sort of summer image project? Nope but&#8230; I can personally pull about 100 image ideas directly from those memories and 1000 more ideas from my memories of how people looked, expressions, gestures, relationships, etc., etc. If not next week then a year from now. I have no idea where or what will become of the 15minutes I spent writing all of it down. The 30 seconds when it hit me or the balance when reflecting on it. Based on previous experience the absolute least it will do is paint me a picture on demand for anything related so that I can use it to inspire gesture or expression, the most it will do is give me a direct narrative for something I actually produce.</p>

<p>I hope that all of that was not a complete waste of time. I thought some of you t just starting to develop your own creative process will get some insight into a small part of mine. The bottom line that I mentioned at the beginning about writing everything down is on point, ideas, circumstances, memories, triggers, details - they all matter when producing a narrative of any type. Maybe more importantly is trying to grasp at the essence of things that evoke a strong reaction in you. You will forget the nuances if you don&#8217;t process them and the nuances and subtleties are what it is all about.</p>

<p>More later.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/144a9ky.jpg"><img title="144a9ky.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/.thumbs/.144a9ky.jpg" border="0" alt="144a9ky.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="50" align="left" /></a>Hope all of you have a fantastic weekend. I certainly plan on it. I am actually going to shoot some images this weekend. Maybe even of a guitar. Maybe even work it into a screencast work-flow lesson for Aperture 3 next week. I am feeling quite energetic. If you are not shooting enough (happens to me a lot) what gets you motivated to shoot?</p>

<p>For me most of the time it is something internal in my brain that goes click. Part of my bipolar nature I guess. Sometimes it is something external, some sort of outside motivation. I have been thinking for a while about what I could do to provide some outside influence or motivation to others out there to shoot more. A week or so ago I decided to shoot at least one decent image of a guitar. I personally have never taken a good one and most I see do not capture the essence of the object. It is harder than you might think. For whatever reason this got me motivated to shoot gaggles of images last week. No good ones but at least I am making progress on it and they started to evolve - environmental factors seem to be key in what I am trying to do with these images. Little tiny snippets of ambient surroundings that give a feel that I want. That and obviously the right composition and angles and light on the subject itself.</p>

<p>To connect the two ideas I was thinking&#8230; Do you have hobbies/interests that you don&#8217;t try to capture the essence of with your photography? Maybe because it is to &#8220;intellectual&#8221;, &#8220;cerebral&#8221;, &#8220;conceptual&#8221;, just plain difficult to do? If so how about a little mini online exposition of readers photographs of their hobbies/endeavors that ARE NOT the only subject matter they shoot - but more of the ones that they DON&#8217;T. Example - if you love camping and the outdoors - NO LANDSCAPES, how about your fishing rods instead if you like fishing. Something like that. I&#8217;ll host it and if we have a dozen or so people that want to participate it will be fun and educational in a lot of ways to each other but more importantly to yourself.</p>

<p>Any takers? Maybe we will make it some sort of contest with a prize based on votes or something?</p>

<p>On another note, I know that all of you are not musicians but a heck of a lot of you are here is a great example of why us whacked out guitarists routinely do not use traditional musical notation - it can be worse that useless in some cases. Personally I am not a good sight reader but I am educated and assure you this is quite accurate (well sort of - missing all the really important stuff like nuance and HOW that makes it what it is). A special prize goes to the first one to figure out what song is at the top of the post is the very first part of the intro to.</p>

<p>TGIF</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. For the not so musically inclined - you are not left out. Today is stupid subconscious pun day. There are three of them in this post. Special prize if you caught them.</p>
