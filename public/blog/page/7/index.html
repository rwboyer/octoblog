  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have received a couple of emails from new-ish Nikon users that had some questions about using older lenses. Here is RB&#8217;s quick and dirty guide to using older lenses on newer cameras. Beware this is focused more towards the pro end of the camera spectrum rather than the inexpensive new Nikon DSLR&#8217;s that only accept G type lenses without an Aperture ring. Assuming that your camera can mount lenses other than the brand new G lenses there is one key difference that you need to be aware of. This is an AI type lens vs a Non-AI type lens.</p>

<p>So, what&#8217;s this AI/Non-AI thing all about anyway???</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;P1010898&#8221; size=&#8221;full&#8221; id=&#8221;3184&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>Take a look at the ring right behind the lens mount/body cap. See the little finger or prong sticking up? Â This is the AI prong. This one happens to be flipped up and out of the way so that you can mount a &#8220;Non-AI&#8221; old lens on the body. When flipped down it&#8217;s for mounting AI lenses and serves tells the in-camera meter what Aperture the lens is set to. When flipped down it&#8217;s in the way so you cannot mount a Non-AI lens. See the small silver button to the right of the finger/lever/prong - press it down to flip up the prong. If your camera has an AI ring that looks like this it can pretty much mount any lens. Too bad all digital bodies that have an AI ring/prong at all cannot flip them out of the way so you <a href="http://www.aiconversions.com/compatibilitytable.htm">MUST get your lens converted to AI - this guy does it for like 20 bucks or something cheap.</a></p>

<p>Moving on to lenses, If your lens looks like this - even the all black ones - it is a Non-AI lens unless it&#8217;s already been converted.</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;P1010902&#8221; size=&#8221;full&#8221; id=&#8221;3183&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>Here is what the Aperture ring looks like - it&#8217;s a solid piece that extends all the way back.</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;P1010903&#8221; size=&#8221;full&#8221; id=&#8221;3187&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>If you have a lens that looks like the next image&#8230;</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;P1010907&#8221; size=&#8221;full&#8221; id=&#8221;3188&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>or this&#8230;</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;P1010912&#8221; size=&#8221;full&#8221; id=&#8221;3191&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>It could be either an AI or a Non-AI&#8230;. The difference is the Aperture ring. You have already seen the way a Non-AI looks. This is what an AI lens&#8217; Aperture ring looks like&#8230;</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;P1010918&#8221; size=&#8221;full&#8221; id=&#8221;3194&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>The little second set of aperture numbers are a dead giveaway but more important is the cutout and the ridge that engages the AI prong on the camera body. AF lenses have these as well except for the newer G type lenses that have NO aperture ring.</p>

<p>As a note - if you are using a film body that has a flip up AI prong as shown above you have to use &#8220;stop down metering&#8221; This means that you have to press the DOF lever on the camera to stop the lens down to the aperture that it is set to so that you can adjust your shutter speed correctly as the camera will have no idea what aperture the lens is set to without the AI prong engaged that biases the meter to the &#8220;taking aperture&#8221; as the aperture ring is turned.</p>

<p>If anyone is interested how Non-AI metering with a Non-AI body works let me know. If not I&#8217;ll skip it. I am the only one that I know still using a camera with Non-AI style meter (An F2 with DP-1 meter finder).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The mailman came today and it was like christmas. I love this stuff, all for $100 from an eBay auction. If you want to learn a lot about photography, be capable of making extremely good looking images once you do, and you have very very little money this kind of thing is the ticket. Look what $100 buys you&#8230;</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;P1010896&#8221; size=&#8221;full&#8221; id=&#8221;3180&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>I won&#8217;t give the complete list but here are some highlights to give you an idea&#8230;</p>

<ul>
    <li>An almost mint condition Nikon FE in black paint - yep that&#8217;s black paint over enamel - The kind of thing that makes Leica users go temporarily insane and spend $8000 on a very similar device to shoot film with no included lenses.</li>
    <li>A pristine Nikkor 50mm f 1.8 AI lens - yea they are cheap on eBay but they are also very very good at taking nice images.</li>
    <li>A mint condition Nikkor 28mm Non-AI in the all metal variety. Yes it&#8217;s single coated vs NIC but I can tell you from my own experience it works great - in a lot of ways better than the larger aperture lenses and this one is not only perfect but it came with the Nikon supplied case. Yes it works on the FE - almost every lens ever made by Nikon does.</li>
    <li>A good condition Vivitar 85-205mm f 3.5 lens that probably takes pictures that are perfectly fine and feels about twice as good as the plastic crap like this made today.</li>
    <li>A mint condition Tamron SP 90mm f 2.8 macro that has a 9 bladed aperture and probably works great. 90mm f2.8 is a well know quantity virtually all of them are good - this one also happens to focus really really really close. It came with the original box and Tamron case. It&#8217;s AI so easy to work with.</li>
    <li>A flash gun that is not pictured. The manual for the FE, a dozen or so filters all in perfect shape like they have never been used. Some of them very expensive like the Tiffen polarizer, the Nikon ND, a set of Close-up lenses in perfect shape, a teleconverter, and a bunch of other paraphernalia.</li>
</ul>


<p>Heck even if you have loads of cash this is a great way to step out of your norm and make some very different images that you are making with your ultra-zo0m, AF, motor-driven, crop sensored, digi-cam. Everyone talks about how &#8220;The camera doesn&#8217;t matter&#8221;. I am here to tell you that is absolute bullshit. What <em>everyone</em> means is that every camera can take good images as well as bad images but different cameras with different sensor/film sizes with different handling characteristics, focus mechanisms, wind vs. motor, zoom vs fixed focal length, etc, etc, etc will make very different images in the hands of a <em>single photographer</em>. Heck they even influence the subject you point them at very differently.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have mused, explained, communicated - or tried to many times a thought process that I completely understand at a very instinctual level but find it hard to articulate in words with any kind of coherence. Since I know that I am incapable at this point of any kind of clear holistic dissertation on the subject I try my best to infuse a lot of my posts with the <em>feeling</em> of this thought process that I referred to. Let&#8217;s call it a philosophy of the photographic endeavor.</p>

<p>Many times I have mentioned in many different ways that commercial photography work poisoned me, poisoned my outlook, and poisoned my work. Don&#8217;t get me wrong - I did learn a lot about making <em>perfect</em> images. The question is perfect in which particular way. My answer happens to be - in a way that was exactly opposite of what I wanted to see. When I took a semi-permanent vacation from photography of anything it took me a couple of years to really get my head straitened out about the endeavor again. Now that I am a couple of years beyond that I am actually starting to dip my toe in to anything remotely <em>project</em> oriented again - this time my own project - my own way - using media and an approach that I want to use for no particular rationale other than I<strong> want to</strong>.</p>

<p>I have spoken about film more than most would like or are interested in. I have talked about simplicity in approach, equipment, and treatment of images after they have been taken. I know I have not articulated reasons beyond fairly simple logic trying to appeal to your sense of economics, love of beautifully designed devices, and the no-brainer - &#8220;let someone else do the work&#8221; thought process. I have tried to explain the wonderfulness of only caring what the image looks like instead of worrying and fretting over what the noise looks like or what AF mode to choose.</p>

<p>There is way more to it. One of the best articulations of how I feel, where I have been (a different path but same though process), where I might go, what was missing, what happened, why I do what I do now, etc etc - has been t<a href="http://www.smogranch.com/purity/">his short essay by Daniel Milnor</a>. I have talked with dozens of photographers that feel this way. I have talked with dozens of photographers that didn&#8217;t think this way 5 years ago but they do now. Part of the reason that I admire the photographers that I do mention from time to time is that they seemed to get to a place down the road from where I am and so many others are&#8230; The next place in the endeavor where their vision and approach are not at all influenced or polluted by any specific endeavor or why they are performing it. I urge you to read Daniel&#8217;s essay and think about it briefly.</p>

<p>On a similar note take a look at <a href="http://blog.alexwaterhousehayward.com/2011/06/michaels-dream.html">this short photographic series </a>shot in a very simple way using very simple equipment - I don&#8217;t know this photographer other than the images that he presents on his blog but I can reliably predict that he might - just might have been through the same thought process and ended up what he is doing now for similar reasons even if it was a completely different route.</p>

<p>I bring this up today because, as I mentioned yesterday, I have been elected to shoot the communities annual fourth of July event. This is no big deal with no giant expectations but it scares the shit out of me. Not because I can possibly fail but because of the chaos of how to prepare - how to light - how to shoot - what equipment - how to direct. In other words it&#8217;s a project - someone else&#8217;s project that is subconsciously doing the same thing to me and my approach and what <em><strong>I want </strong><span style="font-style: normal;">that other commercial fashion endeavors did to me years ago. It&#8217;s like PTSD of sorts - if I don&#8217;t get myself under control I will be hauling lights around in a truck, finding a new location for the event, and completely recasting it with professional models instead of the people in the community&#8230;. </span></em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yes - I shoot film. I have been winding my way through a few long outdated bricks of Kodak Portra 160 VC. Love that stuff. As luck would have it I blew through my last roll this week and was simultaneously elected the event photographer for my communities Fourth of July celebration. Hmmmm&#8230;</p>

<p>I figured I would head down to the &#8220;local&#8221; &#8220;Pro&#8221; photography shop that is about an hour&#8217;s drive from my house and grab some of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004V3I6JY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004V3I6JY">new Portra films</a> for the event Monday. Guess what happened. They don&#8217;t have it. They have a couple rolls of sorry looking outdated non-pro films but that&#8217;s it. I call around and NOBODY stocks anything I am remotely interested in. Pretty much Fuji - ultra cheapo color neg film only.</p>

<p>I ended up going to Walmart and picked up a 4-pack of el-cheapo buck-a-roll consumer Fuji. Yuk. I have never been enamored with Fuji&#8217;s consumer films. They really haven&#8217;t changed much. I could have lived with the NPS stuff or the 400H but not the crappy consumer stuff. The color is just not my cup of tea. I guess I will plan better. To make sure this doesn&#8217;t happen again I, the moment I got home I ordered the following&#8230;</p>

<ol>
    <li>Two pro-packs of Kodak Portra 160 35mm</li>
    <li>Two pro-packs of Kodak Portra 400 35mm</li>
    <li>Same as number 1 and 2 in 120</li>
    <li>Two discount 5 roll bundles of Kodak Ektar 100 in 35mm</li>
    <li>One 5-pack of Fuji 160S just to compare it to the new Portra 160</li>
</ol>


<p>and since I already had fired up the &#8220;buy now&#8221; clicking muscles in my right index finger I just went ahead and ordered&#8230;.</p>

<ol>
    <li> One near mint black Nikon FM</li>
    <li>One near mint chrome Nikon FM</li>
    <li>Some motor drive coupling covers for my Nikon F3&#8217;s that happened to be missing them.</li>
    <li>A BEAUTIFUL Nikkor 135 f2.0 AIS lens.</li>
    <li>and a partridge in a pear tree.</li>
</ol>


<p>I also added a bunch of bargain film gear to my watch list&#8230; I will let you know if better judgement prevails or I find myself rescuing these beautiful old metal - brass - enamel - and glass beasts from a life of oblivious to bring them into the sun making photographs again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/06/28/new-nikon-digital-camera-annoucement/">I wrote a spoof post announcing a new Nikon DSLR</a> with an image of a Nikon FE and a 60&#8217;s vintage 50mm f 1.4 lens. I wanted it to cost somewhere south of 1000 bucks, have extremely simple controls, and very limited options. All kidding aside - I might buy something like this if the price were right. I definitely know that there would be a substantial number of people that would buy it for $5000 as well. How do I know that? Look at the number of people who buy the $7000-$8000 Leica M9 with about the same set of features. I of course did not. Why should I - I have a couple of M cameras that are perfectly good and continue to use. Do I have the NEED to upload my images the moment they are made? No. Do I like the way various films render color and tone better than digital in a lot of cases? Yes.</p>

<p>I think there are a couple of things to think about regarding the current offerings from camera makers as well as the current state of affairs in image making. Here are some random thoughts for your consumption and comment and the real point of my post yesterday.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Cameras are too complicated. Too many settings to tell the computer inside what you want it to do. The couple of things that really matter should be simple and direct. focus, aperture, and shutter. Are there occasions or subject matter that calls for something else? Maybe but not very many for me. Exposure? Are you kidding me - exposure is EASYÂ there really are not that many circumstances and even the most non-technical photographer can figure it out after a few dozen shots.</li>
    <li>Cameras are too big. Digicams aren&#8217;t but they are not a whole lot smaller than compact 35mm cameras of 2 decades ago. Why are the sensors so stinking small? Why are 25mm sensors accompanied by gigantic camera bodies. Even DX sensors are too small to provoke any kind of DOF rendering with most lenses and they have bodies that are too large for my taste.</li>
    <li>There is a complete lack of diversity in the digital market. For the most part all the cameras are exactly the same, they look the same, they handle the same, they all have the same functions, they all take movies, they are all relatively the same size. etc. etc. There are dozens and dozens of them within the same &#8220;class&#8221; but within that class they are the same. More and more they are even using the same sensor across brands.There are a few exceptions and they sell well - even if they are not perfect. I think one of the reasons they are not superlative is that they are half measures and the committee that designs them gives way to &#8220;more features&#8221; or common wisdom. Take the Fuji X100 - lots of potential but fails. How much better would that camera be if they did away with AF all together and just gave you a smooth accurate manual focus ring and range-finder patch? In my opinion a lot. Same with the Leica X1.</li>
    <li>I love everything about my Leica M cameras, my Nikon F series from the original F through the F3, I love my FM&#8217;s and FE&#8217;s. Heck I even love old Sears/Ricoh RF with fixed 25mm. I don&#8217;t LOVE any of my digicams in close to the same way. They are junk, complicated, take so so images, and far far more importantly they make me think less about the important things and think more about non-sense. In a word - distracting.</li>
    <li>Big, heavy, slow, zoom lenses suck. They are about the only reason I could give a rats ass about ISO higher than 400. They may have impressive pixel peeping credentials but for the most part they have a rendering that looks like dog shit. Not only do they look like dog shit - they all look like the same dog shit. You can tell the difference in rendering between my Old Nikon 50mm lenses from my Leica 50mm from a mile away.</li>
    <li>Digital tries to make everything &#8220;easy&#8221; from shooting action to shooting at night to making movies. Actually none of it is easy no matter what the camera does. It&#8217;s an illusion of convenience. Hey man there is some settings that you can set and everything is a go&#8230; Bullshit. Pile that on to how much more work it is shooting digital and you have to ask yourself why. Every new camera and software release makes it &#8220;easier&#8221; That&#8217;s crap - how about someone that knows what they are doing taking care of all of the post for dirt cheap and you don&#8217;t worry about it? - That&#8217;s film. I guess if you want to insert yourself you can - but you don&#8217;t have to. Shoot the film, drop it off/get it back = done. Don&#8217;t like the look - talk to the lab and tell them what you want your stuff to look like. Still want to fine tune it - shoot a different film. How great is that.</li>
    <li>I don&#8217;t even own a full frame FX DSLR any more. Gone. Do I miss them - NO. Too big, too complicated and for the most part they make the same images only not as good in some cases as my gorgeous, tiny, Nikon FM or my Leica M6, except I don&#8217;t want to carry them with me. Would I really want a D3 with 24-70 2.8 more than one of my compact film cameras with a 50 1.4?? Really? For that matter Any of my medium format cameras with 80 and I am still lighter and smaller with that? Â But hey you can&#8217;t shoot at 8 frames/second and 6400 ISO what about that? Screw it. Don&#8217;t want it - don&#8217;t need it - and at F1.4 Portra 800 or Fuji looks great in the same light.</li>
    <li>My LX5 is great - amazing for what it is. As a gadget freak it does unbelievable things. Does it look nearly as good at ANY of my 35mm compacts? No. I use it when I don&#8217;t give a crap. Even when I had my FX sized DSLR and medium format backs I still shot film for stuff I care about. and was likely to care about a year later.</li>
</ul>


<p>Just some things to chew on. Simple is good. It&#8217;s good for your state of mind, it&#8217;s good for your pictures. Here is a casual shot from last summer. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LM6UJC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B000LM6UJC">Portra 160VC</a> with my Leica M6 and 50 Summicron. This is fairly decent skin tones right out of the box on my uncalibrated scanner. Would the D3 be better? No way - in fact it would be a lot worse for a number of reasons. Is it somehow inferior I don&#8217;t think so. Could you make the same image that looks as good using a digicam? No way. How about a $100 Nikon FM or FE - absolutely.</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;201000125cn-as-Smart-Object-1&#8221; size=&#8221;full&#8221; id=&#8221;3137&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>Would this image be better if there was no film grain/noise when looking at it at &#8220;100%&#8221;? No. Would the color be &#8220;better&#8221; No. Would there be some wonderful detail that somehow isn&#8217;t there? No. The skin tone would probably be nuclear, the hair would be some strange noisy digital mess, The out of focus trees would be really funky, distracting, artificial looking, harsh, and probably more yellow, The sky would have no tone without lots of screwing around, Â Would AF somehow figured out how to focus at f 2.0 better and sharper? No. For that matter none of my shots on this roll were in anyway out of focus and better yet - the focus was exactly where I wanted it. Could I somehow screw around with a digital capture in ways I can&#8217;t screw around with this? No - in fact I have way more data to play with should I want to.</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;201000115cn-as-Smart-Object-1&#8221; size=&#8221;full&#8221; id=&#8221;3136&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>Would this one be better on digital? Would Auto WB some how save this shot? Doubt it. If I wanted to play with the color balance I sure as well could just as easily as digital capture. If I had a lab scan it they would do it for me to my taste all included in the process/scan price. That&#8217;s a lot of labor for a great price. The color of the light was changing really fast here as it was going into twilight and I did want to demonstrate Â Portra&#8217;s almost magical ability to render skin in a pleasing and wonderful way almost no matter what the color balance of the light and overall image. Did I need ISO 1600 at twilight - nope.</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;201000114&#8221; size=&#8221;full&#8221; id=&#8221;3140&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>Are these AMAZING shots - no. Just my typical family snapshots Are they important? To you - no. To me - very. Would they somehow be better with a complicated, heavy, expensive DSLR last year, this year, or next year even? No, if they would be please let me know how. I would LOVE to hear it. If somehow your answer is in post processing - forget it. I can do that if I want but don;t have to or want to. For the same price as processing, I can have someone else do it for me to my liking very consistently. Based on 200,000+ shots on digital over the last 12 years I can guess at some ways digital capture would possibly and probably be worse.</p>

<p>Just some things to think about when reaching into your wallet for the next new wonder-DSLR. Sure I will use digital when I have to or when it actually helps me to, or for that matter just to play around but I love the simplicity of film cameras and I long for a digital that has some of those properties at a reasonable cost and maybe even some of the more redeeming characteristics of film.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am making an announcement today on behalf of Nikon. You will get the info exclusively here as I am actually pre-announcing their new mid-range full-frame FX camera before they have even planned it. Below is an image of the prototype I have been testing as well as a list of the features and controls.</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;FE&#8221; size=&#8221;full&#8221; id=&#8221;3133&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<ol>
    <li>Full frame FX sensor format with a gorgeous viewfinder perfect for super fast and accurate manual focus at apertures up to f 1.0.</li>
    <li>Interchangeable camera backs that contain the latest greatest full frame sensor or use any old back from an FE/FM/FM2/FE2 to shoot film.</li>
    <li>Shutter speed knob, Aperture Ring, Manual, Aperture Priority AE - that&#8217;s it.</li>
    <li>ISO dial selects meter sensitivity and controls ISO for digital backs. All computing capability is contained in interchangeable back.</li>
    <li>Rugged build, all metal shell.</li>
    <li>Approximately 1/3 size of the D700.</li>
    <li>Can mount any lens ever made (except G lenses which will be discontinued).</li>
    <li>No batteries&#8230; All power for the next shot is provided by winding the film advance lever.</li>
    <li>Planned MSRP is $999, street price around $800.</li>
</ol>


<p>Why haven&#8217;t we seen something even remotely close to this so far? Maybe I am going just a hair too far here but I for one would definitely buy two of them. Have you guys noticed the freaking size of the D700 or D3 or for that matter just about any DSLR compared to something like an FM/FE? Would you buy something like this? Even without the self-powered film wind-y thing and the interchangeable sensor/electronics backs? I certainly would. Leica sorta did it - sorta and they can&#8217;t keep the M9 on the shelves.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yep, No crap. As most parents would be, I am excited and worried all at the same time but I won&#8217;t go into that. I will go into a little bit on how this relates to our collective photographic life. Specifically what to do and how to prepare yourself and the parents to be. Maybe a new camera or lens? What if they aren&#8217;t really that photographically inclined? Maybe but one thing I am sure of is that you cannot ever have enough images of your family. The second thing I am sure of is that it&#8217;s not a bad idea to use film, even if it&#8217;s not your exclusive image capture medium - definitely use it.</p>

<p>Here is an image I recently scanned. It came out of a box of print packs and film envelopes that have been mistreated in major ways. This was one of my reject piles. One of many. With film I never throw anything away - prints or negatives. Especially negatives. My reject boxes are not even remotely organized but at least they exist with contact sheets and occasionally a package of 4x6 prints. I remember why this was a reject. I shot it on Kodak Royal Gold 400. My films of choice were the Kodak Portra family of films but for some reason or another I was always acquiring some sort of promotional film packs from both Fuji and Kodak. I shot them but never really like the way they looked compared to Portra. I happened to shoot some Portra 160NC of this occasion that looked great so I these shots got relegated to the reject pile.</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;200000211cn-v2&#8221; size=&#8221;full&#8221; id=&#8221;3127&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>A dozen years later I certainly like the look of even this film (too too warm for my tastes) better than most digital. Especially most digicam images. I was one of the few photographers that I know that shot as much of his kids as I did. You would be surprised at how that gets neglected. I probably have 30,000 or more images of my three daughters on film - both color and black and white. Even after the digital revolution I continued to shoot film when I made images that were important to me and I am glad I did.</p>

<p>This negative looks soooo much better than dgital. It makes a fantastic 13x19 print that is perfect. I just made one. It has depth and color that are really hard to do even today. This is pretty much a strait scan. No fuss no muss. My expectant daughter happens to love photography, not the technical part, more importantly the image taking part and the aesthetic part. A while back <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2010/04/03/check-this-nikon-out-seventy-bucks/">I gave her an beautiful Nikon FM and Â 50 1.4</a>. So what am I going to do to prepare for the arrival of my first grandchild? I am going to keep her well stocked with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FNRTGG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B004FNRTGG">Kodak Portra 400</a> as well as take care of the processing printing and scanning for her. That and insist on her shooting at least 1 roll a week, even if she uses a digicam.</p>

<p>I know from my own experience that upon reflection a lot of the wiz bang wears off with digital. The whole &#8220;look ma, I can look at it at 100% and there is no grain&#8221; effect has no bearing on what the overall photograph looks like. Looking back my film looks far far better - especially in retrospect - than any of my digital of the same vintage. I also know that what images you may like now change a whole lot in 5 or 10 years. It&#8217;s too too easy to delete digital images after glancing at them on your camera or computer. It takes far more effort to cut one negative off a strip to make it go away. Come to think of it, I may even take care of filing negatives for my daughter as well. For her it will be as convenient as digital without the instant turn around. Hey that&#8217;s more fun anyway.</p>

<p>For those that gotta know - the attached image was shot on the way to my daughter&#8217;s dance recital in hand held, using available light with a Nikon F2 and 85 1.4 wide open or at f 2. For you pixel mongers here is the 100% pixel view of a 4000dpi scan (approx. a 6 foot high print). Click to see all the pixels - note there is only a tiny plane that is actually in focus at this large of an Aperture&#8230;.</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;200000211cn-v2-full1&#8221; size=&#8221;full&#8221; id=&#8221;3125&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>Please wish my daughters new and growing family luck.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have set my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J2AB94/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B000J2AB94">expectations of the Sigma SD14</a> so very low based on my experience with the DP1s that I am actually impressed with Sigma&#8217;s very old DSLR. I do have some serious criticisms as cameras go but overall this is not a bad camera to actually use. My first chance to use the thing was late afternoon yesterday. I had some meetings in the morning, then rain, and then some really whacky daylight/cloudy lighting conditions - not very pretty for shooting my typical StupidCrapâ¢ test images.</p>

<p>Having received the Sigma 50mm 1.4 EX I just had to take a walk down the street and shoot <em>something</em>, anything. I will review the lens performance in a separate post for now, just the body and maybe a little on how it lives with the big 50. The camera is dead simple, not too many features, modes, gee-gaws, or special image settings. It has a knob that turns it on and controls drive mod, a knob with the familiar PASM exposure modes, a shutter release, a command dial, and a few buttons on the back for the normal things. While actually shooting you can ignore most of the things on the back - they really don&#8217;t do much.</p>

<p>The camera is really really quiet compared to most every camera I have used in the last 20 years with the exception of the Leica. There is no perceptible shutter lag, and shot to shot performance is actually quite good as long as you do not fill the meager buffer. For normal people that take a shot or three and then move on to the next composition it is fine. If you need to shoot 50 frames really fast - not so good. Me - I couldn&#8217;t care less as long as I can shoot when I press the button and the camera doesn&#8217;t stop me from taking the next shot or maybe the one after that. If I can&#8217;t nail what I want in two or three I need to re-think what I am doing anyway.</p>

<p>The focus performance in actually pretty good with the center sensor. Far better than I expected from my experience with the DP1s and bullshit you read in forums. Is it as good as a Nikon D3? No. I would put it somewhere better than when we all decided auto-focus was actually useful, say somewhere around an Nikon F4 or better. I will probably only use the center sensor myself - like the old days. The center sensor is the only &#8220;good&#8221; one, the others are not quite as good and they are kind of a pain to switch around. Unlike every other camera in the universe you don&#8217;t use the joystick pad to change them - you use a button on the back and the command dial around the shutter button. Who cares, the focus screen is actually useful for manual focus. That was a surprise for me, I haven&#8217;t seen that in an AF SLR in a long long time.</p>

<p>Metering seems fine in evaluative but for my style shooting I will probably end up using either center weighted or center spot most of the time. I have nothing against fancy multi=pattern metering but the reality of what I shoot is that I actually never just pull my camera out of the bag - turn it on and shoot with no thought as to what the light is and what the camera is pointing at. For me the ONLY thing multi-pattern metering does is provide for a chance that the meter will do something that I don&#8217;t want it to do. In other words it is a variable for me - not a life saver. The interesting thing is that the center spot metering mode isn&#8217;t really spot metering as most would describe. It&#8217;s far more like a Leica M meter where it is a large spot that is not at all influenced by what is outside the area marked in the viewfinder. I may actually find that I like this as I am so used to it with Leica M cameras.</p>

<p>So here are the very first few shots from my walk down the street yesterday - most of them shot at F1.4 using AF in aperture priority mode. Maybe one or two at F 2 or F4. Random thoughts on camera performance and more importantly sensor performance accompany the StupidCrapâ¢ test images. For the most part I just changed the WB of the images in Sigma Photo Pro. I have no idea yet what my work flow is going to be and the best way to process these files so please excuse the shoddy work. The files are pretty amazing.</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;SDIM0207_1&#8221; size=&#8221;full&#8221; id=&#8221;3122&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>Check out the color - fantastic. I shot them all on auto white balance. I probably won&#8217;t do that again as most of them were wrong and random. The differentiation of the yellows is fantastic performance for a digital camera. Highlight rendering is great - pay attention to the whites in the upper left of the image above. This kind of stuff is a real pain in the ass with most digital capture involving a lot of fiddling around. With the Foveon it looks great out of the box.</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;SDIM0218&#8221; size=&#8221;full&#8221; id=&#8221;3098&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>This old dingy is almost buried and mostly grown over. No focus issues at all at F1.4. I focused on the top of the M in MD&#8230; Again the color and gradation is pretty fantastic. This is cliche at this point but it is really a whole lot like film rendering.</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;SDIM0213&#8221; size=&#8221;full&#8221; id=&#8221;3097&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>Some kayaks Â and canoes at F1.4. Reds are good and great differentiation of greens.</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;SDIM0288&#8221; size=&#8221;full&#8221; id=&#8221;3118&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>Focus on the center leaf is great wide open. I don&#8217;t think I will bother with fiddling around with formal focus test charts. As of right now I have confidence that focus issues will probably be my fault and not the camera/lens&#8217; fault. In real life calibrate all you want but unless you are shooting on a tripod taking great care when focusing close up at F1.4 any <em>mis-calibration</em> is just as likely to save the shot vs ruin it if making images handheld with live subjects.</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;SDIM0285&#8221; size=&#8221;full&#8221; id=&#8221;3116&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>Just wanted to see what varying degrees of fine texture looked like in varying degrees of focus. Looks pretty good to me. Awful image - good camera. This is the kind of thing that drives me insane with digital. Leaves and such at various spacial frequencies at various degrees of in/out of focus that look like dog-doo on digital seem to look good on the Foveon. Again - very film like. I am going to shoot this against some of that new Kodak Portra to compare. Maybe next week.</p>

<p>Let me leave you with this. I got this camera brand new for less than $400. It is a steal. Yes it has it&#8217;s flaws, it&#8217;s primarily a low light camera, has crappy auto-WB, useless AE-lock button but the rest of it seems to be a nice simple, well performing camera. It&#8217;s also quiet as can be and takes what I consider to be fantastic pictures from an overall effect standpoint. I see a lot of the things that I like about film when looking at the Foveon images. The images look great up-sized to 18 megapixels even using the primitive &#8220;double size&#8221; function in Sigma Photo Pro. These images easily hold up to the likes of Nikon and Canon 10-12 Mpix cameras and exceed them in a few ways depending on how you like your tones rendered. I may actually buy the only other one available on Amazon before it&#8217;t too late.</p>

<p>Here is one more image for consideration - again crappy image but shows me what I wanted to see. This is a &#8220;full size&#8221; crop of a tiny section of image that was cut out of an image of water that was up-sized to 18 Megapixels. Take my word for it, bayer sensor cameras anywhere near Â 10-15 megapixels have a very difficult time rendering b\subtle gradation like this at this level of magnification. If I have time I will try to shoot some compares that actually show this. If you have spent a lot of time looking closely at the way film and dozens of digital cameras render gradation like I have you will probably be able to see what I am talking about.</p>

<p>Click on the image to see it full size - any artifacts are due to Worpress re-re-re-re-re-compressing the original JPEG.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wrote yesterday about having a strange nagging desire for another Foveon based camera due to my attraction to the couple images that I shot with that dog of a camera, the DP1s prior to returning it. I knew I would not be getting another one of the DP series cameras as they are <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/01/31/cameras-i-wanted-to-love-but-couldnt/">horrible devices to actually use</a> in more ways than I can articulate. So I was thinking of an SD15, those cameras are below a 1000 bucks new at this point.</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;sd14-sl-002&#8221; size=&#8221;full&#8221; id=&#8221;3087&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>As I happen to have about that much laying around that was earmarked for a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042X9LC4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B0042X9LC4">Nikon D7000</a>. I was thinking hey why not the Sigma? Well better judgement got the better of me and I didn&#8217;t spend the bucks on a camera that I know will be slow, have no high ISO, etc, etc. Instead I found a new in box factory refurbished SD14. Same sensor, just slower, and even less high ISO capability. So instead of spending a thousand bucks, I spent $400. Â Hey if I know all of the SD series cameras are slow, low ISO machines why bother putting out the money for a truly inconsequential Â bump in speed and ISO/noise capability.</p>

<p>Hmmm, now what am I going to do about lenses. I could by a Nikon mount conversion kit for it. Or an M42 adapter and by like 9 ultra cheap old lenses. That might be the way to go for me on the cheap. Using my considerable powers of rationalization I figured I had $600+ of &#8220;found money&#8221; that I didn&#8217;t spend on the camera body that was just begging to be spent on a lens. I ended up grabbing a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dsigma%252050mm%25201.4%2520EX%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%23&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Sigma SA mount 50mm EX 1.4</a> - this should make a great portrait lens as that is what I intend to use this camera for.</p>

<p>I will let you know how it goes - vicarious living through RB&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You know that camera I ordered yesterday, the Sigma SD14. It came today. Yep, even with standard shipping. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018ZDGAW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B0018ZDGAW">50mm 1.4 EX DG</a> lens that I ordered didn&#8217;t even ship yet. So what is a guy to do? For me, I still had a couple hundred bucks of found money laying around from not buying something else that was more expensive (see how that works?). I bought a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009N5IR/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B00009N5IR">Sigma 28 1.8 EX DG</a>. These things are dirt cheap. Now the focus is slow but who cares. The whole Sigma AF thing is crap in any case. I expidited the shipping and we&#8217;ll see which one gets here first. I hope one of them arrives soon or might have to order something else absurd that I really can&#8217;t afford and definitely don&#8217;t need.</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;sd14-sl-001&#8221; size=&#8221;full&#8221; id=&#8221;3091&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>As for the camera, a modern Nikon it isn&#8217;t in terms of ergonomics but for how I like to work it may just fit the bill. I shoot some street, some portraits, some archtecture but almost always am shooting in either Aperture priority or Manual exposure and for the most part use manual focus. The shutter speeds are easy enough to manipulate and so is the aperture, especially because the lenses actually have an aperture ring. There seems to be a thing I can turn on the lens for focus and to tell you the truth, I prefer it that way. The way most of my favorite cameras work.</p>

<p>As for the rest of the camera it is refreshingly free of the 700 million settings. It really doesn&#8217;t <em>do</em> that much.Thank god. I will use this thing in Nikon FE/F3 mode for the most part. In fact I don&#8217;t think I will ever have to go back into the menus again. Easy-peasy Â I don&#8217;t chimp so I do no care about the screen size or resolution. I occasionally check the histogram - as in rare occasions. Unless I find some enormous flaws this might actually be fun to use. I already know what I like about it - the color, the way it renders skin, and hair. This might be not only fun but a cheap date as well considering I will have my most used large aperture lenses to boot - a normal and a short tele. If I do like it I will probably need a wide - either a 21mm equivalent or a 24mm equivalent.</p>

<p>It seems to be able to shoot 5-7 seven shots in rapid sequence with not much lag - good enough for me even though the write to card is glacial. I shoot 2-3 in rapid succession as my analysis of EXIF over the last 10 years has proven. The only thing I really care about is it doesn&#8217;t seem to hold me up from the first to the next one. It also starts up fast compared to that dog the DP1s.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll see.</p>
