I jumped on board Aperture from day one and believe that the product&#8217;s introduction was revolutionary. Heck it kicked Adobe in the head and woke the digital media giant into understanding what photographers really need, hence Photoshop Lightroom and now the (if I must say so) excellent Lightroom2. I can forgive Apple for the lame plugin implementation of dodge and burn, I can forgive no multi-adjustment presets, even if they do seem idiotically easy to implement. What I am starting to question is the Aperture development team&#8217;s commitment to a  professional product. Maybe I will rant about that later, for now I just wanted to cover a new development that has been a minor annoyance for myself and other RAW shooters for a long time.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/FromIweb/DSC_9109.jpg" rel="lightbox"  ><img src="/wp-content/uploads/FromIweb/.thumbs/.DSC_9109.jpg" alt="DSC_9109.jpg" title="DSC_9109.jpg" align="left" width="101" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="0" /></a>White backgrounds are very popular for just about every kind of studio shot that might come along. Fashion, beauty, headshots, etc, etc, etc. So knowing how to do a white background properly is pretty basic stuff. So how did I screw that up you might ask. Iâ€™ll give you the answer in a second.</p>

<p>To do a white background itâ€™s pretty simple. Get a roll of white seamless paper, white foamcore, whatever and make sure that you light it so it turns out actually white. The easiest way to do this is setup two lights with umbrellas painted at 45Âº at equal distance from the paper. Get them as even as you can and you are gold. Just a couple of notes. If you are really really picky about your exposure and know your cameraâ€™s sensor/film very very well you can get away with a background exposure at whatever your taking aperture is, i.e. incident meter at your seamless = your camera f-stop. If you are like the rest of us about 1-stop over exposed at the seamless will be great. A lot of people just starting to monkey around with this stuff go way overboard in dumping light on the white seamless because thatâ€™s what they think they want. Namely they want it to blow it out. Now hereâ€™s the issue, if you do that you will be fighting major flare unless your background is about a mile and a half away from your subject. Exaggeration to make a point, the point being use as little light as required to make the background go white, since the paper is actually white it doesnâ€™t take much. </div>

The first image was about 2 stops under what the good old matrix metering in the Nikon suggested. The 2 stop under image held the highlights and color that is the sun way better than the â€œnormalâ€ exposure did. So that was my starting RAW file for the 30 seconds worth of adjustments that I did using Appleâ€™s Aperture highlight and shadow adjustments. My goal was not aesthetic but more to try to match the results of the HDR image at the top of the page. If you donâ€™t know aperture, the highlight and shadow adjustment in that software is an almost magically easy way to do exactly what the name of the tool suggests. There are equivalent ways of doing the same thing in Photoshop and Lightroom. So here is what about 30 seconds of messing with the highlight and shadow sliders can do in terms of matching an HDR. Not bad except for the halos both dark and light and the noise.</p>

Second beauty dishes produce more contrast and zip than boxes do, they have a more specular quality to highlights they produce. Third they have a very different falloff pattern than soft boxes or umbrellas do. Fourth, the good ones that have a glass or plastic translucent center diffuser have a hot spot in the center portion of the light pattern that they throw. In my opinion these are the reasons that you want a beauty dish in the first place, not just because they are sort of big. If it is just the size of light that you are after soft boxes are way easier to carry around  especially the smaller ones that are the same size as a dish. If you want just a round catch light a circular mask on your box will do the trick, also easy to carry around. If you want less spill, nylon grids are great on a box.</div>

Where should I start? There are so many millions of how to technical info-mercials out there I will dispense with starting at the beginning and just jump right into the thick of it.</p>

<p>If you shoot RAW you can do anything you want to WB in post, most of what I am going to talk about regarding white balance assumes that you want to be efficient when it comes to corrections and enhancements when it comes to post with a couple of exceptions towards the end. If you shoot JPG most of the things discussed will be pretty darn important because the color is baked into your files and major corrections or enhancements will  not give you wonderful results. So here we go.</p>

I did put a free PDF together that was downloaded about 10,000 times. I had so many suggestions and questions that I decided to make a much larger more comprehensive version. It covers far far more and provides a ton of useful work-flow tips and examples on how to be extremely efficient. Even if you have been using Aperture for years you will probably find a lot of things in the new Organization eBook that you might not have even thought about. Sadly the new version is not free but I can tell you that I surveyed everything else out there and you will not find a better or more advanced discussion of Aperture&#8217;s organizational capabilities. Here is the link to the new illustrated more comprehensive Guide to Aperture 2 Organization eBook PDF:</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/aperture-ebooks/">Aperture eBooks</a></p>

<p>Oh one more thing - just because it is only five bucks doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not better than other way more expensive resources. It is - in most cases you will learn more from this guide than reading everything else out there in print and on the web. This is not a regurgitation of the Aperture documentation and this is not a book for dummies. Consider me an extremely value conscious Robin Hood.</p>

<p>Please leave comments with any feedback or email me here <a href="mailto:rwboyer@mac.com">rwboyer@mac.com</a><a href="Entries/2008/7/15_Apple_Aperture_2.1_Organization_files/mailto%253Arwboyer%2540mac.com"></a></p>

<p>The following is a snip of the original post describing the screen shot above.</p>

<p>Here is a description of a few things going on with this structure that may help clarify how one can use some of the grouping features of Aperture.</p>

<p>Note the blue folders - these can contain projects, other blue folders, and a few items that are usually found inside projects (smart albums etc.) I use these to group related projects and some items that are useful that are associated with the grouped projects.</p>

<p>Looking at the blue folder named &#8220;Glamour&#8221; you can see that there are a bunch of yellow project boxes in there, they are all individual studio sessions that I shot as promo material for lighting workshops that I do. There is also another blue folder inside of &#8220;Glamour&#8221; named &#8220;Albums&#8221;. Note that they do not &#8220;live&#8221; in a project at all. I am using those to group images of the same model that are in more that one project. There is also a purple smart album named &#8220;Rated&#8221; that lives at the top level of the &#8220;Glamour&#8221; folder. I am using this smart album to collect all of the images that have a rating of one star or above in all of the different projects under the &#8220;Glamour&#8221; folder. Since I created the smart album inside of the &#8220;Glamour&#8221; folder it is only going to collect images in projects under that folder, not everything in the library. This is a great way to limit the context of smart albums etc. with out making ridiculously complex search criteria or going back and redoing a bunch of keywording etc. One other note, There is a project in the &#8220;Glamour&#8221; folder named &#8220;Workshop&#8221; this project contains a couple of objects, namely Layout, Prints, and Workshop Book. This Workshop project contains NO image masters or versions but does contain pointers to masters/versions in other projects under &#8220;Glamour&#8221;. I use this project to contain a book and printed promo material that is derived from images that are in the rated smart album. Why is it in a project? So that I can export it as an Aperture project and import it to other Aperture libraries. Why do I have the static albums for each model? So I can keep a static order to the images and run a slideshow preset on them.</p>

<p>Onto another blue folder &#8220;Experimental Projects&#8221;, I am using this to group two projects that I was actually shooting today. If you look at the project &#8220;Ghost Ships&#8221; you can see yellow folders named &#8220;Albums&#8221; and &#8220;Light Tables&#8221;. Yellow folders are really simple, they exist only inside projects and are used to group and organize stuff inside projects. Here I am using them in an extremely simple way. One for my albums, one for some layout ideas on how different images play together. After I export the project and import it to my main library on my desktop workstation the population of yellow folders under that project will probably change quite a bit to group a bunch of different but related things together.</p>

<p>This is a very basic example of folders and projects. If anyone is interested at all I would be glad to put an illustrated PDF guide together that explains exactly how all of this stuff works in different contexts and workflows along with some ideas on how each feature from basic to advanced context tricks can be used effectively. Just leave a message here or hit me up on my email.</p>

<p>Finally had a chance to do some editing and corrected some typos and minor phasing.</p>

To follow along and eliminate any ambiguity or to confirm what the words in this installment are saying, feel free to load the linked image into your favorite software that can display luminance values of specific areas of the image.</p>

<p>First off the lighting setup: Large box (3â€™x4â€™) at 45Â° to camera right and high enough to cast shadow under the eyebrows. Exposure metered at the face is f11. The light that is actually included in the shot is as you can verify behind and at about head level pointed strait ahead. It has a very narrow grid on it and a full CTO gel. Exposure value is again at f11. The last light is a 1x3 strip box located to camera left and about 45Â° behind the model and slightly above. Exposure value is about 2/3 to 1 full stop below f11, Yep below, like f8 to f8 1/3.</div>

The point that I was demonstrating happened to be exposure values versus perceived tonal values in various parts of the image depending on local contrast. More on that subject another day. During the demonstration I used a couple of terms that were either unfamiliar to the participants or were perceived in a different way than I perceived them. In any event, a discussion followed that I thought was very useful and thought I would share a summary.</div>

The article was all fine and dandy it&#8217;s purpose was to discuss the shortcomings of a certain piece of software. It really doesn&#8217;t matter what the software was or what it&#8217;s shortcomings were. The problem was that the author was doling out advice and work-arounds that are dead wrong. This prompted me to attempt to write a brief explanation of color management principles and practice that can be easily understood and hopefully provide some context when reading all of the hocus pocus, chicken bone waving non-sense out in the world. So let&#8217;s get started&#8230;</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/histogram.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-251" title="histogram" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/histogram.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="95" /></a>If you saw a histogram like this one on the back of your camera what would you think? Mull it over while I yammer on about what a histogram is.
A histogram is a graph representing the relative number of pixels of a particular tonal value and in the case above a color value as well. Great what the heck does that mean. For now we&#8217;ll stick with tonal values for simplicity. Tonal value 0 would be all the way on the left and it is dark. Tonal value 255 would be all the way on the right and it is light. Tonal value 128 would be in the middle and is&#8230; well&#8230; medium. If the pixels in an image were all black there would be a line going strait up to the top of the histogram all the way on the left. If all the pixels were white that line would be at the right. If they were different values but close together there would be more of a mountain kind of shape in the histogram at what ever tonal value where they fell. The steeper the mountain the closer the pixels are in tone. The more gentle the slope the farther apart in tone the pixels are.</div>
