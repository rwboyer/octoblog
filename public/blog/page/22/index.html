  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/2002-005-09.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2190" title="2002-005-09" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/2002-005-09-300x239.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="239" /></a>You can&#8217;t tell from the comments but the most popular post last week by far was the tiny little post on window light that I put up on the site. This is all stuff that &#8220;we&#8221; already know but tend to forget about and don&#8217;t practice it as time goes by and little TTL flashes creep into the mix and experiments with HDR cram our brains, and, and. I thought it would be useful to every once in a while call a time out for all that and get back to some basic simple stuff that anyone can do almost anywhere, with any equipment and produce some great results that are a little off the beaten track from the eye-poping, retina burning, wild ride, &#8220;lighting effects&#8221; that are assaulting us all daily.</p>

<p>As I mentioned you can get close but never can quite reproduce window light by artificial means. More on that someday soon - I worked on it for years and still prefer a real window with real sunlight, and real sky. So let&#8217;s get on with the tips.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Windows are fixed but you can produce any direction you want as long as you move your subject. Duhhh.</li>
    <li>Big dark colored rooms produce dramatically different effects than smaller light colored rooms. I do mean dramatic. In fact small rooms with dark walls simulate larger rooms with light colored walls and vis-a-vis. Narrow long rooms are different from square rooms - by far. Of course you know why this is - fill ratio and just as important where that fill comes from. You can simulate one or the other with either reflectors or black anti reflectors but the effect will be a little different. The shot included with this post is one of my favorite &#8220;rooms - an open stairwell with a window at the bottom of the stairs and enough room to shoot width wise but still very narrow. This creates a tiny bit of fill from the front but very little from the opposite end off the window or side.</li>
    <li>Window light - I am talking about sky through window not sun through window - is way more contrasty than you think it is. Window light is very soft but very contrasty. Soft light does not mean low contrast scene. The closer your subject is to the window relative to the walls the more contrasty it will get. Your eyes will fool you. You can make adjustments to this ratio by moving your subject closer to the window or farther away from it but this changes a lot of other things to. Don&#8217;t be afraid of the contrast, don&#8217;t always try to eliminate it to get a &#8220;good histogram&#8221;, at least not always. Contrast is not your enemy. Use it, be aware of it and pay attention to where your shadows are - they can be your friend, digital guys - let the freaking shadows go black for once. It&#8217;s okay.</li>
    <li>Try something you almost never do - or at least I never do with strobes - put your subject almost against your background. With strobes - even with soft boxes this almost always looks like crap for a lot of reasons (especially without enormous care), with windows you can get some fantastic effects and it can actually help your background / subject separation. Look at the included image - not the best image but pleasing light. The subject is almost right against the background. Some things to look out for is the gradient / fall-off of the window light. With a little practice you will be able to see this very clearly. Strategiclly placing your subject so the wall is lit behind the shadow on your subject looks fantastic. If your subject casts a shadow that masks that beautiful gradient - move him/her forward a bit - as in inches not feet. You can see the difference this few inches makes if you <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2010/08/18/things-you-can-do-with-a-window/">compare the image I posted in the last window light post</a>.</li>
    <li>Speaking of separation - watch the luminance separation of subject skin vs background, not just the color separation. Again you can do this with the gradient on the wall in some cases. In others dark hair works - as in the attached image where the face is framed on the highlight side of the face. In any case just watch for it.</li>
    <li>If you include the window - you have two choices. Factor it into your exposure or ignore it as it relates to your exposure. For the most part ignore it and base your exposure on the subject so the highlights on the subject are where you want them - bright. This means the actual window with be &#8220;blown&#8221; (well at least for you digital guys) So what! You are including the actual light source in the photo - this is fine it should be white, really white. This means manual exposure. The only case that I have seen really work where you really care about detail in the window is when you are backlighting and actually want a silhouette. Just a guide line - feel free to play around in between the two  extremes.</li>
</ol>


<p>Enjoy.</p>

<p>Ps one more thing for the curious. Photo above shot with Hasselblad 503CXi, 80mm CFe, APX 100, processed in Rodinal 1+50 by yours truly. No digital non-sense or local adjustments just a black point setting to make film base black and a resize.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Delta100-print.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2183" title="Delta100-print" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Delta100-print-300x241.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="241" /></a>I know - too much about film. Don&#8217;t worry the only reason is I have had Aperture 3 on the brain for way way too long over the last few days going through the latest soon to be released (this week I promise) Organization eBook. So now that I took a break from that today I wanted to wrap up the ongoing mini-posts I have been doing on Delta 100.</p>

<p>So far we have seen a bit of the image I wanted to talk about rear it&#8217;s ugly head in <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2010/08/16/selecting-a-film-developer/">some thoughts on selecting a developer </a>, and my little <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2010/08/22/strange-things-photographers-do/">quirk about hating bar codes on my contact sheets</a>. Today I wanted to walk through the random care-free process in arriving at a black and white proof print from said film and negative. Just for a recap I&#8217;ll go through it blow by blow. You might find it entertaining.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Find 9 year out of date Ilford Delta 100 in a box in the garage.</li>
    <li>Blow through shooting any stupid crap within 20 feet of my current location, not really giving a hoot about the scene, or thinking too much about exposure. I already did that on frames one through 6. I have 30 more to go and I am in a hurry. I just have to see how bad it is in terms of grain, fog, contrast. You know because being a cheap skate and a film shooter - I want to see if this stuff works. My usual MO for &#8220;testing&#8221; is stupid crap so I don&#8217;t have anxiety about shooting stuff I care about. Honestly I need to stop doing that, I mean what&#8217;s the big deal it&#8217;s not like life and death, it&#8217;s a poor excuse for not being creative - or wait a second, maybe it&#8217;s a great scape goat for being creative and not feeling too bad when it doesn&#8217;t work out. I will figure that out some day.</li>
    <li>Pick a random development time based on film age and a developer (Pyrocat HD) I have never used with this film before. I just picked the same time as I use for fresh TMAX 100, I kind of remember them being close in a different developer that I tested with like 10 years ago. Now add a bit to make up for contrast loss that you don&#8217;t know exists.</li>
    <li>Look at the negatives and scan a random one to play with. Heck post it in a few thoughts about random stuff as well, that way I don&#8217;t have to go look for an appropriate image - you know how long that can take - and god knows I don&#8217;t want to go make an image that is on my mind. That is a lot of work.</li>
    <li>Curiosity builds up over a couple of days because I actually kinda sorta like the random stupid crap image of the eagle in the clouds. I do kind of remember that for this shot I carefully composed so that the overhead wires would blend into the far shoreline and I did wait until the freaking bird flew into a reasonably cool spot. If I would have put the bird where I wanted to the damn wires would look like crap. Well that&#8217;s what you get when you can&#8217;t walk across the street because you are too too lazy. Any way curious - how will it look printed on real paper and how close to printing well on grade 2 did I get? You see this will find tune my process for shooting other stupid crap on the next roll.</li>
    <li>Fire up the darkroom - aka the bathroom with my handy dandy light blocking tricks. I haven&#8217;t had a dedicated darkroom in five years - I keep meaning to build one but I have moved too often and I will be moving again any second.</li>
    <li>Print number one - grade 2, exposure guess based on a finger in the wind and around where I always start - 15 seconds f 8 for an 8x10. Develop, fix, wash - too light and I want more contrast.</li>
    <li>What fine exhibit you see here folks is print number 2 - going overboard the other way, 25 seconds at f5.6 on  grade 3. Hmmm it&#8217;s not perfect and it&#8217;s certainly not the best image ever made but it looks cool - I&#8217;ll live with it for a while and see if it speaks to me to make a real print on Fiber. The reality is grade 3 is too much contrast. But this is no local fooling around, no fiddling, no nothin&#8217; on print number 2.</li>
</ol>


<p>You have to admit - that work-flow is somewhat freeing in it&#8217;s simplicity and random care-free attitude. Truth be told I could probably make a fairly stunning print from this if the mood suites me to play with it some more. The funny thing is those two prints took me less time than scanning and resizing. They also have a beauty and depth that cannot be appreciated looking at a ShittyScan™ of the print.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s the moral to the story  - well the obvious one is how fool proof film is with a tiny tiny little bit of practice. I will not dwell on that. The other one is how awesome it feels to let go of the complexity in your usual process, work-flow, whatever you want to call it. Can you do that with digital? Maybe you can simulate it by shooting random JPEGs or something but it&#8217;s not even close to the same purging of complexity that you get buy shooting a roll of film every once in a while and ending up with a fairly cool print at the end of you fooling around as a necessity to even really see the freaking image. I swear I would do this at least once a month even if I still shot digital to make a living.</p>

<p>The last thing to take away from this is another kind of liberation that some of you may get if you are the kind of person that takes this stuff way way too seriously. Digital or film, no matter how you do it shoot like you don&#8217;t care every once in a while, shoot things you &#8220;know&#8221; won&#8217;t work, like a freaking bird that is 100-200 yards away with a 50mm lens. Whatever - I swear it&#8217;s amazing therapy to let go - make whatever excuse you want to make so you really do not care if it &#8220;turns out&#8221;. Will most of you images be crap - sure but you will learn something along the way and you will have some fun doing it. I can tell you from shooting commercial images for too long that the requirement to shoot what you know will work creeps into to every image you make and causes you to hesitate and edit things that &#8220;won&#8217;t work&#8221; without even taking the picture. I think this happens no matter what you shoot - find a way to break out of that for a little while. If 9 year out of date film is not your speed then use your really really old beater digital that is hopelessly obsolete and produces &#8220;crappy&#8221; images. You see, once the crappy is out of your control, it helps free you up mentally.</p>

<p>Take this as a counter balance to all of the other advice you get about using tripods, and careful calculated exposure, focus, composition, dynamic range, and everything else that&#8217;s filling your head. I think I will call this image &#8220;Eagle in the clouds&#8221;. Hmmmm - no, that&#8217;s not me - how about &#8220;Crappy stuff I shoot from my office window because I am too lazy to cross the street&#8221;? Yea that&#8217;s more my speed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some of you probably know that Jeanloup Sieff is one of my inspirations and has been since I was a young photographer in the 80&#8217;s. His work spans decades and transcends his label as a &#8220;fashion photographer&#8221;. Except for some of the well know iconic people that are in his images that for ever set a time - I feel that his work is as fresh and relevant as it was when it was first made.</p>

<p>I have written quite a bit about him and suggested a book titled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/382284439X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=382284439X">Jeanloup Sieff 40 Years of Photography</a> for those interested in seeing this man&#8217;s work along with a highly engaging read to boot. Well way back when I mentioned this book I had no idea it was so much money nowadays and issued an apology.  At the time copies were pushing $500. Well I just happened to look the other day and guess what - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/382284439X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=382284439X">there are a few copies available for $50</a>. At 50 bucks this is a must have for anyone that likes photo books and photographer&#8217;s monographs.</p>

<p>Check it out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I ran across a series of posts today about the results of shooting JUST a film Leica with one lens and even if you never intend on doing the Leica thing or the film thing it is a great read. <a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2010/08/a-leica-for-a-year-a-year-later.html">This is a series of comments from people that took that Leica suggestion</a> of shooting a film Leica with one lens for a year (it&#8217;s now a year or so later). This is the <a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2009/05/a-leica-year.html">original post that make the suggestion</a>, and this.. is <a href="http://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2009/05/why-it-has-to-be-a-leica.html">some other commentary </a>along the way.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Except for the occasional emotional outburst and associated ranting I do here you probably thing I am a fairly rational photographer. No voodoo or chicken bone waving kind of stuff - I like to know how things work including the materials and devices I use to make images with. Of course I am not all logic and ration, heck I use Leicas and some lenses that are not considered &#8220;the best&#8221; and film because I like the way it looks, and in some cases feels. I am sure that I could &#8220;rationalize&#8221; just about any of my choices but here is one that I thought you might get a kick out of that is completely indefensible from a rational point of view.</p>

<p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Delta100-880.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2170" title="Delta100-880" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Delta100-880-300x136.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="136" /></a></p>

<p>Ilford film and why a don&#8217;t use much of it to speak of. Yes I shot a roll of Delta 100 the other day that was 9 years old, I have a half a brick of it left from way back. Why do you think I have a brick of it from a decade ago? The answer is because I didn&#8217;t like it. Why you may ask didn&#8217;t I like it, was something wrong with it? Well&#8230; technically no but you see right after Ilford came out with the Delta line they also modified their 35mm film in a way that I found so horrible that I really could not stand it. They jammed a freaking indelible bar code on the bottom edge where the frame numbers used to be.</p>

<p>Take a look at how hideous this looks - really. I hated the way that this looked on my contact sheets so I never really considered shooting it. If I am not going to shoot it in 35mm I am definitely not going to shoot it in medium format or sheets - why would I? They don&#8217;t have barcodes in those formats but why waste the time and deal with the complexity of yet another film? I could easily justify this because I was really a TRI-X guy as opposed to an HP5plus guy anyway. Yes - when it comes to those two films it&#8217;s sort of like Ford or Chevy, or Canon and Nikon, you are either one or you are the other. I liked my old standby anyway - TMAX 100 so there you have it, barcodes are the answer to why I am not an Ilford shooter - I mean come on, what the hell are they for anyway - it&#8217;s not like you are going to run it through an auto processor are you? WTF? Those things look horrible and who the hell wants their contact sheets to look horrible. They also happen to be far far brighter than where good highlights are as well. Imagine showing a client or art director that horrible mess - they will be seeing barcodes burned into their retinas for the rest of the day - like when a flash goes off in your face.</p>

<p>I will bet you that you have some deep dark bias towards some sort of stuff in your image making chain as well. For equally as non-sensical a reason.</p>

Not just a one timer but this is one of the very few that are in my RSS feeds. There is a ton of great stuff here and the publisher continues to add new things constantly.</p>

<p>It is platform agnostic - it is not anything vs. anything, no film vs. digital, no Canon vs. Nikon, nada. Just great photography and topics related to photography. I guess one of the reasons that I am so drawn to it is it seems like people still like to make prints and books in Japan. You know how I am about prints and books. It&#8217;s not a photography until it is on paper. Photography is not a web only exercise from my perspective.</p>

<p>Anyway - <a href="http://www.japanexposures.com/" target="_blank">take a look there really is something for everyone</a> and in a Place where photography seems to be a national sport or pastime, the quality and diversity of the photography will blow you away.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The title is not a complaint. It really isn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s an observation on having purchased and lived with more camera toting gear, bags, backpacks, satchels, wraps, straps, and cases than I care to remember. Every single one of them was quickly became too small. I was thinking about this today when I pulled out my Domke F-803 to grab a pamphlet that I jammed in the back pocket about a week ago. I just <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RNPD42?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001RNPD42">ordered a new F-803, this one is in the new &#8220;ruggedwear&#8221; finish</a>. I assume it will be as durable as this one has been. Yea I know it doesn&#8217;t look too too bad in this image but trust me I have worn holes in it and it&#8217;s time. This one has been around the planet a couple of times and it really shows. The hooks are actually rusty.</p>

<p>On to the stupid thought of the day, the reason all camera bags are too small. You know the answer, it&#8217;s because we all insist on taking way way way too much stuff. Everything gets crammed in that can possibly fit. Now that is not a bad thing but what really happens is things you don&#8217;t need or at least don&#8217;t need on this outing find a home. Once something has found a home in a bag, it seems to never leave. It hangs around forever and then every time you get new gear it then needs a home and you get a bigger bag. If it ever leaves, it&#8217;s too late and you already have a bigger bag and any space is used up for the next generation stuff that eventually you will get rid of - but&#8230; not till you have a new bag.</p>

<p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/DSC_1294.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2159" title="DSC_1294" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/DSC_1294-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>

<p>I just quickly contrasted these two camera &#8220;bags&#8221;. My largest single bag and my smallest single bag. They are not the greatest examples right now for me but they will serve. Let&#8217;s take the Domke F-803 first. What do we have here?</p>

<ol>
    <li>Leica M6</li>
    <li>Leica 50mm Summicron</li>
    <li>Leica 50mm Elmar</li>
    <li>Leica 90mm Elmarit</li>
    <li>Leica 35mm Summicron ASPH</li>
    <li>Minolta Flash Meter IV or some such thing.</li>
    <li>Some extra batteries - A76&#8217;s or S76&#8217;s</li>
    <li>A flashlight</li>
    <li>A pencil</li>
    <li>A sharpie</li>
    <li>An old Nikon cleaning rag I forgot about</li>
    <li>A few rolls of TRI-X, TMAX 3200, Portra 160VC, Some TMAX 100</li>
</ol>


<p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/DSC_1297.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2160" title="DSC_1297" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/DSC_1297-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>

<p>That&#8217;s not too bad but what you don&#8217;t know is what is NOT there that usually is:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Leica M3</li>
    <li>Voigtlander 50mm Nokton f1.1</li>
    <li>A digital Point and Shoot</li>
    <li>A bunch more film</li>
    <li>Travel guides, maps, passport, credit cards, iPod, cigarettes, business cards, a notebook, assorted writing instruments, and a partridge in a pear tree.</li>
</ol>


<p>Wow - so what is the issue, an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001RNPD42?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001RNPD42">F-803 is small right</a>? Yes and I want to keep it that way. What the hell am I doing with a light meter and three 50mm lenses in that bag? How about a flashlight that I never use, i fact the batteries are dead, I forgot about it years ago. Well I guess it&#8217;s not a problem but what usually happens is that stuff migrates to a slightly bigger bag as soon as you have just one more thing that you must bring. Trust me NOTHING else will fit in there the way it is normally packed. In reality I could carry an even smaller bag with the stuff I actually use on most outings, and even trips. Maybe like that really small one, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BH3XXQ?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002BH3XXQ">Domke F-5XB</a>, it&#8217;s like half the size. Trust me If you know the F-803 and you just saw my list you may be scratching your head about how I got all that in there in the first place. It&#8217;s not pretty.</p>

<p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/DSC_1290.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2157" title="DSC_1290" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/DSC_1290-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>

<p>Moving on to the big camera &#8220;bag&#8221;, actually it is a Pelican hard case. It&#8217;s is absolutely the biggest container I will carry. I have some bigger stuff from Lightware that is for my strobes but I am talking camera carrying here. This thing is much bigger than it looks, let us see what is inside today:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Hasselblad 500 CM body</li>
    <li>Hasselblad 501 CM body</li>
    <li>Zeiss 50mm CFi FLE</li>
    <li>Zeiss 150mm CFi</li>
    <li>Zeiss 80mm CFe</li>
    <li>3 A12 Film Magazines</li>
    <li>A PM-45 Viewfinder</li>
    <li>Adapter rings for a Proshade</li>
    <li>A Proshade</li>
    <li>Two Extension Tubes</li>
    <li>A box of various filters</li>
    <li>A Polaroid film back</li>
    <li>A Propack of old film</li>
    <li>A Sekonic Zoom/Spot/Ambient flash meter</li>
    <li>Some batteries that probably don&#8217;t work</li>
</ol>


<p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/DSC_1293.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2158" title="DSC_1293" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/DSC_1293-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>

<p>Wait a second&#8230; A Polaroid film back, you have to be kidding right. Nope - I haven&#8217;t used that thing since I started chimping digital for exposure and lighting tests. WTF? The rest of it&#8217;s not so bad, well the old film and batteries are but hey&#8230; Actually all of it is ridiculous, really do you think I need all three lenses, a bunch of filters, extension tubes, two bodies, and three film magazines every time I shoot with the &#8216;blad? Of course not but what happens is that when I shoot MF my built in reaction is to just grab the &#8220;minimal&#8221; kit. Yes that is what I considered a &#8220;minimal&#8221; kit of medium format gear a while ago. A minimal kit for what you may ask. Well, a minimal kit for anything, having no idea what I was actually going to shoot.</p>

<p>Here is some practical advise for those of you new to this photography gear game. There is no such thing as a minimal kit when you have no idea what you are actually going to shoot. Don&#8217;t try to build one and jamb it in a camera bag, or a camera case. Try this little exercise for a little while, even if you do it mentally - physically is better but if you just won&#8217;t or just can&#8217;t then mentally will have to do.</p>

<p>Buy yourself a new camera bag, a ridiculously small one compared to what you normally carry. You probably already have several but they are old an boring so buy a new fancy cool looking one to get you motivated. Nothing motivates like a new piece of photo gear. Keep your old bag to. Unpack all of your equipment, every last thing so that all your bags are completely empty the big ones, the medium ones, the brand new itty bitty cool one you just bought and put all your stuff in a cupboard or something that you cannot possibly carry around with you. Next time you go somewhere to photograph, I do mean anywhere with any intent to make an image, decide before you go what kind of images you will make and pack that tiny new bag with as much stuff as you can fit that will help you get the pictures that you want to take. No more that is it. Go ahead stuff all you can in there but it must be the little new one.</p>

<p>Do this over the course of a few weeks. This may cause way way more anxiety than you think it will but it&#8217;s worth it. When you get home take it all back out and leave nothing in the bag. Obviously don&#8217;t blow a gig, do it on everything else, spec shoots, portfolio work, personal projects, family outings, whatever. I swear this will help you out in two ways. You will be far better at selecting the minimal equipment you need to make what kind of shot you intend and as a bonus you will actually get to the point where you will want to carry less all the time. Some of you may actually get better images to boot without the confusion and complexity that more gear clutters your brain with.</p>

They produce some of the coolest images with the most meager of gear. Should I learn the language first? I am actually serious about the Japan visit - even if just for a vacation and to see some of what I understand are a ton of photography exhibitions that are all over the place.</p>

<p>Anyway, remember t<a href="http://tokyocamerastyle.com/">his site I linked to a while ago</a> that displays images of the cameras people carry around Tokyo? Well his <a href="http://tokyocamerastyle.com/post/956904367/fukagawa-detail-of-michio-yamauchis-nikon-fm3a">latest post was about Michio Yamauchi&#8217;s camera</a> that he was carrying, an FM3a. One of the reasons that I love that site in addition to reassuring me that I am not the only nut shooting old cameras and film is that at least once a week I stumble across a photographer with really nice work. Check out <a href="http://www.yamauchi-michio.com/">Michio Yamauchi’s</a>. You have to see the photos on his &#8220;news&#8221; page all of them are really cool but the jumping cat from below against the city scape is awesome, hurry before he updates it and it is gone.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/2002-006-07.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2146" title="2002-006-07" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/2002-006-07-300x136.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="136" /></a>I know - we all know this and we all love our gear and our gadgets but sometimes less is actually more. Not always just sometimes. I thought I would remind everyone out there in photography land that sometimes the simplest approach can be the best. Take lighting for instance. I know it&#8217;s all the rage for everyone to get a bunch of small strobes and do all kind of whacky things with them off camera, or to just make sure that you have a bunch of shadow detail everywhere with auto fill-flash. Take a break from all the complexity and the fiddling around every once in a while. You might be happy with the results.</p>

<p>Use a window - the results can be really really nice. Trust me - one of the hardest things to fake is real honest to god north light from a window. There are reasons for this that I won&#8217;t go into but does it really matter? Windows are fairly reliable devices during the day time - you can find them just about everywhere. They maybe a little variable in size and the light coming through them might be not exactly what you want at the moment but if you go to the other side of whatever building you happen to be in it will be completely different - sun on one side shade on the other. Have the high-noon doldrums? Go inside the window light at mid-day is fantastic - all the crap is lit up outside and the light coming in through the windows is brighter than strait &#8220;north light&#8221; that comes from the sky but the effect is almost identical.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t even bother with a reflector - screw with your ratios by moving closer or farther away from the window. The shot above was done after a long day shooting with strobes - guess which ones I liked the best? Yep the simple window lit shots. Every once in a while I shot for a client - high impact, lots of lights, lots of mid tone contrast, loud images, and then a couple of quieter window lit images - every once in a while I actually included them with the full on studio stuff. Every once in a while they ended up being the images used.</p>

<p>As you can see I like a bit of contrast  and let the shadows go black - this is easy. Get really close to the window and make sure you are in a larger room, especially if it is painted white like this one. If the room is painted dark you end up with high contrast no matter what if you don&#8217;t use a reflector for fill.</p>

<p>Put away the flashes and give it a spin. You could spend a life time with just a couple of different windows at different times of day and get unbelievable results - if you get bored go ahead and through in a reflector. Someday I am going to do a lighting workshop on just window light - I wonder if anyone would come?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/2002-010-01-880.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2141" title="2002-010-01-880" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/2002-010-01-880-300x136.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="136" /></a>I know it has been a while since kodak decided to stop making TRI-X Pro 320 in medium format. I think I am one of the only people on the planet that actually still shot the stuff, most folks think of TX or TRI-X 400 when they think of TRI-X at all, well at least the stuff that comes in rolls. I think they still make the TXP in sheet film but it is soooo expensive it&#8217;s not funny and I tend to shoot subjects on sheet film that don&#8217;t really have me reaching for TXP since speed is the least of my sheet film issues, then again maybe I&#8217;ll use it for some figure studies or something.</p>

<p>I just had a little pang of regret this morning when checking up on my 120 medium format film supply and saw my one and only 5 roll pro-pack of TXP 320 sitting there all by it&#8217;s lonesome. It is less than a year old and I am sure it still looks fabulous. The regret is that I really don&#8217;t know what to do with that box. I am sort of torn. On the one hand I don&#8217;t want to just shoot it to get rid of it - I typically use it for very specific people type shots - usually high key skin where I want whites whites and more whites with a lot of separation. On the other hand I don&#8217;t want it to be sitting around 5 years and get grainy and have it&#8217;s characteristics like speed and contrast to be iffy. I am racking my brain trying to think of a project to do that will give it a proper send off. Too bad that will only last for the rest of the day and I will be thinking the same thing next month or two months from now when I look through my 120 film again.</p>

<p>For those that don&#8217;t know and never will know TXP - it is a very quirky film. Most dabblers shoot it once and think that it&#8217;s awful. I think this is mostly due to the name - TRI-X. The reality is that this film could not be more different than TRI-X 400. In fact it behaves the opposite. The &#8220;normal&#8221; TRI-X has a strait line section - meaning more linear contrast starting very early and going through the mids, the highlights tend to flatten out and shoulder off with lower and lower highlight contrast for a long time. TXP 320 on the other hand is considered by us old folk to be &#8220;all toe&#8221;. In normal people terms this means it has low shadow and mid tone contrast and starts to get linear in the highlights. If you expose this like you would most other films you will get very very blah results - this is because until you hit the upper zone 6 (a stop more than mid-grey and a little) you get very flat tones. The magic is in the right developer with the tones placed from zone 6 through zone 9 this film separates highlights fantastically with virtually no compression. When you couple that with the low shadow and mid separation it looks really really cool for some subjects but you do need to get to really &#8220;know&#8221; it.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s really hard to see the &#8220;magic&#8221; on a display medium that only covers 256 levels of brightness and a whole lot less in the range that I am talking about but the included little scan is of skin tones mostly zone 7 and higher. The negative was developed in PMK Pyro and shot at ISO 200 with a Zeiss 80mm lens.</p>

<p>Any ideas for a proper send off?</p>

<p>Kodak TXP 320 RIP.</p>
