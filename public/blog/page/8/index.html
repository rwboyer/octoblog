  <div class="entry-content"><p>A while ago <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2010/09/21/guess-what-the-cat-drug-in-a-foveon/">I bought a Sigma DP1s on a lark</a> just because the price was so so low on Amazon. At the time I paid 300 bucks for the thing brand spanking new. I wish I would have bought ten of them just to resell as it seems the price has gone back up in a big way since that time.</p>

<p>Ultimately I returned it a few days after I received it to Amazon for a refund (they are great that way). The bottom line was nice images, nice concept, <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/01/31/cameras-i-wanted-to-love-but-couldnt/">horrible execution as a camera in and of itself</a>. I still feel the same way. Fast forward a little bit and I am feeling that Foveon sensor pull me in again. I cannot seem to stop looking at some of the StupidCrap™ images that I shot on my one and only walk down the street with the DP1s. I am not considering buying another one, no way. The new SD1 seems really nice with lots and lots of Foveon goodness but the price is outrageous. Even so it seems to be sold out everywhere at the moment. Did they make 3 of them or is there really a big demand?</p>

<p>I do have about 1000 bucks in loose change laying around that was destined for a D7000 to play with but now I am somewhat crazily thinking about an SD15 for a few hundred dollars less. Am I nuts?, Gone around the bend?, I wonder&#8230;.</p>

<p>Will keep you updated with this little episode of lunacy.</p>

<p>Just a quick compare&#8230; The Foveon had a much smaller pixel dimension but was up-resed to mach the magnification.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few weeks have passed since the big iMac&#8217;s unboxing. I believe that it&#8217;s time for an update. I didn&#8217;t want to post my <em>initial</em> impressions too soon as they may be flavored with a bit too much of the infamous new Apple RDF. Yes, even I am swayed by the smell of a new Apple product and it&#8217;s new car smell perfection. Having logged full time hours on this new beast for a few weeks I can safely say that that my initial enthusiasm has not diminished.</p>

<p>I declare the new iMac to be as close to perfection as can be had at the moment. As a reminder I opted for the top of the line 27 inch core i7 model with standard hard drive, and standard 4 Gig memory configuration and standard graphics. Of course the <em>standard </em>graphics on the big boy has an exceedingly good ATI processor as well as 1 Gig of VRAM that at least doubles the performance of my last graphics card setup.</p>

<p>Immediately after placing my order for the iMac, I also ordered 16 Gigs of third party RAM from OWC. A smokin&#8217; deal at about 200 bucks. I think I will wait for the 8 Gig chips to come down to at least the same unit cost of the 4 Gig chips before contemplating an upgrade to the maximum 32 Gig configuration. I would recommend the 16 Gig configuration as a must have on this machine given the paltry price of 4 Gig chips at this point. Too bad Apple continues to gouge you on memory as shipped as it does dilute the near perfect out of box experience with the pedestrian endeavor of having to remove three screws and juggle a couple of memory chips prior basking in the LED backlit glory.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that this machine is a bargain for anyone that needs some heavy duty computing and would also like a gigantic display. I am not a heavy duty video manipulator but I can say that this new iMac trounces older MacPro&#8217;s in just about everything I have thrown at it for a fraction of the price. Be it ludicrously sized multilayer Photoshop files that contain 4000 dpi scans from medium format film, Aperture 3, batch processing of RAW files, or even Call of Duty with everything turned on - this is a very low priced ticket to stelar performance. I won&#8217;t even talk about lesser computing chores - this machine is a beast.</p>

<p>Couple the 32 Gig memory capacity, up to 2 Gig VRAM, and Thunderbolt I/O means that there are very few reasons for anyone to buy a MacPro at this point. Big memory, big graphics performance, and big storage soon to come, I cannot help but recommend that this is a serious machine that deserves serious consideration for those contemplating an upgrade. If you need a gaggle of fast local storage you may have to wait just a bit for the forthcoming Thunderbolt peripherals but when they come I am guessing that they will not disappoint and are sure to be far less expensive than anything that get&#8217;s anywhere near the performance or capacity. If you already have bigboy storage I am betting that there will be a Thunderbolt adaptor to just about anything in fairly short order considering the design and driver architecture account for this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay so I could just use words to express what is going on here but I will let this speak for itself.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/P1010837-WTF.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/P1010837-WTF.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>Now time for some words&#8230;</p>

<p>No matter what you are using to view the photo above you can see that something is amiss. You see no matter if your color managed or not, no matter if your monitor is &#8220;calibrated&#8221; or not. No matter how &#8220;off&#8221; my camera&#8217;s white balance or color is you should see the relative difference between the monitor on the left and the monitor on the right. The only two exceptions are if you are actually blind or your viewing hardware has some sort of strange rendering issue from left to right that actually corrects the issue here.</p>

<p>Now you might be saying &#8220;That&#8217;s why you calibrate monitors&#8221;. Hmmmm. This is AFTER &#8220;calibration&#8221; . If you have been at this a while you may also say &#8220;Well your calibration software merely builds a profile of what the monitor does so that the color management engine can do the best it can do with the two different devices&#8221;. Ah ha&#8230;. you are correct but MY software and calibration device have a matching mode that is SUPPOSED to at least get the neutral in gamut colors to match. You might also say &#8220;Well that&#8217;s what you get when you have two different devices that are displaying an image with out of gamut colors from an image with a larger space&#8221;  yep you&#8217;re right.</p>

<p>All of these things might be the reason but I can assure you that it is not any of those things in this case. In this case this image is well with in the native color spaces of both devices, they have been calibrated, profiles created more than once, and &#8220;matched&#8221; from a white point etc,  perspective by the hardware and software I have that is SUPPOSED to make these as good as it gets. Understand that I do not typically work like this. I don&#8217;t remember the last time that I did not use the EXACT same monitors in multi-monitor setups.</p>

<p>I rigged this up with an old 24&#8221; LED Cinema I had laying around and my new 27&#8221; iMac to try to help a reader out that is having the same exact issue. I don&#8217;t have answers yet so I am not going to name names. I do commit to do my best to get to the bottom of this and understand what is going on with this situation. If this is as good as it gets we all might want to same a few bucks on the calibration devices and software because the profiles that get built are so close to the Apple supplied profiles it&#8217;s not funny. Not only that but I can tell you that the days of &#8220;drifting&#8221; are long gone. I have not built a new profile for a monitor that has had any real difference in a long time.</p>

<p>If this is the case and the multi-hundred dollar measuring devices/software cannot get you to a matching neutral gray any better than this then why bother? Seriously. This is not real different than it looks doing absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>As I said - I am on the case and will keep you updated as to my investigations. I did go through a lot of trouble to reproduce this while eliminating all of the things I know that cause this to happen when viewing the same image on different devices. This is not intuitive and not what photographers need or want when they buy a color management solution.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yes, you probably know that.</p>

<p>On this memorial day I have to say that. Anyone that reads this that does not quite get it. Let me explain. There is nowhere on earth that is like this. Nowhere as fluid. Yes there are debates and arguments, and conflict but nowhere is there the cohesive belief of freedom, not like this.</p>

<p>I have know many marines, soldiers, pilots. Some of them gone. They are us.</p>

<p>In respect, I salute you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On two other occasions I have written posts about the crossover or art - about feeding yourself with material other than photography or even visual to inform and guide your creative process. Both of those posts went over like a cement blimp. I expect this one will as well.</p>

<p>I want to bring to light a television show, namely Treme from HBO. The show itself is middle of the pack in terms of visuals, writing, etc. Not great but not bad. The quantitative aspects of the piece are superb as are most endeavors by HBO so there will not be a huge disappointment with anything technical. What I wanted to bring to light is the music. Yes the plot line is based on the cliche of New Orleans music after Katrina but&#8230;. it is actually pretty damned good.</p>

<p>Trust me when I say that I detest anything like 9/11 art, Katrina art, or any art that capitalizes on the tragedy and celebrity of the moment. That is exactly how I felt about this programme when I first viewed it. I KNOW LA in ways that are close to me. I know Katrina in ways that are close to me, I know music in ways that are close to me. That makes me a harsh judge of other johnny come lately people. I do have to say that this show is worthwhile just fort the musical part alone. Every single episode will surprise and delight anyone with a heartbeat, with the music alone.</p>

<p>If you have never experienced New Orleans music it is a great introduction. I would be hard pressed to tell you how or who could give you a better teaser. If you think you heard it and don&#8217;t like it - you really probably have not. I do recommend the show of the musical score alone.  New Orleans music has a flavor and you will know it when you hear it but it cannot be jammed into a category because it crosses an amazing amount the normal boundaries - that is the point there are not a whole lot of boundaries to it. It is nothing like &#8220;you heard one, you heard em all&#8221;.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s go with episode number 9, If you can hear episode number 9 in musical terms alone and not be moved or brought to tears by at least one of the dozen artists represented in this episode something is very wrong with your soul or you have a taste for no music and it does not register at all in your head.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We have all heard this term, at least all of us english speaking natives. We may have even used it. I know I have on numerous occasions. For those of you reading that might not know what it means - I have an believable number of readers from around the globe - more than 40% from non-english speaking countries. That always surprises me considering my sarcasm might not translate to well&#8230; In which case that scares me into some semblance of responsibility occasionally. Back to the word &#8220;photogenic&#8221; - It means someone that looks good in photographic images. Typically it is hard to take a bad image of these people - hence the need for a word.</p>

<p>With regular old people and even some models this is usually not the case&#8230; In fact you have to work pretty hard to get a great image and even harder to get a flattering image. Some people that look fantastic in person take a lot of work to get a flattering image. Why is this? I thought about it for a long time - I ma just that way. I have not come up with an answer but I do have a few observations that have held up to be true. The first one is that some people are relaxed in front of the camera and this goes a long long way to get to the &#8220;photogenic&#8221; place. In fact it is a requirement - no relax, to much tension - not photogenic.</p>

<p>That is not the end of the story, it really isn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s only the first requirement. Then there is &#8220;prettiness&#8221;, but that doesn&#8217;t cut it. Honestly there are some people that I have shot that look far better in the images than my impression of them on the street. How can this be? Are they just meant to be shown in 2 dimensions rather than three? Maybe but that is not it. Is it because they are easy to shoot? I used to think so but have ditched that theory as my experience has shown that some of the people that I make the best images of - the ones that I find hard to make a bad image of are very very difficult to work with. For instance my daughter No. 2 - quite possibly the most frustrating photographic subject of all time but when I can actually get her in focus I have never taken an unattractive image of her.</p>

<p>They don&#8217;t have to be hard to shoot, I have some models that I work with and it is a cake walk in every way. So photogenic does not mean easy or hard to work with. Is it just the way the person is - they always look great in photographs? Typically yes - they do but having taken about ten million pictures I can tell you that there is something about the relationship of the photographer to the subject that affects &#8220;photogenic-ness&#8221; of the subject. I have shot people that seemingly could be and are described as photogenic buy some of my colleagues that look like crap when I shoot them and vis-a-versa. Then let&#8217;s take daughter No. 2 again - I can&#8217;t take a bad image of her and a lot of other people can&#8217;t either. I have seen the results - amateur to pro but then again I have seen school photographers take horrible images of her as well.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that photogenic is not only the subject, there is some degree of influence of the photographer that causes the photogenic to happen on a subconscious level. I might have to take a few years sabbatical to be able to quantify it any more than that. I am still intrigued by the effect of photogenic subjects and why they exist in some symbiotic relationship with the photographers that find it impossible to take bad images of them.</p>

<p>For your consideration here is an image that I randomly jammed up on my Hasselblad online portfolio. It has been wildly popular and caused me to receive quite a few emails from fellow photographers with questions about it. I chose this image at random - I happened to have a jpeg already, it was square, I shot it with my Hasselblad, and I have been intrigued with this image for years. Intrigued because there are so many technical and aesthetic flaws that they have stopped me from ever making a final print of this negative but&#8230; I still like it. In fact it is one of those images that makes me think about what photogenic is. Despite the flaws and the distortions caused by the haphazard way her hands are twisting her face, and her eyes being semi-closed, and an unflattering angle, and countless other issues - I cannot seem to make an unattractive image of this subject.</p>

<p>What is photogenic? Why are some people photogenic in front of your camera? If you are not a native english speaker - do you have a word for this effect?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.smogranch.com/">Daniel Milnor put me onto this video interview</a> with Australian photojournalists. I rarely pass this kind of stuff on but I think this is worth a look. If you are into photojournalistic or documentary photography you will find this extremely interesting.  The other reason that I wanted to share it with all of you is because of two things that I found interesting about all of these photographers along with a strange coincidence you will all be familiar with. The first thing is that every one of these photographers shoots film for their personal projects. Not one of them - ALL OF THEM. This is a common phenomenon in Japan and one of the reasons that I follow japanese photography. I had no idea this was a trend in Australia - is it? Either way remember the <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/03/15/we-have-a-winner-the-nikon-f3/">Nikon F3 giveaway I had a month or so ago</a>?  Strangely enough <a href="http://www.gabrielponzanelli.com/">Gabriel</a>, the lucky reader that won the F3 is an Australian - go figure - strange. Wonder if these guys had some subliminal influence on his entry to the giveaway? If you check out the link for Gabriel you will find his first couple shots with the F3 - cooooool. I have been meaning to do a follow up with him to get his impressions of using the ancient beast but the time zone differences have foiled us. I will make it a priority.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Man when I go on a buying spree I do it right. You know about the iMac 27&#8221; right? Well seems I can not just stop clicking that &#8220;buy now button&#8221;&#8230; So I bought a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042X9LC4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=B0042X9LC4">Nikon D7000</a>. I have no idea why I did this, really I don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s not my usual top notch rationalization skills. It was purely a reflex of clicking on stuff that might be interesting. I guess it is curiosity. There are so many people saying how wonderful this thing is I guess I had to get one and compare it to say a D3, D700, and D300s.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll let you know how it goes in a few days or week-ish. There is a 90% chance I will get bored with it in about a month and chuck it in the closet for about 6 months. This happens a lot with me - especially with digital stuff. It is strange how I have most of the film cameras that I ever had - well at least the one&#8217;s I liked a lot.</p>

<p>While I was clicking and clicking and clicking I also found another thing that I just gotta have. A <a href="http://www.hasselbladusa.com/products/digital-backs/cfv-39.aspx">Hasselblad CFV</a> digital back for all my wonderful Hasselblad gear that I still use. It&#8217;s been a while since I was able to tether a medium format camera when shooting people/fashion. I sold my H2D long ago when I got out of the commercial photo business. Since then my medium format dabbling has been with my good ole&#8217; 500 series stuff - aka &#8220;The V System&#8221;. So a few months ago I saw some files from the CFV up close and personal and was very much blown away. I might have to have one of these backs. I swear they were as good as the files from the Leaf back I had on my H2D - seriously.</p>

<p>On that note I am selling off some gear to fund a tiny portion and make some shelf space for the CFV assuming I cannot resist getting one for more than a couple days or weeks. - The last Pro DSLR is gone, sold locally (well I still have my beater D2H and D2x&#8217;s but they don&#8217;t count they are old. The next item up for sale is some of my micro four thirds gear. I really like it but I have way way way too much stuff and a hankering for big boy stuff. <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=180670217992&amp;ssPageName=ADME:L:LCA:US:1123#ht_500wt_1030">If you want a perfect GF-1 with 20mm 1.7 check it out</a>. I am sure it won&#8217;t last I price my stuff below market and deliver better than expected gear.</p>

<p>Oh, the camera company part&#8230; Well the one nice thing that I can say about buying from a &#8220;niche&#8221; high end camera company like Hasselblad, Zeiss, Schneider, Leaf, Phase One, etc. Is they actually support you. I could tell you amazing stories about how wonderful these companies have been to me as a customer and a pro over the years. They bend over backwards to get you info, support your purchase decisions, service their old gear. My buddy Les has now experienced this with his recently purchased Schneider lenses that are 10 years old, His Arca Swiss 4x5, etc, etc. Unlike a lot of the camera giants out there like &#8220;Nikon&#8221; - heck they won&#8217;t even let me be a member of &#8220;Club NPS&#8221; FOR A FEEEE because I haven&#8217;t purchased big ticket items in like 2 years. Yea right. Hasselblad bends over backwards to want to support me as a customer and I don&#8217;t even have to &#8220;prove&#8221; that I own their stuff. Heck they even let me in to their club - <a href="http://www.hasselblad.com/hoc/photographers/robert-boyer.aspx">check out my page</a>&#8230; Looks pretty good for randomly chucking up some jpegs lying around my desktop.</p>

<p>I have no idea why we put up with the likes of Nikon and Canon - If you are a working pro they suck - I guess they are fantastic if you are a Rockstar but south of that - not really. Don&#8217;t get me wrong NPS is great relatively speaking but I forgot how wonderful it is dealing with a &#8220;premium&#8221; company, I haven&#8217;t really done that in over 5 years and it is refreshing. It might even be worth the idiotic prices for their products.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You may not have picked up on this but over the course of my computing life time I have always gravitated to smaller and smaller footprint devices but have not wanted a whole lot of compromise when doing so. Apple products have consistently allowed me to do so in ways other companies have not allowed me to do. Do I care about the price - sure I do but more from an overall value perspective than a flat out lowest possible cost.</p>

<p>Apple had 1 Gig ethernet across their product line YEARS before it was in other products. 802.11x - same deal. Firewire - same. etc, etc. When it comes to hardware 2 years or so has been about the lifetime I expect before it makes more sense to upgrade the whole works for me. Maybe that will stay that way maybe not but here is the deal. For the stuff that I face off with I want it to be small, beautiful, fast, and pleasant to do business with hour after hour. I never have relished the thought of having a giant piece of equipment with all the associated crap, heat, noise, etc in my face. I rather that part of my computing universe out of sight and out of mind - preferably in a different, dark room somewhere I am not. I have successfully - in varying degrees been able to do this with Gig-e and 10 Gig-e with a bunch of custom built storage arrays, some switches, a bunch of software that I understand very well and other moving parts. Very soon I will not have to worry about the care and feeding of that stuff - or at least not have the overhead of assembling it and maintaining the software. That is why my Alien Technology SAN product is on hold for a while - ever since Apple adopted Thunderbolt IO ports in the MacBookPro&#8217;s. This is a HUGE development that solves my appetite for huge fast storage that doesn&#8217;t have to sit in a box right next to me.</p>

<p>Leaving out the DisplayPort stuff, Thunderbolt IO is pretty much PCI-express that can be carried over a wire somewhere else. This means that you can buy something that connects Thunderbolt to pretty much ANYTHING. This is a big deal and I am certain that vendors are going to be jumping on this in a big way sooner or later. Hence I want to wait until I see what the market is providing before I put time and energy into a complicated solution for the rest of you. If there are gaps I do plan on filling them but for now this is the direction I am going.</p>

<p>Now - why the iMac - why now. You can probably tell I am not a big fan of sitting next to a MacPro. It is a fantastic machine but give me back the space and flexibility in my work-area anytime. Along with the peace quiet. I tend to try to balance my equipment purchases for two things. The first is step functions. The newest sandy bridge i5/i7 processors are step functions not a minor bump of the same thing I have. Thunderbolt IO is a step function. The new Graphics subsystems with the amount of GDDR they support are step functions.  All in all looking at the Apple line up - todays&#8217; MacBookPro and iMac&#8217;s are a far better purchase in how much more you get relative to the previous gen vs the same comparison last year.</p>

<p>The second thing I try to do is get on the trailing edge/leading edge of price/performance. In this case RAM. 8Gig chips are new and big time expensive. 4Gig chips used to be that way but are now the best buy in terms of capacity vs price. Here is what I mean - 16Gigs of RAM for the new iMac using 4Gig chips costs $200. 16Gigs of RAM for the same machine using 8Gig chips cost a whopping - $1500. Which way do you think I am going?</p>

<p>You might say &#8220;But you will have to get 8Gig to go to 32gigs and if you go with the 8Gig you won&#8217;t have to throw them away&#8221; - Who cares - If I wait for the 8Gig chips to come down in parity from a price/gig then I &#8220;throw away&#8221; $200 vis $1300 as compared to getting the same 16gig now using 8gig chips and upgrading later. The only way I would buy the highest capacity chips now is if I absolutely NEEDED 32Gig because the cost/gig is at such a premium.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that Now is one of the great times to buy a MacBookPro or iMac and get the most life out of it and the performance benefits along with dirt cheap 4 Gig chips as compared to say 12 months from now. Yea maybe they will be a little faster but not compared to todays iMacs vs last years.</p>

<p>No one knows what the future holds but based on a well established pattern of intel and Apple this looks like the sweet spot if you are looking for a new machine. Trust me - I have timed things like this for years with tech curves of all sorts and the iMac/MacBook of today will allow the next two or three revisions to be &#8220;who cares&#8221; for you until the next step function.</p>

<p>If all this techno mumble doesn&#8217;t make sense use the &#8220;Holy Shit&#8221; rule of thumb. These new 2011 sandy bridge &#8220;consumer&#8221; machines are in the Holy Shit category compared to the last gen machines.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every 12 months or so I get the itch for some new Mac gear. It&#8217;s been a little less time since I got my MacBook Air - the 11&#8221; jobby. I am still loving it and my 15&#8221; MacBook Pro has not left the building in since I got it. So&#8230; what should I get? You might say something like &#8220;why get anything?&#8221;. Well ever since the Sandy Bridge intel Macs came out I have had a craving. Big time.</p>

<p>As you probably have surmised I prefer &#8220;little macs&#8221; hooked to big screens for most of my work so naturally I was looking at the super-duper new Sandy Bridge 15&#8221; MacBook Pro to replace my year and some months old 15&#8221; but&#8230; I swear it never leaves the house since the MacBook Air. Here is what I am ordering next week for my primary use machine while at home. Seems like it will give me great performance  and TWO 27&#8221; screens.</p>

<ul>
    <li>New top end 27&#8221; iMac</li>
    <li>3.4Ghz Core i7 upgrade</li>
    <li>16G RAM / 1G VRAM</li>
</ul>


<p>I decided to do this because of two things. The first is that I will then have two new 27&#8221; Cinema displays vs One connected to the 15&#8221; MacBook Pro for about the same money as maxing out a new 15&#8221;. The second being that my irrational aversion to the iMacs seems to have melted away with the advent of Thunderbolt IO in the new Sandy Bridge intel iMacs. In the past having the IO limitations of a laptop saddled with a desktop form factor just was something that hit a sour note for my purposes. Yea Yea I know the new MacBook Pro&#8217;s have a Thunderbolt as well but now that the iMac does and the quad core i7 model should shred an older MacPro I am more comfortable with that choice.</p>

<p>Any thoughts? I will let you know how it goes and how it compares real world to a MacPro that is well fitted out but getting a little long in tooth.</p>
