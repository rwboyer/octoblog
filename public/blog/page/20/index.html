  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/delta100-pyro.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2332 alignleft" title="delta100-pyro" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/delta100-pyro-300x239.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="239" /></a>Here is a really lousy shot from one of my 9 year old Delta 100 rolls that I found a while back. I have been using it to shoot &#8220;stupid stuff&#8221;. Sort of what I use digital for in a lot of cases. I am a big advocate of shooting stupid stuff. You know - the kind of stuff you know won&#8217;t work but it&#8217;s fun anyway.</p>

<p>Anyway I wanted to demonstrate something regarding Pyro developers that you really have to see for yourself but I find fairly cool. Whenever there are storms coming or going the birds around here get nuts. They fly around and land. Then they explode and go somewhere else. When the wind is blowing they go at like 60 MPH. Hence why they are a little blurry. Anyway - I had a bunch of stupid stuff on this roll and was planning on developing the whole thing at N+ because of the subject matter. Then I shot this - I shot it the same way I would have shot anything else that day, same exposure, meaning the sky was off the charts in terms of brightness and exposure. Heck it was the light source - so I shot the light source at the same exposure you would use for stuff lit by the light source. On my contact sheets it showed up as expected, pure white.</p>

<p>Now here is where the cool part comes in. I still developed the roll at N+ (high contrast) which put the sky in this scene even further into the woods but looking at the negative I could see there was some tonal variations. What to do? I just printed it down and look ma, great differentiation in the clouds. I swear without a lot of attention the sky that day seemed just plain grey with not a bunch of cool clouds. As they say the camera does see more than the eye.</p>

<p>Now this part is where you have to trust me when I say this is what &#8220;they&#8221; are talking about when people rave about highlight differentiation vs other developers. Trust me if you use say&#8230; D-76, which is perfectly fine and put big parts of your image in say zone IX they you over develop it and try to print down or burn in that area what you will end up with is blah grey instead of pure white with not a whole lot of tonal separation. This is why I like pyro developers. I can develop the crap out of the negative for good local contrast (similar to Rodinal) and still be able to print down or burn in highlights with lots of separation. Very cool.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9040276-Version-2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2316" title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9040276-Version-2-300x136.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="136" /></a>I decided to play around and shoot something today that I have never shot before. Butterflies. Nothing special but I did have a purpose. I really wanted to build up my confidence in the E-P1 focusing system from a speed and accuracy standpoint. I am paranoid about such things. Not overly so but I do like to know what to expect and what limitations I am working with. The photo at the top is a crop of the full width of the out of camera jpg. No messing around - settings were &#8220;normal&#8221; all the way around. I did use the choose your own autofocus point but I wasn&#8217;t especially careful. Auto WB and exposure did the heavy lifting. I just got as close as I could without scaring the little critters away. They are a bit more skittish than I imagined.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s the verdict? I would say it is workable. Wouldn&#8217;t you? Take a look at the weather report for the east coast mid-atlantic area today. I shot these with the butterflies moving as normal - they are not dead and with 15 MPH wind knocking both butterfly and branch about. I am right on the water so there really isn&#8217;t any respite from wind to speak of. Just so you don&#8217;t think it was a fluke here are a couple of &#8220;100% crops&#8221;. Strait out of the camera! No shit. I did shoot about 20 images and I would say 90% were fine in terms of focus accuracy and speed. I did blow two or three but I could blame me at least as much as the camera&#8217;s systems. Like I said, you would think this thing is a complete dog when you read the reviews regarding AF speed but if you can&#8217;t nail 90% of things you might want to shoot you are probably pretty much hopeless with any camera.</p>

<p>Does this thing make beautiful JPEG&#8217;s or what?</p>

<p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9040276-Version-3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2317" title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9040276-Version-3-300x240.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="240" /></a></p>

<p>Click on the image to see them in all their pixel peeping glory. Be sure to make sure the lightbox is showing you everything - there is an icon in the upper right corner to see everything if the lightbox is scaling it. These things have been JPG compressed like 4 times each via the camera, export from Aperture, import into Wordpress, and resizing for the small display sizes. Sheesh.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9020184-880.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2308" title="P9020184-880" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9020184-880-300x136.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="136" /></a>About 4 people have asked me off-line &#8220;what about the focusing?&#8221;. I don&#8217;t have enough real world experience to say one way or another if it is going to work for me. I can say that it&#8217;s not horrible. You can put it in a mode where the camera decides and that&#8217;s not bad or you can put it in a mode where you decide the focus point. Both seem useful. Both seem pretty quick in situations that I am likely to actually want to make images. It focuses fine in situations where I need image stabilization at 1600 ISO at f 3.5 so that is probably fine.</p>

<p>I can tell you that the way continuous auto focus works is annoying. I won&#8217;t describe it and I have no idea if it works in reality but I probably won&#8217;t really use it. It&#8217;s noisy, disconcerting, and you have to trust that it&#8217;s going to work. Not really what this camera is for in my mind. I&#8217;ll test it soon just to see. I am probably not going to use continuous shooting either. Just like I have no desire to put a motor on my Leica M cameras.</p>

<p>The manual+single AF is actually very useful on the E-P1 once you get used to it. when you turn the focus ring on the lens the camera automatically zooms in on the focus area that was used for the AF in the first place. In situations where you are likely to need that kind of precision verification (not happening real fast) It&#8217;s not a whole lot different than using my D3 with AF+Manual. Just remember you have to keep the shutter pressed in half way while doing the manual adjustment or it will refocus when you take the shot. You can decouple the focus from the shutter and use the AE/AF lock button to focus instead of the shutter release but in practicality that has not proven very effective for me on this camera (it is on my Nikons but for some reason - maybe the buttons are too small, it&#8217;s no on this one).</p>

<p>If you are &#8220;testing&#8221; this camera you may find it annoying that the auto focus areas are so large. The reality is that inside that large focus area the camera chooses a really really small focus area - about as small as the 53 area mode on a Nikon. You just can&#8217;t pick them yourself. I say you might find it annoying in that you are surprised by what tiny point was actually used vs what you wanted if you use the AF on really close up stuff where you wanted the tiny area to be different than what the camera chose. That is what the manual+AF mode is really for. If you are at more normal subject distances it probably doesn&#8217;t matter a whole lot.</p>

<p>Olympus says that it focuses on the closest thing within the AF area box. In reality it seems to be random if there are multiple things all at similar focus distances with in the displayed focus area. Like I said - you can play &#8220;gotta&#8221; and be annoyed with testing or you can take pictures and see how they turn out. If you are really close up use the manual override to see or use that zoom view mode. The image at the top was real close to minimum focus at the longest zoom setting at the widest Aperture. This is a 100% crop. I just selected the focus area and let the camera do it&#8217;s thing. The sharpening was set to &#8220;normal&#8221; for this out of camera JPEG.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9020172-880.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2305" title="P9020172-880" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9020172-880-300x136.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="136" /></a>Yea some new cameras are cool to. In fact that little E-P1 Olympus qualifies so far as a cool camera. I bought is for all the reasons that I gave. Small, carry it anywhere. No guilty feeling that the image quality is inherently poor (like most P+S). In other words to get over my own hang-ups about small digital cameras. I am keeping it because it seems to do a reasonable job and fits the bill to jamb in the bag with my Leica cameras. Heck worst case is that it is the worlds most sophisticated light meter. Well at least for ambient light. The other reason I am keeping it is it is just so friggin cool. I really don&#8217;t mind using it in the same way I minded using other small digicams I have picked up over the years.</p>

<p>So what about old cameras. A lot of old cameras are really really cool to use, to look at, to fiddle with. Throw on top of that the fact that the image quality is great and what is there not to like. Take the image at the top. This is the view into one of my old battered Rolleiflex TLR&#8217;s. It still works. Makes great images on 120 film of any type. Simple. Small. I could chuck this in the bag with the M&#8217;s as well. In fact I have on occasion. I took this image with my new &#8220;cool&#8221; camera. Would I have bothered taking it if I had to get out the Macro and stand on a ladder to do it? No.</p>

<p>Come on - you have to admit that pictured camera is cool, just from looking at the stupid snap shot. I thought I would share that but I also do have a point. I have been thinking a little bit about this since I got the E-P1 and started playing with it. This is really one of the first digital cameras that I have owned that I thought was a blast to use. It&#8217;s also one of the first ones that I have found that just has a cool factor to it. I really really hope that this trend continues. I mean come on Tell me a digital camera in the same kind of vain as the Rollei with a big sensor and easy to use simple controls that looks great with a giant sensor wouldn&#8217;t be really really cool.</p>

<p>Yea, Yea I know it doesn&#8217;t really matter - that&#8217;s what everyone loves to say about gear. I say bullshit. If that were true people wouldn&#8217;t by different cameras. I know in my logical mind that I can pretty much use just about any camera to make just about any image I want. In my heart there are certain cameras over the years that I just LOVED to use. My images from those cameras show it as well. There is definitely something to be said for the cool factor. Aren&#8217;t you glad Apple invented cool looking/working/functional computers. I loved my PowerBook Ti. Aren&#8217;t you glad the iPod has always been so stinking cool looking. Don&#8217;t you love to play with it. Have you seen the new &#8220;touch nano&#8221;.</p>

<p>I really really hope that more manufactures will jump on board with the camera as cool / nice / good looking / love to hold / fun to use device on top of image quality. I don&#8217;t mean different stupid colors. I mean nice materials, nice design, functional, industrial art that happen to be great at what they do - making pictures.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9020210-880.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2312" title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9020210-880-300x136.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="136" /></a>I was having a conversation with a Photographer buddy of mine and fellow Aperture users a few days ago and something hit me. I spend a lot of time criticizing Aperture &#8216;s RAW processing specifically related to NEF files. To be blunt I haven&#8217;t criticized other RAW formats because by and large they don&#8217;t suffer the same fate as NEF&#8217;s. So I guess what I don&#8217;t discuss a lot is why the NEF processing doesn&#8217;t cause me to jump ship back to NX2 or Lightroom.</p>

<p>You might take it from context that I prefer so many other things about Aperture that I &#8220;put up with it&#8221; and &#8220;work around it&#8217;s shortcomings&#8221;. Yes that&#8217;s true but what you might not get is that I actually use a lot of JPEG&#8217;s as is that are produced by my camera. I almost always shoot RAW+JPEG but I would say 90% of the time I actually just end up using the JPEG. I don&#8217;t spend any time thinking about this, I don&#8217;t compare the RAWs and the JPEGs, I don&#8217;t do lots of tests of this vs that. I only use the RAWs if I have a specific reason to do so. Sometimes I know that before I shoot and sometimes I know it afterwards.</p>

<p>Specific color treatments - RAW. Extracting shadow detail or highlights that are a little hot - RAW. Huge contrast manipulations - RAW. Heavy retouch (Photoshop) - RAW. Shoot it. Like it. Done with it. JPEG. I really like shooting JPEGs. It reminds me of shooting slide film. You shoot it and you are done. You have what you have.</p>

<p>Most cameras out there have crazy ranges of what your JPEGs will look like out of the camera - from mild to wild. Pick a look and go with it. I am telling you it is freedom. Stop worrying so so much if you can &#8220;make it better&#8221;, if you like the image be done with it. Use the JPEG.</p>

<p>That brings us to Aperture 3, it has some killer features for JPEG+RAW shooters. My favorite is importing JPEG only. Getting rid of the rejects and then using the &#8220;Import matching RAW&#8221; function. This only imports the RAWs of the JPEG&#8217;s that you actually kept. It&#8217;s easy to use and really saves a lot of time and space. For those of you that primarily use your JPEG&#8217;s but shoot RAW+JPEG for some future archival reason, or just in case (like I do most of the time) this function is fantastic. It also allows you to turn around your JPEG&#8217;s really quick. You know how fast JPEGs import? Really fast.</p>

<p>Try it - you don&#8217;t have to give up having your RAW files but you also don&#8217;t have to be a slave to them.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. Yesterday the whole day was crappy hazy smoggy hazy - bland blah. Two seconds after the sun went down there was this sky. To bad for me I was on my upstairs deck with nothing to shoot with it as a background. Now&#8230; If I would have gone somewhere and waited - there would not have been a sky. Trust me I tried this like 4 whole times and gave up the whole landscape thing.I guess you have to try it some more.</p>

Too distracted with other things. Maybe I&#8217;ll make it out of the house this evening. Of course I have snapped off a few stupid ugly shots of nothing just to see how it works. I can tell you that I have no hesitation shooting this thing at ISO 800 and not much at ISO 1600. Higher speeds are more of a must have the shot at all cost affairs - they are not wonderful. On the other hand if I shoot them with the grainy black and white &#8220;art&#8221; filter that people seem to like so much who cares, you can&#8217;t tell what ISO they were shot at. I will probably use that methodology in real life when forced to shoot at 3200 or 6400.</p>

<p>As for low shutter speeds. I can say I also have a lot of confidence in the built in image stabilization. It works at the top is a shot that wasn&#8217;t particularly carefully shot. It was at ISO 800 1/6 second f 4.5 or thereabouts - the focal length was equivalent to a 50mm on full-frame. I don&#8217;t even remember where the camera focused it was on &#8220;choose for you mode&#8221; 1/6 of a second after about 9 coffees today, holding it with my arms extended shooting downwards vs against my body. I would say the image stabilization works pretty darn good. This JPEG is resized right out of camera with all of the settings &#8220;flat&#8221;. All things being equal my next lens is that Panasonic 20mm f/1.7. This thing is fun.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hmmm, maybe that&#8217;s not a good title. How about world&#8217;s least informative article.  I am lost here, I have no idea why I even bother reading things from the &#8220;big names&#8221; in just about anything any more. <a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/pdn/content_display/ask-the-experts/e3id2408305f8fc7155edb74809630c1a81">Here is an &#8220;article&#8221; by PDN interviewing a well known fashion photographer</a>. Take a glance - actually read it, don&#8217;t be lazy it will only take you about 15 seconds.</p>

<p>Okay - here is the quiz. What did you learn? I hope not much, if you did god help us all. I learned something. If you want to be a big time fashion photographer you gotta gotta use SanDisk cards because they come with magic software, you need to buy Profoto and Broncolor lights and yo need to use a bunch of different stuff all mixed up depending on what mood your in but never just one.</p>

<p>Got it. Ten four. WTF?</p>

<p>Have you noticed that just about every &#8220;big name&#8221; publication on the planet is getting this way. Not just about photography. I mean all of the dead tree based media outlets. This is pitiful. Is this kind of trite nonsense supposed to be some incentive to maybe renew my long expired subscription to PDN. Is it some kind  of reverse psychology or something? Sort of &#8220;all the stuff we write on the web is shit so the stuff on paper must be better&#8221;. Oh okay where do I sign up.</p>

<p>This is pitiful.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSC_0188.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2290" title="DSC_0188" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSC_0188-300x198.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198" /></a>Our friend Kamil, Phd candidate, Aperture user?, 5D shooter, and proud new E-P1 owner is coming to the USA. He wants to know two things? What to shoot in NYC and where to go to see some good photography in NYC? Is there a short list? I certainly have my list but I never do, see, or shoot the same thing twice in NYC. The pic at the top shows a guy that I bought some photos/art from the 4 matched original crappy framed images on the top - the sort of fashion abstracts are what I bought for $10 a while ago. He sells purses to. My GF at the time bought a Marc Jacobs Yellow knock-off, was all the rage at that point.</p>

<p>Any way I thought some of you might want to chime in here. I have about 10,000 or more NYCimages. Some fantastic. I really do not feel like going through them for examples. I mean<a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSC_0006.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2295" title="DSC_0006" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DSC_0006-300x198.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198" /></a>where do you start? I cannot possibly be succinct so do you guys have a short list? Here is my old view of central park from the 20th floor. Loved that place. Here is my old GF, she was a bit focused can you pick her out of the crowd. I swear you can lift your camera and shoot just about anywhere and make a decent shot. It&#8217;s overwhelming.</p>

<p>So let&#8217;s help him out - should he start with some galleries or museum mile?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/P8310023-880.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2286" title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/P8310023-880-300x136.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="136" /></a>That was quick - like two days. Anyway the UPS man showed up and here it is. I tore it out of the box slammed the battery in and guess what? No SD cards - yes I know you have to buy them, I ordered a couple of 8GB cards the same day, maybe they&#8217;ll be here later. I did scrounge up an ancient 256MB SD card at the bottom of a drawer and shot of couple of grab shots to make sure it worked. So here is my first couple impressions - way more later.</p>

<ol>
    <li>It&#8217;s not going back - I love this little camera.</li>
    <li>The AF is not anything like a crappy point and shoot. If you can&#8217;t nail a shot with this in normal light you suck. Have none of the mamby-pamby&#8217;s ever shot MF before - WTF.</li>
    <li>Shutter lag or lack there of is great. Really it&#8217;s great, I have no issue with this thing taking the picture when I tell it to.</li>
    <li>Stupid ass mode makes most of the buttons not work as if you are going to hurt yourself if the freaking AE lock worked so it&#8217;s less useful than it could be. I guess I will reserve that for when I am drunk.</li>
    <li>In non-drunk mode like A or P or even M it is great. I haven&#8217;t even had 10 minutes to figure out all the custom ways you can set it up. More later, I am sure I will have some recommendations. The only think I set up is single + manual focus mode which is great and made the AE lock button sticky, I wish it wouldn&#8217;t clear after the shot but hey.</li>
    <li>The out of camera JPEG is some of the best I have ever seen - Olympus has a flair for their JPEG engines and this is their best yet. Really. Of course I will probably shoot RAW+JPEG but I love the JPEGs and will probably use them as is. You can fine tune the crap out of them in camera with settings as well as use Oly&#8217;s pre baked. They are good.</li>
    <li>Auto WB is great - also fine tune-able as is exposure in every mode.</li>
    <li>The kit lens seems useful. I can&#8217;t wait to try some other ones.The people that complain about this lens which is pretty much free (body only costs only a fraction less - I won&#8217;t even bother trying to piece it out if I end up getting an E-P2. Heck even at 300 bucks stand-alone it&#8217;s pretty cool. The idiots that complain that it collapses and it takes to long to manually collapse and open it are idiots. You don&#8217;t have to wait for some wimpy motor to wind it in and out. I like how compact it folds up.</li>
    <li>DOF wide open can still give you some good effects - I was worried about this on a M43 sensor.</li>
    <li>This is a great looking camera that looks and feels like a million bucks for 300 and some change.</li>
    <li>Buttons are a little small for my stupid-big hands but workable.</li>
    <li>Video looks fantastic at first glance. To be honest i ignored all the AF complaints about the video because they were all related to continuous focus tracking. Are you kidding me? Get real do you think real videos are made with AF and continuous tracking? Use your iPhone for gods sake it&#8217;s fine if you want a crappy looking handheld AF video. Real video is MF and the focus isn&#8217;t changing all over the place quickly. More on this later. I do know a thing or three about motion media from a previous life.</li>
</ol>


<p>Too bad it&#8217;s mid-day noon crappy hazy hot sun. I&#8217;ll have to charge the battery and go shooting later for a better report on performance. In any mode but drunk-mode this thing handles a lot like a DSLR shift it around with the dials. There are plenty of dedicated buttons to shift around common things. Live mode adjustments are quick and easy and have nothing to do with the buttons - it is very workable compared to most point and shoots.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t wait to figure out how to customized some of the memories with my preferred settings. Thank god that is pretty much the only reason to ever go into the menus - the instruction manual is worthless. You know how when you read to yourself you hear your voice, or maybe someone else&#8217;s like the imagined character. When you read this manual you will hear the South Park chinese guy, at least I do. There are a couple of custom memories you can setup, you can fine tune all of the picture &#8220;look&#8221; presets, you can have your own picture look custom preset, heck you can even have color filters and tints to the OOC black and white JPG&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Very cool - I do want a viewfinder but I am going to struggle along with just the live view screen for at least a couple months to get used to it. I told you I have never owned a point and shoot. I want to get rid of my bias so I can really be objective about viewfinder vs screen. If I had a viewfinder right now I would never use the screen.</p>

<p>Okay - the image at the top is a 100% view of the very very very first image ever shot on this camera. Auto WB, natural color mode, ISO 200, AE lock, AF, all the way wide, P mode w/ program shift to max Aperture jammed into a flower pot with the sky in the background. Yea I can use this thing.</p>

<p>More later - I have to play.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/DSC0007-moo.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2280" title="DSC0007-moo" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/DSC0007-moo-300x120.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="120" /></a>Let me say if you are a photographer and you are not using Moo products you have to be crazy. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you are the family photographer, a top of the game, wedding shooter, commercial, travel, landscape, whatever. Use them. For that matter even if you are not a photographer they are amazing. Come-on 50 or 100 high quality images with two sides of printing for 20 bucks depending on what size you order? Just do it.</p>

<p>Okay here are some things to think about if you haven&#8217;t used Moo before or even if you have there might be something here for you. I know - I sound like an advertisement. I get that way when I love a product. First off most of you know this but let me cover the basics for those that haven&#8217;t used them before, then I will get into some finer points for the experts. You get as many different images as cards you buy. Buy 100 cards and get 100 different images. You don&#8217;t have to have 100 different images, you can have one, or 4 card each of 25. It all depends on how many images you upload. That&#8217;s on one side. On the other there is a little easy to use designer on the Moo website to put in some text and a logo image and change the color and font and layout around. That other side will be the same on every card.</p>

<p>If you are just starting out use the easy way. Upload your images, leave all the defaults on (like auto-enhance). Design your static second side (you can even make the background of the second side a color that is full bleed). You&#8217;re done. They look great. I swear I order at least a box of them a month. People love them when they see that they are all different. They tend to keep them too. If you go for the full size business cards the aspect ratio is pretty much the same as 3:2 or your typical DSLR so full-frame images with no crop are fine. You can be very creative with the crops you only need 1039 pixels on the long side for 300dpi and they look fine at half that.</p>

<p>If you go for the mini-cards, my personal favorite, you have to be a bit more adventurous The aspect ratio os a wide or tall pano of 2.5:1. You are way better off applying a crop in Aperture to pre-visualize while you are selecting your images prior to upload. Go ahead and use that ratio to pre-visualize but don&#8217;t export and upload that if you are just starting out. Just upload and use Moo&#8217;s cropper. If you want to pre-crop prior to upload you will need to account for bleed and the dimensions are slightly different. The included image at the top of the post is probably about the actual size of a mini-card, I did a search for yellow in my Aperture library and this was the very first image that came up. Shot in 2005 on a 4 Megapixel camera in one of my workshops. I cropped a pano that is not even full width out of a portrait image and there is still more than enough resolution for max quality at that size.</p>

<p>Some general advice is to pick your images while looking at thumbnails of roughly the same size as the cards, maybe even a hair smaller. You would be surprised at how some images either work at a small size or not. Don&#8217;t be afraid of the mini-cards, almost any image can work you just have to be bold on the cropping. The are tiny so you can really crop in if you want. In many cases things you think are going to work as full size images in that pano don&#8217;t work The detail is too small for a wide vista of a landscape unless it is rally graphic. When being bold don&#8217;t rule out a crop that is opposite they way the full size image is shot. In other words a landscape crop on a portrait image and vis a vis.</p>

<p>For you more advanced types out there you can have full control of the layout on both sides of the card as well as text on the front size. Just about anything you can imagine. Just upload PDF&#8217;s instead of JPEGs. To be honest Photoshop and InDesign are the tools of choice and are actually easier for this if you know how to use them. If you don&#8217;t Aperture&#8217;s book tool is perfectly capable of laying out a card design. The trick to using Aperture is to get the custom book layouts to the correct dimensions. If you go back and look at a couple of the posts on Aperture&#8217;s book tool here you&#8217;ll know what to do. The other thing you probably want to do is setup your own PDF export service vs. the Apple default. If you go this route TURN OFF image auto-enhance it can do some strange things to your text layouts and simulated spot color.</p>

<p>So what do you use these for besides your typical mini-portfolio or more interesting business card. Here are a couple of things you might think about:</p>

<ul>
    <li>For portrait, event, architecture, commercial product, and wedding photographers - use them as give-aways. Take your selects and order a whole box of one shoot for one client. A nice surprise gift. Be creative with the back of the card and make it relevant for the client but don&#8217;t for get your logo. The boxes these things are so nice you won&#8217;t believe it. Add a silk ribbon and it may look better than the &#8220;real&#8221; product you are currently delivering. Client happy = you happy + built in advertising. Do you think they won&#8217;t give them away for you?</li>
    <li>Do you have a product? Maybe some sort of craft product - use them as hang tags.</li>
    <li>Use them as mini advertisements or comp cards for a very specific event/gallery showing/open-house/make-up party/tupperware party whatever. One hundred for 20 bucks.</li>
    <li>Use them as really nice raffle tickets - I am not kidding here. Stick a number on the front with a photo if you want and use them to draw people to your event - everybody like the chance to win something. Hey maybe they will win one of your prints.</li>
    <li>Make a montage - I actually got this idea from Moo. They sell a great looking frame that allows you to arrange mini-cards in a structured but free form way that is really cool. I happen to tag all of my images with a predominant color. Typically whatever my first impression is red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, magenta. This way I can search by color and theme and make some really cool art with the cards themselves.</li>
    <li>Sell them as a product to your existing clients. If you can&#8217;t see a way to make images of your clients products work using this product you need some serious creative enhancement! Of course you get to do the photography and design. Catering business? Hmmm can you see how your catering friend/client/wife might use these?</li>
</ul>


<p>I could go on forever - I told you I order a box of these a month for myself. It&#8217;s fun - 20 bucks. I know you Greenpeace guys will hate me for this but I like the Non-green cards better. I will try to use the &#8220;green&#8221; version that are actually more expensive for a crappier paper/no coating for a more subtle set of images when I get around to it.  Of course if I had say a &#8220;Green Jobs&#8221; non-profit as a client that would be a different story.</p>

<p>I am always bugging all of you to print more - this is your ticket if all your images are lonely locked up in your dark computer prison. Let them out.</p>
