  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s that time again, time for my not so regular rant on Photography&#8217;s state of the union. Well maybe not rant but search for understanding. My inspiration was a fellow photographer that I met wielding s brand spanking new state of the art 20 some megapixel DSLR. It wasn&#8217;t his first DSLR. Some really nice glass to. I actually had an M6 with me but it was inside a small bag.</p>

<p>We got to discussing photography and as you would expect and guess what. This guy doesn&#8217;t make prints - really. Well he does on the rare occasion but that is only once in a while and when he does they are 8 inches-ish wide. No crap, I can&#8217;t make this stuff up. Now I can see that if you are a working PJ and somebody else consumes your stuff and prints it why you would use a pro calibre high Mpix DSLR with big glass, even if you didn&#8217;t print personally. So let&#8217;s count those people out.</p>

<p>The vast majority of image consumption if you measure all images and all consumption is heading towards the web. Let&#8217;s even narrow that down to journalism and commercial advertising - we hear this every day. The trend is away from printed media. Let&#8217;s flip flop that and go with the consumer side of the equations. Not much printing that I can tell if my little circle of non-photographer friends and family are an indicator. They all love those little LCD picture frames and blazing through their images on the computer screen and then emailing a really small (700px on the long end) image to their friends or posting said image on the web in a few different ways.</p>

<p>So here is the question - why the hell is everyone so freaking obsessed with new better higher resolution cameras. Why  - I really really do not get it. I don&#8217;t get it. Please explain this to me. I am confounded by what seems to be completely illogical. Publish material about how to make better pictures (as in take them, not post process them into brash bold shocking trash) and nobody cares. Publish material on the latest greatest digital camera release - everyone that has no need has to know. I guess it is the same reason that everyone gives a crap about Tiger Woods and what he does with his personal life and I have no idea why.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yep, another ebook. So soon? Hey I have been working on these for a long time. This eBook covers Aperture organization. There is a good chance that if you are reading this that you may already have the free Aperture Organization PDF that I have made available for about the last year. If so I am not trying to convince you to purchase this one.</p>

<p>I have refined and expanded the coverage of some of the things that I covered in the free version but by no means is there any earth shattering new things. I have added a couple of things and change the way I have presented a few as well. I added some example material that I have been making notes of from people that have given me feedback or had additional questions but this is by no means  a whole new ball game.</p>

<p>If you have the old one and enjoyed it and feel like sending a couple of bucks my way. Great, it is always appreciated. If you don&#8217;t that is fine as well, hold on to your first version - it is a collectors item. Decoded that means please do not distribute the old version, it is no longer available. If you don&#8217;t have the old one or are dying to see what I added you will probably enjoy the new one. I don&#8217;t want to do so much patting myself on the back just because I put a lot of work into it but I can say that every piece of feedback that I have received on the old version was overwhelmingly positive. Almost 10,000 downloads of the old version, hundreds of emails from fans. In fact that is what motivated me to expand it and cover some other Aperture topics in the eBook format as well. Promises of first born children and such. The new one is better.</p>

<p>Okay what kind of stuff did I add - mostly just tidbits. Like how to deal with the issue that &#8220;edit with&#8230;&#8221; doesn&#8217;t make the new version the album pick. Things like that. Stuff that I thought was obvious in the first version that was apparently not so obvious. Maybe I added a few more work-flow type things.</p>

<p>Seriously if you understood everything I wrote on organization on this site you don&#8217;t need it. If you want some of it explained a little differently and all put together in one spot it might be what you are looking for. If you don&#8217;t have the old Aperture Organization Guide - You need this!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/GLMedia_2005_09_22_1723.jpg"><img title="GLMedia_2005_09_22_1723.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/.thumbs/.GLMedia_2005_09_22_1723.jpg" border="0" alt="GLMedia_2005_09_22_1723.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="99" height="150" align="left" /></a>Yep every once in a while I write a post about photographic lighting. I only do this when I stumble across something that I think my answer a lot of questions really quickly. I much prefer the &#8220;hands on approach&#8221; that I use in workshops that I do every once in a while. I prefer this because you can learn more in 5 minutes actually relating to the distances/spaces/angles in person than you can in a lifetime of looking at diagrams and descriptions and resulting images. I guess video is a little better but nothing like being there.</p>

<p>Okay - I had a reader write me about an image posted somewhere in an Aperture article. Actually it was a series of images that happened to be in a screen shot of an Aperture screen from way way back. The question was not about Aperture at all, it was quite literally &#8220;why does your softbox look different than mine?&#8221;. After a long email exchange - that answer came down to distance and fill light. I thought boiling that discussion down maybe useful to some of you that are have started to take your flash off the top of your camera. I randomly picked an image from the sequence that we discussed that happened to use a couple of the things that we talked about. It&#8217;s a JPG strait out of the camera - my usual M.O. when doing workshops.</p>

<p>When working with any light and especially a softbox or something similar the main goal is getting a bigger light source. If you make the light bigger but have it really far away it doesn&#8217;t accomplish much. You want to get it close - really close. Just about everyone knows this - well not everyone, in fact most people&#8217;s issue is that their definition of close is really not that close.  At some point when you reinvent your definition of close the results are still not what you &#8220;expect&#8221;. Why is this? Well if you happen to have a really really really gigantic light source and you are taking a picture of something really really small one light really really close may work extremely well. In most cases the biggest things you are going to use practically are a 3x4 or 4x6 box or smaller on normal sized things like people.</p>

<p>Getting a light source close does two things simultaneously, the first and usual goal is to make it &#8220;softer&#8221; or in other words make it bigger in relation to your subject. The second thing that it does that is usually unintended, at least to the lighting newbie, is that it makes everything else darker - your background - your reflected fill light - everything. In a way this makes it harder at the same time. Most people&#8217;s definition of &#8220;soft&#8221; when it comes to lighting visuals is a gradual shadow transition AND a somewhat close ratio between fill and main lights - sort of - you do not usually want it really &#8220;flat&#8221; - soft but not flat. Soft = good, flat = bad. At least my taste. The effect of moving your box closer and closer in a lot of cases can be counter productive to what you are trying to do. In summary you want it close but not too close, in most cases you want it closer than it is without causing everything else to get dark and the lighting ratio to increase too much.</p>

<p>What to do? Well you could add a fill light but that is for wimps and usually is not the best solution, not that adding a light is bad but most of the time it makes things more complicated and can lead to FLAT. It also chucks another catch light in the eyes (not good) - this is not the case if your fill is really really really really big but that takes a lot of work and space - usually not a reality for most location shots.</p>

<p>Wait we can use reflectors - yea that&#8217;s it. The problem with reflectors is as you get your softbox closer and closer the reflected light becomes darker to the point of pretty much useless if you want your box really close. most people solve this by placing the reflector as close as possible and then adjusting the distance of the softbox distance until they get the ratio they want. I am going to offer you a better way right now and the one most of my workshop participants are shocked at when they see the way I setup my lights.</p>

<p>Here is the big secret that works really well with softboxes and reflected fill - get your box really close and point it away from the subject towards the fill. Not all the way away of course but more away than flat on your subject. In most cases your softbox can be pointed so that the front is almost perpendicular to your subject plane. Doing this does a lot of things without changing the overall characteristic of the light. It changes the way specular highlights are rendered in some very interesting ways that you probably do not expect - in a lot of cases for the better. It increases the effectiveness of your reflected fill - be it from your environment or reflectors that you placed yourself. It can cut the light out of one side of the picture or reduce it. The real magic is that you can adjust how much of these things happen or don&#8217;t happen by simply twisting the way your box is pointed a little this way or a little that way.</p>

<p>So the image at the top - A reasonable sized room but not gigantic and to be blunt a little close for my taste. To camera right I have a 3x4 box really really close in front of the subject and a little to the right. Just out of frame. maybe 20 degrees to the right and in front. About 2 1/2 - 3 feet away. Really. It is pointed way more to the left than at the subject. On the left I have some very large white reflectors that run from in front to behind the subject. The walls would have done to but would have polluted the color a bit since they have an odd green-ness to the off-white. There is one other light - it is very far behind the subject on the left side. A 1x3 softbox that I have twisted, angled, and positioned in such a way that it is providing light on the background that is about 1 and 1/2 stops less than the main while providing a subtle rim light for separation on the left that is about 2/3 stops less than the main. That light has nothing to do with fill. In fact if you have two lights the last thing that I would use the second light for is fill unless you are going for flat.</p>

<p>Here is another with the same concept - box is a little to the left and in front of the subject<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/GLMedia_7.jpg"><img title="GLMedia_7.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/.thumbs/.GLMedia_7.jpg" border="0" alt="GLMedia_7.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="99" align="right" /></a>maybe 10-15 degrees off axis of where I am standing about 2 1/2-3 feet from the subject but it is pointed more up than right down at the subject. There is another light for the background and very very subtle rim light but it is angled so far behind the subject that it has nothing to do with the fill - you can see it where the light actually starts to go into black and then get&#8217;s lighter again.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. If you want more lighting stuff let me know, the only thing I have to go on if feedback from readers.</p>

You may remember it, I think it was called Photographers and Their tools or something like that. Anyway, after posting that I decided to ask a question over at APUG.com about not that specific negative but why Kodak Plus-X pan had a blue base.</p>

<p>I still do not have an answer to that question but I did get some interesting info - depending on your process the blue washes out, or not. As far as i can tell from all the input I got over on the APUG forum acid processes seem to remove the blue dyes and alkaline process seem to leave it there.</p>

<p>Getting to the point - a reader emailed me and ask what the actual printed image looked like. I could describe ti but I decided to scan it instead. I could do a better job at the scanning and post but this is a raw scan of the negative with no hanky panky. It doesn&#8217;t match the print exactly but it&#8217;s close enough for government work. In general the extreme highlights are rendered a little differently in the analog print. I could probably fix that here with a bit of gain dialed in to my scanner and some adjustments to compensate for the loss of shadow but who cares. At the end of the day I always thought that Kodak Plus-X and Pyro developers were a very good combination for caucasian skin tones. At least the way I like to render them.</p>

<p>In case you forgot - here is what the negative looked like on a light table.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Woooo Whooo, I received my very first question from an <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/aperture-ebooks/">Aperture File Management eBook</a> customer. Of course I answered his specific question ASAP but something that I touch on in the book crossed my mind as well that I thought people considering Aperture vs. Lightroom at this point may want to consider. Even a few of you Aperture old timers may find this a little interesting.</p>

<p>I have written about <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2008/10/01/aperture2-vs-lightroom2-file-management/">Lightroom&#8217;s and Aperture&#8217;s comparative file management capabilities</a> before but I wanted to add a different perspective or twist to it. There are a lot of people that choose to use Lightroom over Aperture because they &#8220;like&#8221; that Lightroom&#8217;s only file organizational tool happens to be whatever manually created folder structure on their hard drive. Of course Aperture can do the exact same thing if that is all you want but Aperture can do so much more. Heck you can use Aperture to sort, select, categorize, arrange, and group images any way that you want and then&#8230;. TAHHH DAHHH - use the file relocate master functions in combination with the subfolder options to have Aperture automatically create just about any pristine folder structure with your images as you could possibly imagine. AUTOMATICALLY and error free.</p>

<p>Personally after using Aperture I would far prefer to import my images into Aperture no matter how big a mess my folder structure was. Organize them using all of the Aperture tools and metadata and then have Aperture create the exact folder structure I wanted on disk. Even if every single image I had was in one giant pile. Aperture can suck them in and create a pristine by date folder hierarchy in one import and one relocate. Fantastic.</p>

<p>Hell - If I had to use Lightroom I would probably buy Aperture for the sole purpose of automating and standardizing my on disk folder structure or reorganizing the whole thing if I change my mind. I actually find it laughable that Lightroom users are so adamantly against the way Aperture &#8220;deals with folders and files&#8221;. That is only because they have no idea how quickly and easily Aperture can create recreate, reorganize, sort sift, wash, iron, and dry any folder structure that anybody could possibly imagine with about three mouse clicks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, I told you that I have been busy. Actually it is not an eBook, it&#8217;s an Aperture mini-eBook with a mini-price to match. This Aperture eBook happens to be about file management. Why file management you ask? Well because based on my non-clinical research that is what I happen to get the most questions on. As soon as people graduate from an entirely managed library they have a bunch of questions.</p>

<p>While I have tried to remain succinct, I have also attempted to be definitive in connecting all the dots with Aperture&#8217;s file management tools. This is the first edition but as far as humanly possible I have verified everything that is in it to be accurate. Now that took some time. The PDF eBook is 25 pages and covers not only managed and referenced files but previews, some common scenarios as examples, backup, how to take your library on the road with you, a couple of tips for dealing with the inevitable broken or corrupted library, even a brief discussion on RAID. <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/aperture-ebooks/">You can get it here</a>.</p>

<p>Here is some other news. You may have noticed that the PayPal donate button is gone. Here is the story - after two months I cannot even pay my hosting bill with the proceeds. Please know that I appreciate the many many folks that donated - I really do. Remember when I said I would give you a free eBook - well I lied. Well I didn&#8217;t lie I just changed my mind. I didn&#8217;t think that was fair since some people donated a whole lot and some people did not. Here is what I did instead - I accepted NONE of the donations, NOT ONE. Nobody that was kind enough to donate to my endeavors on the site has been billed not one dime yet and every single one that I received will have expired within 30 days from yesterday.</p>

<p>What I did instead was take the very smallest donation that I received, subtracted one penny, and made that the price of the eBook. If you want it and think it would help you great, if not that is fine to. If you made a donation that I did not collect and want to hold me to my word of a free eBook just give me an email - I do not want to be considered someone that goes back on my word.</p>

<p>If anyone has any issues buying or downloading the book please email me at rwboyer@mac.com and let me know ASAP. If you are one of the first ones to get your hands on the first edition and find something horribly askew or have any suggestions to improve the next version drop me a line - if it is something other than a spelling error I may even give you a free copy of the other eBooks that are in progress.</p>

<p>Enjoy</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/2002_006_05.jpg"><img title="2002_006_05.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/.thumbs/.2002_006_05.jpg" border="0" alt="2002_006_05.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" align="left" /></a>Had a few conversations with people still shooting film based on that crappy interview that I did. Quite a few of them had some questions about whether I use the Zone system for exposure and development as well as some questions about the Zone system. I thought I would share the crux of a couple of things that were revelations to them as well as myself about 20-25 years ago. Even if you don&#8217;t shoot film there are a couple of things that you might find helpful in your digital endeavors.</p>

<p>I am not going to rehash the zone system here - Ansel did a fine job of that in his three classic books a long time ago - sort of. Let&#8217;s just say it is a proposed system of gaining control over the medium so that the tones you envision are reproduced on your final print. The key word here is &#8220;envision&#8221;. One problem is that in countless examples explaining the zone system somebody else like Ansel explains the tones that they envision and some how those verbal descriptions seep into your subconscious as rules of what tone something is supposed to be. The second problem is that Zone VIII, IX, and X are treated in a lot of zone system tutorials as second class zone citizens, somehow to be avoided - sort of like &#8220;blown highlights&#8221; in digital.</p>

<p>In reality almost any photograph of any subject that lacks those last three zones will look flat and lifeless and way too dark. I am going to go off the deep end here and I am sure there will people that will disagree but Zone VII highlights are not the most important - Zone VIII bordering on Zone IX are the most important highlights in a photograph. Zone VIII is also the most important zone in the whole of the zone system. Not only is this the zone that makes things glow and sparkle especially in it&#8217;s upper regions but it is also the zone that is the target zone for all contrast manipulation during development when zone people talk about N, N+, and N- contrast expansions and contractions.</p>

<p>Now here is the real important tidbit that will shatter all zone system laws, religious texts, beliefs forever more. Are you ready? There is no turning back once you open this Pandora&#8217;s box - caucasian skin in sun, or any light for that matter IS NOT ZONE VI. Nope that&#8217;s right, I really do not know how many times that the brilliant zone system powers that be, including AA, has used the absolutely terrible example of caucasian skin in sunlight as the archetypical example of zone a VI tone but this is not just a matter of taste - it is dead wrong. If you expose develop and print caucasian skin at zone VI your print will look like absolute shit.</p>

<p>Maybe this is why 99% of zone system photographers are landscape guys/gals. Given my overly creative imagination I can envision a person learning to do the zone system the right way a long time ago making wonderfully detailed landscapes and then taking a picture of an actual person, dutifully and carefully exposing developing and printing for zone VI skin and being so depressed with how horrible the image is that he/she swears off taking pictures of people forever more. Probably not but I am just making a point.</p>

<p>Caucasian looks the best and so do your prints when skin tones are mostly Zone VII going into and having a healthy dose of Zone VIII. If there are specular highlights they may go into zone IX or even - oh my god - bordering on zone X, especially if they are not diffuse but actually reflections on shinier skin, just like any other reflection. When I was talking about VII and VIII I was not talking about reflections.</p>

<p>Now I am sure that you will find situations and actual people where this does not hold true for the best image - just like anything else, there are exceptions to this rule as there are all rules. I just have no idea why all of the zone system related information out there uses the horrible example of caucasian skin being representative as a typical zone VI. Just a typical example at the top of the page - The window is the light source in this image the brightest areas are a mix of zone IX and X. The wall close to the window is a mix of Zone IX fading into zone VIII. The skin for the most part is Zone VII and VIII with a tiny bit of IX on the edge. Heck even the shadow on the breast closest to the window is Zone V and VI.</p>

<p>Hope this is at all useful.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/2000_001_22.jpg"><img title="2000_001_22.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/.thumbs/.2000_001_22.jpg" border="0" alt="2000_001_22.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="left" /></a>I have had a couple of emails from loyal readers wondering if I am okay. Yes I am okay - my little rant aside (thank you for all the support, I just wanted to vent a little). I have been a little busy lately so have not had much time to put into posting on the site. Here is why. Well first off I am putting a lot of work into some portrait projects that I am working on and I have decided to shoot it all on film - not just any film but 8x10 film - extremely time consuming and I am just getting started. I haven&#8217;t shot 8x10 in years, just laziness.</p>

<p>The other reason I have had not a whole lot of time is I have been hard at work for the last month or so authoring some new Aperture e-book guides. I am trying to make them packed with practical information while keeping them as succinct as possible - not an easy thing to do. I hope to have them available within the next month or so, keep your eyes peeled - they are coming. I thought about one giant eBook but instead I settled on 5 smaller shorter and more focused eBooks on subjects that have generated the most questions that I get on the site as well as things I see over on the Apple support forum. The bad news is they will not be free - they will be a couple of bucks each for three reasons. The first being that I promised myself and others that this site would pay for itself next year. The second is that the time I am putting in to these is actually cutting into time I should be doing other things professionally (being self employed I really need to think about that). The third reason is that I provide a lot of time off-line answering questions and giving people support on the subject matter and I want to continue to do so. Anyone that donated to the site is welcome to the eBooks when they are available (I know who you are just email me).</p>

<p>Last but not least I just did an interview with Inside Analog Photo - The interviewer was great, really nice guy - me I am not so great but if you are interested <a href="http://www.insideanalogphoto.com/inside-analog-photo-radio-robert-boyer/281">you can hear it at this site</a>. Feel free to leave comments but try to be nice.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yep, There are some rules that I have figured out. You may not like them but they are so far true as far as I can see. Here they are as plain as day.</p>

<ol>
    <li>You cannot do better than what you are seeing, If it looks fantastic you will get only a tiny bit of that.</li>
    <li>Light cannot be better than what nature has produced, you can try but you will not get far.</li>
    <li>You are only a jerk with a camera and somehow you think you are the only one that can possibly see what you see. You are wrong, everybody sees exactly what you see - you may pay a little more attention to somethings than others and vis-a-vis buy you are no different.</li>
    <li>Your prints on paper will never ever ever be as bright as you saw them. Never.</li>
    <li>Your photos will suck compared to the one in the mind&#8217;s eye.</li>
    <li>Your mind&#8217;s eye sucks compared Â to reality.</li>
    <li>No lens, camera, technique, or secret recipe will ever come close to recording exactly what you felt and what you wanted to show anyone else.</li>
    <li>Even if you know all of the above you will still try by all means possible to show just one other person exactly what you saw and felt.</li>
    <li>You have to be insane.</li>
    <li>Even if you hate the world you have to love.</li>
</ol>


<p>Just some food for thought,</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I received an extremely hateful email today. I am usually conditioned to that, given that I actually put some kind of thought and position out there for the whole world to see, judge, and respond. I have responded to those both personally and privately that are seeking help. I have also mentioned a few where I thought it might be useful for other&#8217;s questions.</p>

<p>This particular one I am going to address head on, I do not give a shit about anything else. In fact this one calls into question why I try to produce anything useful on the internet at all.</p>

<p>1) I love photography.</p>

<p>2) I love the accuracy of the medium.</p>

<p>3) I know and believe that every single image I have ever made tells the truth.</p>

<p>4) I believe that the camera can tell lies.</p>

<p>5) I believe people want to know truth.</p>

<p>6) I believe that seekers of better ways to tell lies are evil and those that seekers of better ways to tell truth are good.</p>

<p>I may be lame here but fuck this guy. FUCK HIM.</p>
