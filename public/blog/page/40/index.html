  <div class="entry-content"><p>As most of you do - I also like to keep up to date on things going on with Photography. All sides and aspects of it. Even if I do not participate in one genre or another. Even if my preferences are completely opposed to a particular style, or material, or technique, I have a healthy respect for things that are not my cup of tea and have a genuine interest in keeping up with what is going on - photographically. The only way to do that is that I have to keep an open mind and give things a chance even if my first reaction is one of dismissal. Every once in a while my initial reaction is absolutely wrong, most of the time it is right. That is the price you pay in time and psychological aggravation to allow yourself to be open to new things and to continue learning in the great journey of life.</p>

<p>Okay - so why the not so open minded title. Well I take in so much crap in my desire for knowledge and understanding that every once in a while I really have to vent a little tiny bit of hatefulness. Take it as my little edutainment segment. So here is my hate list of the week.</p>

<p>I hate pretentiousness in art - be it naive pretentiousness, be it subconscious pretentiousness, be it not well thought out random pretentiousness. I really don&#8217;t care if it is accidental and unintended or on purpose. I hate it with a passion. Unfortunately I love art - especially really really great photographic art. To get to that you really have to put up with a lot of nonsense. I kind of poked a little fun at this kind of thing a while back in my fine art photography lesson. I hope I didn&#8217;t give the impression that I do not have deep respect for photographic artists - I do. To put a project together and really do something worthwhile takes a lot of work. Maybe a lifetime of work. It usually is apparent, even if you don&#8217;t like the work - the work part is pretty apparent and stands on it&#8217;s own merits.</p>

<p>On behalf those out there that have put in the work and those that are putting in the work I have to be insulted when I run across &#8220;artists&#8221; selling their prints on-line where there is no evidence whatsoever of &#8220;the work&#8221;. Example, I listen to a lot of interviews with photographers. While I am listening I like to flip through the &#8220;work&#8221; they are talking about. Art photographers call pictures &#8220;work&#8221;, that&#8217;s okay it can be a lot of work - except when it&#8217;s not. In a particular interview I was listening to this week, I fired up the ole web browser and started to look through the artist&#8217;s &#8220;body of work&#8221; for not one but a couple separate Â &#8221;bodies of work&#8221; as the interview was going on in the background.</p>

<p>These &#8220;bodies of work&#8221; were called something like &#8220;so and so and so I&#8221; and &#8220;so and so and so II&#8221;. Here is what we got - a dozen or so really really blurry square black and white dark pictures all titled &#8220;untitled&#8221; of random shit laying around the living room, dining room, bedroom, and kitchen of the same house - most likely on the same day - even more likely on the same roll of film. The &#8220;so and so and so II&#8221; Â &#8221;body of work&#8221; was probably the same day on a different roll of film. Wait - here is the punch line - they also all had the title of untitled - and both &#8220;bodies of work&#8221; not only where the pictures titled untitled - here it comes - every single one of them, every single one had a title of &#8220;untitled (xxxxxxxxx)&#8221; where the xxxxxxxx part was like knife, remote, shelf paper. The icing on the cake was the audio interview explaining that the &#8220;work&#8221; represented a very very dark place in the artists life, lots of banter and allusion to drag the dark place on and on so the interviewer could drag the emotion out - this work represents the dark place that was going on during the long agonizing &#8220;death of a loved father&#8221;. This is also in the &#8220;artists statement&#8221;. Not a big secret.</p>

<p>Honestly I don&#8217;t know if any of the words are even true but it doesn&#8217;t really matter. If you need to be explicit in that kind of thing to generate some sort of emotional whatever that is pretentious - really. I could not careless if this artist sells prints or not. I do take it as an affront to all of the really really hard work put in by countless photographic artists throughout history - not to sell prints - but to make art. The outrageous arrogance that this &#8220;artist&#8221; has in believing that a roll of film or two through his/her new toy Holga qualifies as &#8220;fine art&#8221; because it looked cool is absolutely stunning. Hey look how cool the remote control looks when it is blurry - it&#8217;s art - now it&#8217;s for sale.</p>

<p>More hate next week.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. Feel free to agree/disagree or whatever - Please do not take this as I think there is no really good photographic art made with less than outstanding sharpness - take a look at Keith Carter or someone like that. My issue is that it is a shame for people like KC et al that any yo-yo that picks up a camera that makes blurry pictures of untitled (shelf paper) is in the same league and is at all representative of the &#8220;work&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/full.jpg"><img title="full.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/.thumbs/.full.jpg" border="0" alt="full.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="94" align="left" /></a>I was actually working with Aperture on my beautiful new Macbook Pro unibody yesterday and rediscovered one of the joys of using the software. I never really forgot about it, I just had a renewed appreciation for it&#8217;s wonderfulness. I thought I would share and reintroduce some of the subtle but really useful touches that Aperture provides that allow you to work more productively while we are all waiting for that Aperture 3/Aperture X goodness.</p>

<p>One of the things that I use all the time even on my giant displays is the ever useful &#8220;I&#8221; key. While nice on a giant monitor, it is a godsend on a laptop. Just hit the I key and the inspector panes go away. Hit &#8220;I&#8221; again and they are back. Really wonderful but wait there is more. Shift &#8220;I&#8221; moves the inspector panes from the left side of the screen to the right side and back. Not terribly useful but if you like it better on once side or the other you have a choice. Never underestimate the power of &#8220;liking it better&#8221;, it can be the difference between one of the little things throughout the day that doesn&#8217;t have to go against your grain. Sort of a feng-shui kind of thing.</p>

<p>A couple of other really nice touches that you may have forgotten about but can come in really handy are the ever not so popular Shift-W and Option-W. Shift-W, officially known as rotate<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/horz.jpg"><img title="horz.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/.thumbs/.horz.jpg" border="0" alt="horz.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="92" align="right" /></a> browser position takes the browser strip and swaps it from running horizontally to running vertically. Option-W, swap browser position, flips the browser strip from left to right or top to bottom. These two features in combination with the &#8220;I&#8221; and Shift-I work wonders on a laptop and are actually very useful on just about any monitor when maximizing screen real estate <a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/vert.jpg"><img title="vert.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/.thumbs/.vert.jpg" border="0" alt="vert.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="92" align="left" /></a>for the job at hand - along with a healthy dose of personal preference.</p>

<p>Of course never forget the unsung heros of screen real estate maximization, &#8220;D&#8221; and Shift-D. The D key hides and shows the Â &#8221;control bar&#8221;. That way it isn&#8217;t taking up any screen space when not in use, but more importantly it is not there bugging the living crap out of me. Even if you love the control bar, that doesn&#8217;t mean it has to be there when you are not using it. Shift-D toggles the control bar between rating functions and keyword controls. Depending on what I am doing some times I use keyword controls and<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/swap.jpg"><img title="swap.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/.thumbs/.swap.jpg" border="0" alt="swap.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="92" align="right" /></a> sometimes I use pre-assigned function key groups to keyword my images. When I am not key-wording it is not there taking up space and cluttering things up. I almost never use the rating function control bar, I use shortcut keys.</p>

<p>I have used the shortcut keys to describe some of Aperture&#8217;s subtle but very nice UI customization features but they are also available under the View-&gt;Browser menu and the Window menu. I really like that this stuff is available via shortcut keys, it makes it really fast. Here is a tip that I have mentioned more than a few times to get to know the keyboard shortcuts - go to the menu and look at the shortcut. Instead of using the menu item actually use the key. This may cost you a little bit of time the first three or four times but the amount of wasted motion that it saves for the next 85,394 times will pay you back in a big way.</p>

<p>One other thing to remember about Aperture and the UI customization features, all the customization features for that matter. They are not checkboxes in the preferences dialog and they have shortcut keys for a good reason. This is not a matter of set it and forget it. You can really benefit both productivity wise and enjoyment wise by very very quickly tailoring Aperture to what you are doing right here and now - dynamically. When other more casual Aperture users see me use Aperture on my laptop using the &#8220;I&#8221;, &#8220;W&#8221;, Shift-W, etc they really Â don&#8217;t see me using the keys they just see Aperture transform itself to suit my desires in the blink of an eye. Without fail they ask me &#8220;how&#8217;d ya do that, I didn&#8217;t know you could do that, cool&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In case you have not seen this before, I wanted to share some links to a pair of professional wedding photographers that switched from Lightroom 2 to Aperture 2. Now here is the punch line - THEY ARE NIKON SHOOTERS. Yep, that is right Nikon wedding photographers that switched from Lightroom 2 to Aperture 2.</p>

<p>I know I complain about a couple of nagging things, including NEF conversion and WB handling in Aperture but trust me, if Aperture was not the best tool for workflow and organization and&#8230; I would have switched a long time ago. I own both, I know both inside and out. I know how to convert just about everything I care about. One of the things that is becoming more and more clear to me is that photographers that want a really better way of interacting with their libraries as a whole and are very demanding of the environment in which they spend their time prefer Aperture. Especially photographers that have a general bent towards &#8220;strait&#8221; photography. Photographers that spend lots of time manipulating their images and are satisfied with the file system facilities to organize their images and the work associated with those images seem to prefer Lightroom.</p>

<p>To me Lightroom seems like a smarted up version of Bridge or Bridge a dumbed down version of Lightroom. They have become even closer with CS4.</p>

<p>On to the videos - check them out if you have time.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jasonaten.net/whyiloveaperture.mov">Video Two</a></p>

<p>The other thing that is pretty amazing is that this guy makes his money shooting weddings - not selling Aperture add-ons or education. Aperture users that have seen the light are pretty enthusiastic folks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wanted to share with those of you that frequent the site (not via search or links to specific posts) some random thoughts and updates about the site. One thing that you may have noticed is the glaringly ugly Paypal button on the left hand side of the posts. Yep it&#8217;s ugly and I hate to ugly up the site but I really need to make the whole thing cost neutral in 2010. If you find anything of value about Aperture, etc. I would really appreciate anything that you can afford - $1, $5, $10, $3.42 - whatever.</p>

<p>I have decided to do this because the site is not &#8220;you gotta have this thing&#8221; focused and I do not embed a lot of &#8220;you gotta buy this&#8221; links in the posts. I am affiliated with a grand total of two retailers that pay chump change for referrals - Amazon and B+H - only because I use them frequently myself. Some of you have decided to purchase a few items here and there via Amazon and one person from B+H, I really do thank those of you thad did but&#8230; That brought in $72 for 2009 - this doesn&#8217;t cover my hosting - just another thing for the significant other to complain about. The big reason is not the amount of traffic I get it is the amount of things I write about - like Aperture - that most of the visitors already own in combination with the way other sites cheat on affiliate programs like Amazon, etc. Namely they use cookie stuffing - you visit the site, you end up with the sites code for every affiliate program known to man kind without even clicking on anything - it&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t have the capability to do this - I am quite astute - I just find it morally unsettling. Hopefully the donate thing will help me make this cost neutral in 2010.</p>

<p>On another note - I made my commitment to Aperture public yesterday. I intend to continue to update and share my thoughts on Aperture 2 and hopefully Aperture 3 even if I am the last one standing. Why? Because I use it and I like it and it saves me time. Not because it is the most popular or profitable thing to write about on the internet. Trust me I get about 2000-3000 hits a day - not a lot but not too shabby either for a personal blog that talks about really specialized things and that happens with no tricky keyword business of trying to drive traffic to the site that has nothing to do with what people are looking for.</p>

<p>Funny example - guess what the number one post was for the last two days? Remember that silly &#8220;Most Glamourous Ever&#8221; post? Yep in the last two days that has generated the most views by a wide margin with everything else spread out evenly. The two search terms that got people to the post were &#8220;Raquel Welsh&#8221; and &#8220;Catherine Zeta-Jones&#8221; - I am sure that I am like 50 pages down the list but haven&#8217;t checked. Funny.</p>

<p>Have a great weekend everybody.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2009_006_02.jpg"><img title="2009_006_02.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2009_006_02.jpg" border="0" alt="2009_006_02.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" align="left" /></a>Well I finally took the plunge, I have searched out inexpensive film and decided to try Efke 100. Not just try it but calibrate it and get to know it. As you may have gathered I am a Kodak film shooter for the most part. The reason I am searching for cheaper film is that I am working on a few projects that are requiring quite a bit of 8x10 film. If you haven&#8217;t checked lately Kodak 8x10 is hideously expensive, not a big deal if I shoot a couple of sheets a month but I am planning on shooting a lot. I happened to search for low priced 8x10 film and can get Efke 100 at about half the cost of Kodak. Still not cheap but half of ridiculous is less than full ridiculous.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t go full bore hog wild and acquire a couple hundred dollars worth of the stuff without getting to know it a little bit I took a short cut - a low cost short cut. I bought 5 rolls of 120 to test and calibrate it to my developer and my process. Here are a couple of things I have found so far and I am only finished the first roll. The first thing is that it seems to be a lot less red/yellow/orange sensitive than my regular 100 speed film (Kodak TMX). I found this out not by making a direct comparison but by making a couple of mistakes while shooting the first roll. Namely I instinctively shot a landscape with a green filter - usually appropriate to darken up the sky and brighten the foreground but in this case I saw that it was clearly the wrong choice after making a few exposures. The foliage was not green it was yellow and orange - it&#8217;s fall. So I switched to an orange filter. Of course I shot the scene without any filtration as well. Based on my experience with the way these filters react and the way that I know TMX reacts, I can tell that Efke 100 is less red sensitive.</p>

<p>Of course the grain is way bigger than TMX but who cares in 8x10 - not a problem. The other thing<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2009_006_02_40x.jpg"><img title="2009_006_02_40x.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2009_006_02_40x.jpg" border="0" alt="2009_006_02_40x.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" align="right" /></a> that I learned is that the film looks way different when processing it than any other film I have ever used. It looked fine when I first hung it up to dry. After a few minutes when I walked back into the darkroom and saw it I thought that it was horribly flawed. It really looked like the film base was made from frosted glass. My instant reaction was that somehow I had reticulated the emulsion while processing it. I thought this because I knew that my wash was 1 degree F cooler than the rest of my process. Normally this would not be an issue to even consider but other peoples general opinion was that Efke 100 had a very fragile emulsion.</p>

<p>I took this with a grain of salt since most peoples development process is all over the map compared to what I consider careful handling. So I immediately said to my self that this level of fragility was idiotic and definitely wouldn&#8217;t do if a 1 degree difference in the wash was enough to completely destroy the film. Here is the punch line - after the film dried completely overnight it was perfect with a perfectly clear clean base. So it maybe fragile but not that insane. The frosty fogginess while drying looks to be normal. Thank god - the 8x10 cheap Efke 100 is still a go.</p>

<p>Compared to TMX and PXP Efke 100 seems to be a bit slower maybe like 2/3 of a stop slower in the shadows a couple more rolls and I will know exactly what speed it is in the shadows. Of course this maybe developer dependent but I am speaking from a common developer for all three. I really do like the gradation and overall curve of the films response. I am going to shoot it against TMX so that I can accurately compare the two characteristic curves just for academic reasons but Efke has a very pretty upper midrange and rich midtone gradation in general.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2009_006_02_8x.jpg"><img title="2009_006_02_8x.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2009_006_02_8x.jpg" border="0" alt="2009_006_02_8x.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" align="left" /></a>The couple of things that I do not like about it can be managed. The first thing is that the film base is really thin, cheap and curly. The included scans are not even close to critically sharp because there was no way to get the film flat in my glassless holders for scanning - I am going to have to use a hydraulic press for like a week to get this stuff flat. The other thing that really doesn&#8217;t matter but could is the lack of quality control is pretty evident even from the burned out blown out, and inconsistent edge numbers on the Efke. Obviously this is not in an of itself an issue but if it is a harbinger for other quality control problems that may be a concern. For now it is a go forward with the Efke 8x10 - if I run into specific quality or consistency issues I will post a note on what exactly they are later on.</p>

<p>I processed this sample in Pyrocat HD 1+1+100. My standard developer for a number of reasons - if anyone cares I will be glad to share why I use it. As usual the middle image is the obligatory &#8220;100%&#8221; at 40x magnification, can&#8217;t really tell much about a film from looking at that besides it is grainier than TMX and it is sharp. I may go with a new policy on showing films under magnification, the last image is the image at 8x - that would be a tiny piece of a 20&#8221; x 20&#8221; print - most likely I will not even print this big, it just happens to be the biggest loupe I own and how I inspect film visually. Let me know what you think about the 8x vs the 40x - personally I think the 8x tells you a lot more about the film. The development was just about N (normal) based on my measurements and metering - that was a surprise given it was the first roll. I really like the way it separates subtle tones at N processing. The only manipulation was to make the film base black the rest of it is a raw scan. Even this crappy unfiltered test shot would look fantastic with about 2 minutes of dodging and burning. I declare Efke 100 pretty nice for half the cost of TMX - I think I will really like it in 8x10.</p>

<p>Wish me luck with the Cheap 8x10. Obviously I am going to shoot and calibrate the rest of the 120 before purchasing the 8x10.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As many of you may have heard over the last week or so a book appeared on Amazon that had Aperture X in the title. It was available for pre-order with availability in the Spring of 2010. This has led to a lot of chatter about an imminent release of the next major version of Aperture. The word on the street is the release will be rebranded as Aperture X to align it with OS X or something like that.</p>

<p>While I have no specific knowledge of Apple&#8217;s release plans or naming strategy I have heard from a lot of sources that I consider reliable that we will be getting a major Aperture update very very soon. This wouldn&#8217;t surprise me at all and I hope soon means this year. Just so we can all see what it does, make our decisions on what software we use. and get on with our work. I thought that I would share a couple of my own thoughts on Aperture versus Lightroom and my own plans, considering I answer that question either in person or via email about 100 times a day.</p>

<p>To make a long story short - I plan to stick with Aperture for the foreseeable future for my own use. The only way that I would switch to Lightroom is if there were such significant features and improvements released by Adobe that it would actually make my life better, save me a lot of time, and cause me to enjoy spending time in Lightroom. You heard that right - I know Lightroom very well, I think it is a great piece of software, but I do not enjoy it at all. I actually enjoy organizing in Aperture. For what I do and what I care about Aperture still leaves Lightroom in the dust. When working with my photos in Lightroom I feel boxed in or something. I really do not like the separate library, develop, etc modes in Lightroom. I do not think that a lot of the organizational tools are all that flexible or thought out, stacks are virtually useless, etc.</p>

<p>This may surprise you considering how much I complain about default NEF processing in Aperture among other things but those things are minor compared to how slow working in Lightroom is for me. I am glad that Adobe released the Lightroom 3 beta - there is nothing that I want or better said Â - nothing revolutionary that causes me to want to switch. My commitment to Aperture (for my personal photography and my personal library) is solid and if any of you were wondering - as soon as Aperture 3 or Aperture X hits the streets I will have it and will continue trying to explain the best way to use it to all of the loyal readers out there.</p>

<p>Here is a promise - when it comes out I will dedicate 100% of my focus to update and expand my Aperture guides to be better, stronger, and include all of the Aperture X/Aperture 3 goodness as soon as it is humanly possible to produce with a degree of quality and accuracy that I am comfortable with.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. Obviously the only other reason I would switch is if Apple themselves made it very clear there was no Aperture future - as in the product is cancelled.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple of times I have lamented the passing of Polaroid Corp. Sure I really miss the materials that I shot, especially Polaroid Type 55 P/N in large format. I even miss the color materials that I of course tried but never really used in any quantities or as an artistic medium. The one thing that never came through in those passing mentions of how sad I was that some of the materials itself are gone was how sad I was that the Polaroid company itself was gone.</p>

<p>Why this makes me sad is a really complicated and difficult issue to describe. Of all the companies related to photography that there are and that were, Polaroid had a very special relationship to photographers and the art of photography that grew up with film. I have had a couple of off-line conversations with some other people that understand this like I do but <a href="http://www.insideanalogphoto.com/inside-analog-photo-radio-20x24-polaroid/272">this interview</a>, especially the second half of it, does a fantastic job of putting the whole thing into words that I could never do.</p>

<p>If you are into photography, like really into it, you need to listen to the <a href="http://www.insideanalogphoto.com/inside-analog-photo-radio-20x24-polaroid/272">interview with John Reuter over on the &#8220;Inside Analog Photo Radio&#8221; site</a>. Even if you came up and are digital, understanding a little bit of history is a good thing.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. Holy crap - am I turning into some sort of activist or something?</p>

<p>Pss. Sorry for the confusion - I just updated the links to contain the real meat of the interview - the Audi0. The video portion is nice but nothing compared to the audio interview.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/1999_009_09.jpg"><img title="1999_009_09.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.1999_009_09.jpg" border="0" alt="1999_009_09.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="102" height="150" align="left" /></a>A while ago I mentioned the concept of &#8220;important&#8221; images. My thoughts are that the pictures you make of people that are close to you are the most important ones that you will ever make. Not the abstract that win you third prize in the local art show. Not the ones that you make for advertisements that may pay the bills, etc. etc. Paying the bills is important but the images themselves are really not that important.</p>

<p>Here is a small example of what I am talking about. Take these couple of images. They are just a few of the images that I casually shot of daughter number 2. Amazing changes. The funny thing is that all of these are inside a space of under 2 years. While it is true that you will never take the same image twice or capture that same moment in time even if you shoot a tree in your garden or the beach or the lake. This is so much more true of people.</p>

<p>One of the things that I find amazing and sad. Is how much a lot of pro photographers do<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/1999_024_04.jpg"><img title="1999_024_04.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.1999_024_04.jpg" border="0" alt="1999_024_04.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="right" /></a>not shoot the people that are close to them because it is too much like work. Even more astonishing to me is that a lot of photography oriented web <a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2000_005_16.jpg"><img title="2000_005_16.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2000_005_16.jpg" border="0" alt="2000_005_16.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="left" /></a>sites that you will visit put so little emphasis on how important this is. In fact a lot of sites that I run across treat images of people close to them as some how subservient to other photographic endeavors. I have seen pro after pro drone on incessantly about how to do landscape well and what equipment to use to light models and what cameras are the best for getting maximum quality for wildlife, etc, etc. when mentioning what they use or how they take images of people close to them they treat it like an afterthought. &#8220;Oh just any old digicam, it doesn&#8217;t really<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2000_050_29.jpg"><img title="2000_050_29.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2000_050_29.jpg" border="0" alt="2000_050_29.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="right" /></a>matter&#8221;. I find this very disturbing.</p>

<p>I may be taking it a bit far here but I actually find it insulting to most people and why most people value photography. More dangerously than just being insulting, I really don&#8217;t like the subtext that somehow shooting the people close to you is not as important as shooting a landscape or a model or whatever the more &#8220;professional&#8221; endeavor is.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2001-019-05_1.jpg"><img title="2001-019-05_1.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2001-019-05_1.jpg" border="0" alt="2001-019-05_1.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" align="left" /></a>Just had to say this. Sorry for the rant.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. Since about 2 years old daughter number 2 has insisted on doing her own thing with the hair. So the style is all hers. She&#8217;s pretty good at it now. Could you tell her favorite activity is drama (as in plays/acting)</p>

I chucked up a couple of images that I shot while walking around. The shots were of stairs. Yep you heard that right - stairs. You see I for reasons unknown to me have some really strange compulsion to shoot stairs of all shapes and sizes. I have never made a &#8220;real&#8221; project out of it and am usually ill equipped to shoot them. Even without making it a concerted effort I have about 70 prints that I have made over the years of these images.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t do anything with them. I don&#8217;t hang them up on walls or show them to people. The APUG discussion was a rare exception where I sought out a bunch of people thoughts on which particular similar image they thought was print worthy. Hey I am trying to go green here I don&#8217;t think I want to actually make 3 different prints of the same staircase with different compositions. I didn&#8217;t get an answer - definitively - as to which one was printworthy. There were supporters and detractors of each image. Who would have thought? I guess that didn&#8217;t surprise me, what did surprise me is how many folks have similar secret<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2009_005_22.jpg"><img title="2009_005_22.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2009_005_22.jpg" border="0" alt="2009_005_22.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="100" align="right" /></a> subjects - things that for no particular reason they are compelled to shoot. I am not talking about general things like people or landscapes. I am talking about very specific things like stairs, doors, windows, electric meters, dead trees, you name it. Not just once or for a week but over years and years.</p>

<p>Does every photo enthusiast have that other think that they are <a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2009_005_23.jpg"><img title="2009_005_23.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2009_005_23.jpg" border="0" alt="2009_005_23.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="left" /></a>drawn to shoot? Do you have something like that? Would love to hear what it is. I am sure it would make those of us that have that secret obsession feel a little less strange. The attached images are the latest grabs from a walk I took to warm up the Leica M6 for it&#8217;s come back as my carry around camera. They were shot on Kodak TRI-X and processed in Pyrocat HD.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Leo Patrone looks like he gets a bunch of work. I can see why, he has a great style for weddings. You really should check his work out. If you shoot family pictures just for yourself or professionally you owe it to yourself to get some ideas from this guy. Timeless and classic - meaning not tricky, it&#8217;s all about the people in the pictures. The pictures just get out of the way.</p>

<p><a href="http://leopatronephotography.blogspot.com/">Leo Patrone does classic work</a>. He shoots film. I will bet money that 10 years from now the people that hire this guy will be really happy and continue to cherish this work where the people that hire the latest greatest digital guy that is running all the fad of the moment photoshop actions will more likely cringe when the get a peek of those out of the corner of their eye. I am telling you - all special tricks and wow that looks cool stuff that is so prevalent in a lot of commercial and wedding photography today is tomorrows polyester leisure suit.</p>

<p>This guy uses very simple but nice equipment - A Contax 645 with normal 80mm f2 and Nikon F5&#8217;s with a 50 and an 85. He shoots all his stuff on film AND he processes his own C41. You could probably afford the same state of the art film processor from a few years ago if you had the space for it as well - you may be able to find one for free locally. No shit.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. This guy is not an cranky old guy like me - he is like 26.</p>
