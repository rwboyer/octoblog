  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/2009_008_11_lvl_grey.jpg"><img title="2009_008_11_lvl_grey.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/.thumbs/.2009_008_11_lvl_grey.jpg" border="0" alt="2009_008_11_lvl_grey.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" align="left" /></a>Had a couple of interesting phone conversations that started with emails from some readers that are considering shooting some film. A couple of experiences that they had in the past turned them off to it so they had a couple of questions. While they were all fine and dandy with the cost argument when wanting to up their quality game the big concern was their intent to scan the film and their experience was that scanned film looked like s**t and totally undermined what quality they may have gotten by moving up in capture size/reduced magnification.</p>

<p>The big big big deal for them was film grain and how crappy it looked even on slow speed film. There is a ton of information out there on scanning film but I thought I would share a couple of things that surprised the folks that I talked to because they had never read/heard/thought about them before. Namely some more info on noise and grain and why it is such a big issue with digital folk.Â Here are a couple of things to think about that are way different when producing digital output vs. analog output.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s for a second talk about noise and grain as if they are exactly the same thing. For the most part grain noise is really not that high of contrast compared to overall picture contrast in most circumstances. Second grain size is relatively small even with higher speed films relative to how many pixels that you have for the scanned image. In this case the film dynamic range matches up to your scanner pretty close and grain noise will not be a huge issue, it will work/look similar to analog print output at any given size, not really but close enough not to fuss with.</p>

<p>The issue comes based on two factors, contrast manipulation of the scanned image and what digital interpolation or resizing algorithms do versus analog enlargement. Analog enlargement actually makes every single thing optically bigger the more you enlarge the image, conversely the less you enlarge the physically smaller it makes everything - including the grain noise. Now for the punch line - you are going to have to think about this for a minute to wrap your head around it - your first reaction is going to be &#8220;bullshit&#8221;. When you scan/digitize film you are starting out with the biggest image/enlargement you are ever going to get and when you resize downward (less magnification) the grain does not get smaller, well it may if it is HUGE but if it is a pixel or so big it cannot get smaller it stays the same but it&#8217;s size in relationship to the image as a whole may become gigantic as you make your image smaller and smaller, like for screen or web display. In effect this is exactly the reverse effect of analog optical printing/display.</p>

<p>If your original scanned image matches the output resolution for a print/print size that you want to make within reason there is no reason to worry about this even if it looks like shit on your screen resized to 75-100dpi if your output medium is more like 300+ dpi. Why? Well, because your grain is still only a pixel or few wide in the file that is very very very many pixels - optically it will be small. Resize that image to 500 pixels wide and guess what now the whole image is only a few pixels and the grain is still a pixel of a few wide. Still this is not usually a big issue if your negative/positive that was scanned matched the dynamic range of your scanner and you did not jack the contrast up. The two things that really aggravate this effect are really flat/low contrast negatives and really really giant hi-res scans of big film that has had the contrast jacked up. Why - you are going to make the noise more contrasty as well - the higher the contrast the more weight the digital interpolation when making the file SMALLER will give to the grain noise and through the low contrast pixels away. This is how resizing works. The resize has no freaking idea what is detail and what is grain and what is noise.</p>

<p>As I said for small film of normal contrast range with a average lab resolution film scan this is not a giant issue - the web size/display size stuff still emphasizes the grain noise more than it should compared to an optical/analog print but nothing to be really upset about and in prints of the same linear dimensions it should not be an issue at 300dpi or above. The real issue come in when you are scanning medium and large format films at very high resolution and need to resize to a much smaller file and when you are dealing with low contrast negatives that need to have the contrast boosted in a big way.</p>

<p>So what to do beyond having someone else deal with the scanning and file sizing, etc?</p>

<p>1 -One only worry about this when you are downsizing a file in a significant way if you have the right or close to right number of pixels to make the print you want at the real resolution of the printer you will never see it in the prints. When I say &#8220;you&#8221; I also mean the printer itself - I have seen bad things (grain in LF scans) this happen when sending a file that is way way too big for the print size to an ink jet printer - ie. 4000dpi scan of 8x10 negative to make an 8x10 print. Guess what - grain.</p>

<p>2 - My policy is to capture as much information as I can when I scan - highest resolution, etc. If I need to resize downward huge scan files I do a noise reduction on them using Nik Dfine either before the resize. The visual effect of a screen sized image is the same. I also do the same thing if I am printing significantly smaller than the optimum size for the format/scan. I do not remove the noise from the file at scan time, I do it based on output intent so that the visual effect is the same I get from analog optical prints.</p>

<p>3- If I need to jack the contrast up for a given negative and I know I am going to do a down-sample I do a noise reduction on the un-manipulated layer. This usually works the best but occasionally I find that noise reduction after the contrast adjustment works better. I have not narrowed it down to set of specific parameters like film type etc because I almost never have to do this.</p>

<p>I hope this may answer some questions for those of you with gigantic scans of gigantic negatives that print beautifully optically but look like shit when printed digitally at small sizes or computer display sizes. I do believe that this is not common knowledge as I routinely see books published with large format negatives where the image sizes are actually smaller than the negative size and I can see grain in them - same goes for web pictures I see of large format negatives. There is NO WAY for Â this to happen in optical analog printing with negatives that size - no matter how big the grain.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. I also think this effect is part of the reason grain simulations in digital are so outrageously bad and look nothing like real film and real print sizes in the analog world. Tri-X in 35mm is virtually grainless at 5x7 and even 8x10 depending on how it was processed but digital simulations look like Tri-x pushed to 3200 and printed 16x20 even on a web sized picture that measures like 3&#8221; wide on the screen - this is a ridiculous digital distortion that happens with a less than informed work-flow and does not happen with real film and real analog prints.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/DSC_7994.jpg"><img title="DSC_7994.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/.thumbs/.DSC_7994.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_7994.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="118" align="left" /></a>Every photographer out there that has a lot of experience will tell you that you can make great photographs with just about any camera, any lens, any software, any film, any paper, etc. etc. I tell people this all the time. I have for years, especially in workshops that I have held where the focus was never what tool is required to get some desired set of results. Way back when I got my very first Hasselblad digital system I used it in a grand total of one workshop. Ever since then I use whatever the crappiest digital camera I happen to own at the time.</p>

<p>The reason for this is immediately after I hoisted the $30,000 camera rig and fired of the very first frame that showed up on my tethered large LCD the conversations for the participants changed from what they should be to the object of wonder, lust, and desire that was the digital &#8216;blad. Now I use my Nikon D2h and there is never a thought that anyone has to run out and grab one to make good images. The funny thing is I didn&#8217;t even like using that beast of a &#8216;blad that much. About the only saving grace was that it did put out good files and the viewfinder was big and juicy. This does not mean that I don&#8217;t believe that photographers should really really like their tools - I do, I really really do. They just should not confuse the enjoyment of the materials with that matter at had to produce results. I personally want both. When I enjoy the tools materials, and process end to end - I feel better.</p>

<p>That brings me to the point - we all have really special relationships with our equipment and materials and we all have what we like the best and it is completely true you can make really great images with just about any equipment/materials/etc. That is not even close to saying you will like using that equipment, those materials, or that process. If you shoot commercial images sometimes you must use equipment/processes/materials you do not enjoy. Shooting images that you want to shoot with nobody to please but yourself is a completely different story - there is no reason whatsoever to use what you do not like or do not enjoy. For the most part there is overlap - thank goodness.</p>

<p>When it comes to image processing software it is a little different. For the most part enjoyment is not part of the equation - you may enjoy the results but rarely do you enjoy the software. I may be going a little overboard here but Apple Aperture changed that for me, and for a lot of other photographers that I know. For the first time I enjoyed using a piece of image processing software in the same way I really enjoy some of my other tools and materials. I really enjoy Â a lot of my simple cameras and simple lenses, finely crafted objects of beauty and function - but still simple. I really enjoy some of the analog film materials that I use - I find the materials in and of themselves beautiful, finely crafted, and capable of producing beautiful finely crafted end results.</p>

<p>So if you have the choice - using fantastically beautiful tools and materials every step of the way that produce the results you also find beautiful why would you not want to use them? Yea I could use other things that I don&#8217;t find as attractive - that I don&#8217;t like as much and get the same results - but why?</p>

<p>Call me strange but I not only want to love the results, I want to enjoy and appreciate the tools and materials that I use to get them to. Forget that - you don&#8217;t have to call me strange - I know I am but I am strange in the way not a whole lot of the population is - I guess that is why I am a photographer. I may take it a little overboard considering I even use films and developers that produce negatives that have a beauty in and of themselves rather than something that produce the same end results in a print but the intermediate product is not quite as &#8220;nice&#8221;.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. Evidence of strangeness = take the image of PXP at the top of the post. I even find black and white negatives beautiful in and of themselves.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As most of you do - I also like to keep up to date on things going on with Photography. All sides and aspects of it. Even if I do not participate in one genre or another. Even if my preferences are completely opposed to a particular style, or material, or technique, I have a healthy respect for things that are not my cup of tea and have a genuine interest in keeping up with what is going on - photographically. The only way to do that is that I have to keep an open mind and give things a chance even if my first reaction is one of dismissal. Every once in a while my initial reaction is absolutely wrong, most of the time it is right. That is the price you pay in time and psychological aggravation to allow yourself to be open to new things and to continue learning in the great journey of life.</p>

<p>Okay - so why the not so open minded title. Well I take in so much crap in my desire for knowledge and understanding that every once in a while I really have to vent a little tiny bit of hatefulness. Take it as my little edutainment segment. So here is my hate list of the week.</p>

<p>I hate pretentiousness in art - be it naive pretentiousness, be it subconscious pretentiousness, be it not well thought out random pretentiousness. I really don&#8217;t care if it is accidental and unintended or on purpose. I hate it with a passion. Unfortunately I love art - especially really really great photographic art. To get to that you really have to put up with a lot of nonsense. I kind of poked a little fun at this kind of thing a while back in my fine art photography lesson. I hope I didn&#8217;t give the impression that I do not have deep respect for photographic artists - I do. To put a project together and really do something worthwhile takes a lot of work. Maybe a lifetime of work. It usually is apparent, even if you don&#8217;t like the work - the work part is pretty apparent and stands on it&#8217;s own merits.</p>

<p>On behalf those out there that have put in the work and those that are putting in the work I have to be insulted when I run across &#8220;artists&#8221; selling their prints on-line where there is no evidence whatsoever of &#8220;the work&#8221;. Example, I listen to a lot of interviews with photographers. While I am listening I like to flip through the &#8220;work&#8221; they are talking about. Art photographers call pictures &#8220;work&#8221;, that&#8217;s okay it can be a lot of work - except when it&#8217;s not. In a particular interview I was listening to this week, I fired up the ole web browser and started to look through the artist&#8217;s &#8220;body of work&#8221; for not one but a couple separate Â &#8221;bodies of work&#8221; as the interview was going on in the background.</p>

<p>These &#8220;bodies of work&#8221; were called something like &#8220;so and so and so I&#8221; and &#8220;so and so and so II&#8221;. Here is what we got - a dozen or so really really blurry square black and white dark pictures all titled &#8220;untitled&#8221; of random shit laying around the living room, dining room, bedroom, and kitchen of the same house - most likely on the same day - even more likely on the same roll of film. The &#8220;so and so and so II&#8221; Â &#8221;body of work&#8221; was probably the same day on a different roll of film. Wait - here is the punch line - they also all had the title of untitled - and both &#8220;bodies of work&#8221; not only where the pictures titled untitled - here it comes - every single one of them, every single one had a title of &#8220;untitled (xxxxxxxxx)&#8221; where the xxxxxxxx part was like knife, remote, shelf paper. The icing on the cake was the audio interview explaining that the &#8220;work&#8221; represented a very very dark place in the artists life, lots of banter and allusion to drag the dark place on and on so the interviewer could drag the emotion out - this work represents the dark place that was going on during the long agonizing &#8220;death of a loved father&#8221;. This is also in the &#8220;artists statement&#8221;. Not a big secret.</p>

<p>Honestly I don&#8217;t know if any of the words are even true but it doesn&#8217;t really matter. If you need to be explicit in that kind of thing to generate some sort of emotional whatever that is pretentious - really. I could not careless if this artist sells prints or not. I do take it as an affront to all of the really really hard work put in by countless photographic artists throughout history - not to sell prints - but to make art. The outrageous arrogance that this &#8220;artist&#8221; has in believing that a roll of film or two through his/her new toy Holga qualifies as &#8220;fine art&#8221; because it looked cool is absolutely stunning. Hey look how cool the remote control looks when it is blurry - it&#8217;s art - now it&#8217;s for sale.</p>

<p>More hate next week.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. Feel free to agree/disagree or whatever - Please do not take this as I think there is no really good photographic art made with less than outstanding sharpness - take a look at Keith Carter or someone like that. My issue is that it is a shame for people like KC et al that any yo-yo that picks up a camera that makes blurry pictures of untitled (shelf paper) is in the same league and is at all representative of the &#8220;work&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/full.jpg"><img title="full.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/.thumbs/.full.jpg" border="0" alt="full.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="94" align="left" /></a>I was actually working with Aperture on my beautiful new Macbook Pro unibody yesterday and rediscovered one of the joys of using the software. I never really forgot about it, I just had a renewed appreciation for it&#8217;s wonderfulness. I thought I would share and reintroduce some of the subtle but really useful touches that Aperture provides that allow you to work more productively while we are all waiting for that Aperture 3/Aperture X goodness.</p>

<p>One of the things that I use all the time even on my giant displays is the ever useful &#8220;I&#8221; key. While nice on a giant monitor, it is a godsend on a laptop. Just hit the I key and the inspector panes go away. Hit &#8220;I&#8221; again and they are back. Really wonderful but wait there is more. Shift &#8220;I&#8221; moves the inspector panes from the left side of the screen to the right side and back. Not terribly useful but if you like it better on once side or the other you have a choice. Never underestimate the power of &#8220;liking it better&#8221;, it can be the difference between one of the little things throughout the day that doesn&#8217;t have to go against your grain. Sort of a feng-shui kind of thing.</p>

<p>A couple of other really nice touches that you may have forgotten about but can come in really handy are the ever not so popular Shift-W and Option-W. Shift-W, officially known as rotate<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/horz.jpg"><img title="horz.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/.thumbs/.horz.jpg" border="0" alt="horz.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="92" align="right" /></a> browser position takes the browser strip and swaps it from running horizontally to running vertically. Option-W, swap browser position, flips the browser strip from left to right or top to bottom. These two features in combination with the &#8220;I&#8221; and Shift-I work wonders on a laptop and are actually very useful on just about any monitor when maximizing screen real estate <a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/vert.jpg"><img title="vert.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/.thumbs/.vert.jpg" border="0" alt="vert.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="92" align="left" /></a>for the job at hand - along with a healthy dose of personal preference.</p>

<p>Of course never forget the unsung heros of screen real estate maximization, &#8220;D&#8221; and Shift-D. The D key hides and shows the Â &#8221;control bar&#8221;. That way it isn&#8217;t taking up any screen space when not in use, but more importantly it is not there bugging the living crap out of me. Even if you love the control bar, that doesn&#8217;t mean it has to be there when you are not using it. Shift-D toggles the control bar between rating functions and keyword controls. Depending on what I am doing some times I use keyword controls and<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/swap.jpg"><img title="swap.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/.thumbs/.swap.jpg" border="0" alt="swap.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="92" align="right" /></a> sometimes I use pre-assigned function key groups to keyword my images. When I am not key-wording it is not there taking up space and cluttering things up. I almost never use the rating function control bar, I use shortcut keys.</p>

<p>I have used the shortcut keys to describe some of Aperture&#8217;s subtle but very nice UI customization features but they are also available under the View-&gt;Browser menu and the Window menu. I really like that this stuff is available via shortcut keys, it makes it really fast. Here is a tip that I have mentioned more than a few times to get to know the keyboard shortcuts - go to the menu and look at the shortcut. Instead of using the menu item actually use the key. This may cost you a little bit of time the first three or four times but the amount of wasted motion that it saves for the next 85,394 times will pay you back in a big way.</p>

<p>One other thing to remember about Aperture and the UI customization features, all the customization features for that matter. They are not checkboxes in the preferences dialog and they have shortcut keys for a good reason. This is not a matter of set it and forget it. You can really benefit both productivity wise and enjoyment wise by very very quickly tailoring Aperture to what you are doing right here and now - dynamically. When other more casual Aperture users see me use Aperture on my laptop using the &#8220;I&#8221;, &#8220;W&#8221;, Shift-W, etc they really Â don&#8217;t see me using the keys they just see Aperture transform itself to suit my desires in the blink of an eye. Without fail they ask me &#8220;how&#8217;d ya do that, I didn&#8217;t know you could do that, cool&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In case you have not seen this before, I wanted to share some links to a pair of professional wedding photographers that switched from Lightroom 2 to Aperture 2. Now here is the punch line - THEY ARE NIKON SHOOTERS. Yep, that is right Nikon wedding photographers that switched from Lightroom 2 to Aperture 2.</p>

<p>I know I complain about a couple of nagging things, including NEF conversion and WB handling in Aperture but trust me, if Aperture was not the best tool for workflow and organization and&#8230; I would have switched a long time ago. I own both, I know both inside and out. I know how to convert just about everything I care about. One of the things that is becoming more and more clear to me is that photographers that want a really better way of interacting with their libraries as a whole and are very demanding of the environment in which they spend their time prefer Aperture. Especially photographers that have a general bent towards &#8220;strait&#8221; photography. Photographers that spend lots of time manipulating their images and are satisfied with the file system facilities to organize their images and the work associated with those images seem to prefer Lightroom.</p>

<p>To me Lightroom seems like a smarted up version of Bridge or Bridge a dumbed down version of Lightroom. They have become even closer with CS4.</p>

<p>On to the videos - check them out if you have time.</p>

<p>The other thing that is pretty amazing is that this guy makes his money shooting weddings - not selling Aperture add-ons or education. Aperture users that have seen the light are pretty enthusiastic folks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wanted to share with those of you that frequent the site (not via search or links to specific posts) some random thoughts and updates about the site. One thing that you may have noticed is the glaringly ugly Paypal button on the left hand side of the posts. Yep it&#8217;s ugly and I hate to ugly up the site but I really need to make the whole thing cost neutral in 2010. If you find anything of value about Aperture, etc. I would really appreciate anything that you can afford - $1, $5, $10, $3.42 - whatever.</p>

<p>I have decided to do this because the site is not &#8220;you gotta have this thing&#8221; focused and I do not embed a lot of &#8220;you gotta buy this&#8221; links in the posts. I am affiliated with a grand total of two retailers that pay chump change for referrals - Amazon and B+H - only because I use them frequently myself. Some of you have decided to purchase a few items here and there via Amazon and one person from B+H, I really do thank those of you thad did but&#8230; That brought in $72 for 2009 - this doesn&#8217;t cover my hosting - just another thing for the significant other to complain about. The big reason is not the amount of traffic I get it is the amount of things I write about - like Aperture - that most of the visitors already own in combination with the way other sites cheat on affiliate programs like Amazon, etc. Namely they use cookie stuffing - you visit the site, you end up with the sites code for every affiliate program known to man kind without even clicking on anything - it&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t have the capability to do this - I am quite astute - I just find it morally unsettling. Hopefully the donate thing will help me make this cost neutral in 2010.</p>

<p>On another note - I made my commitment to Aperture public yesterday. I intend to continue to update and share my thoughts on Aperture 2 and hopefully Aperture 3 even if I am the last one standing. Why? Because I use it and I like it and it saves me time. Not because it is the most popular or profitable thing to write about on the internet. Trust me I get about 2000-3000 hits a day - not a lot but not too shabby either for a personal blog that talks about really specialized things and that happens with no tricky keyword business of trying to drive traffic to the site that has nothing to do with what people are looking for.</p>

<p>Funny example - guess what the number one post was for the last two days? Remember that silly &#8220;Most Glamourous Ever&#8221; post? Yep in the last two days that has generated the most views by a wide margin with everything else spread out evenly. The two search terms that got people to the post were &#8220;Raquel Welsh&#8221; and &#8220;Catherine Zeta-Jones&#8221; - I am sure that I am like 50 pages down the list but haven&#8217;t checked. Funny.</p>

<p>Have a great weekend everybody.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2009_006_02.jpg"><img title="2009_006_02.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2009_006_02.jpg" border="0" alt="2009_006_02.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" align="left" /></a>Well I finally took the plunge, I have searched out inexpensive film and decided to try Efke 100. Not just try it but calibrate it and get to know it. As you may have gathered I am a Kodak film shooter for the most part. The reason I am searching for cheaper film is that I am working on a few projects that are requiring quite a bit of 8x10 film. If you haven&#8217;t checked lately Kodak 8x10 is hideously expensive, not a big deal if I shoot a couple of sheets a month but I am planning on shooting a lot. I happened to search for low priced 8x10 film and can get Efke 100 at about half the cost of Kodak. Still not cheap but half of ridiculous is less than full ridiculous.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t go full bore hog wild and acquire a couple hundred dollars worth of the stuff without getting to know it a little bit I took a short cut - a low cost short cut. I bought 5 rolls of 120 to test and calibrate it to my developer and my process. Here are a couple of things I have found so far and I am only finished the first roll. The first thing is that it seems to be a lot less red/yellow/orange sensitive than my regular 100 speed film (Kodak TMX). I found this out not by making a direct comparison but by making a couple of mistakes while shooting the first roll. Namely I instinctively shot a landscape with a green filter - usually appropriate to darken up the sky and brighten the foreground but in this case I saw that it was clearly the wrong choice after making a few exposures. The foliage was not green it was yellow and orange - it&#8217;s fall. So I switched to an orange filter. Of course I shot the scene without any filtration as well. Based on my experience with the way these filters react and the way that I know TMX reacts, I can tell that Efke 100 is less red sensitive.</p>

<p>Of course the grain is way bigger than TMX but who cares in 8x10 - not a problem. The other thing<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2009_006_02_40x.jpg"><img title="2009_006_02_40x.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2009_006_02_40x.jpg" border="0" alt="2009_006_02_40x.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" align="right" /></a> that I learned is that the film looks way different when processing it than any other film I have ever used. It looked fine when I first hung it up to dry. After a few minutes when I walked back into the darkroom and saw it I thought that it was horribly flawed. It really looked like the film base was made from frosted glass. My instant reaction was that somehow I had reticulated the emulsion while processing it. I thought this because I knew that my wash was 1 degree F cooler than the rest of my process. Normally this would not be an issue to even consider but other peoples general opinion was that Efke 100 had a very fragile emulsion.</p>

<p>I took this with a grain of salt since most peoples development process is all over the map compared to what I consider careful handling. So I immediately said to my self that this level of fragility was idiotic and definitely wouldn&#8217;t do if a 1 degree difference in the wash was enough to completely destroy the film. Here is the punch line - after the film dried completely overnight it was perfect with a perfectly clear clean base. So it maybe fragile but not that insane. The frosty fogginess while drying looks to be normal. Thank god - the 8x10 cheap Efke 100 is still a go.</p>

<p>Compared to TMX and PXP Efke 100 seems to be a bit slower maybe like 2/3 of a stop slower in the shadows a couple more rolls and I will know exactly what speed it is in the shadows. Of course this maybe developer dependent but I am speaking from a common developer for all three. I really do like the gradation and overall curve of the films response. I am going to shoot it against TMX so that I can accurately compare the two characteristic curves just for academic reasons but Efke has a very pretty upper midrange and rich midtone gradation in general.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2009_006_02_8x.jpg"><img title="2009_006_02_8x.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2009_006_02_8x.jpg" border="0" alt="2009_006_02_8x.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" align="left" /></a>The couple of things that I do not like about it can be managed. The first thing is that the film base is really thin, cheap and curly. The included scans are not even close to critically sharp because there was no way to get the film flat in my glassless holders for scanning - I am going to have to use a hydraulic press for like a week to get this stuff flat. The other thing that really doesn&#8217;t matter but could is the lack of quality control is pretty evident even from the burned out blown out, and inconsistent edge numbers on the Efke. Obviously this is not in an of itself an issue but if it is a harbinger for other quality control problems that may be a concern. For now it is a go forward with the Efke 8x10 - if I run into specific quality or consistency issues I will post a note on what exactly they are later on.</p>

<p>I processed this sample in Pyrocat HD 1+1+100. My standard developer for a number of reasons - if anyone cares I will be glad to share why I use it. As usual the middle image is the obligatory &#8220;100%&#8221; at 40x magnification, can&#8217;t really tell much about a film from looking at that besides it is grainier than TMX and it is sharp. I may go with a new policy on showing films under magnification, the last image is the image at 8x - that would be a tiny piece of a 20&#8221; x 20&#8221; print - most likely I will not even print this big, it just happens to be the biggest loupe I own and how I inspect film visually. Let me know what you think about the 8x vs the 40x - personally I think the 8x tells you a lot more about the film. The development was just about N (normal) based on my measurements and metering - that was a surprise given it was the first roll. I really like the way it separates subtle tones at N processing. The only manipulation was to make the film base black the rest of it is a raw scan. Even this crappy unfiltered test shot would look fantastic with about 2 minutes of dodging and burning. I declare Efke 100 pretty nice for half the cost of TMX - I think I will really like it in 8x10.</p>

<p>Wish me luck with the Cheap 8x10. Obviously I am going to shoot and calibrate the rest of the 120 before purchasing the 8x10.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As many of you may have heard over the last week or so a book appeared on Amazon that had Aperture X in the title. It was available for pre-order with availability in the Spring of 2010. This has led to a lot of chatter about an imminent release of the next major version of Aperture. The word on the street is the release will be rebranded as Aperture X to align it with OS X or something like that.</p>

<p>While I have no specific knowledge of Apple&#8217;s release plans or naming strategy I have heard from a lot of sources that I consider reliable that we will be getting a major Aperture update very very soon. This wouldn&#8217;t surprise me at all and I hope soon means this year. Just so we can all see what it does, make our decisions on what software we use. and get on with our work. I thought that I would share a couple of my own thoughts on Aperture versus Lightroom and my own plans, considering I answer that question either in person or via email about 100 times a day.</p>

<p>To make a long story short - I plan to stick with Aperture for the foreseeable future for my own use. The only way that I would switch to Lightroom is if there were such significant features and improvements released by Adobe that it would actually make my life better, save me a lot of time, and cause me to enjoy spending time in Lightroom. You heard that right - I know Lightroom very well, I think it is a great piece of software, but I do not enjoy it at all. I actually enjoy organizing in Aperture. For what I do and what I care about Aperture still leaves Lightroom in the dust. When working with my photos in Lightroom I feel boxed in or something. I really do not like the separate library, develop, etc modes in Lightroom. I do not think that a lot of the organizational tools are all that flexible or thought out, stacks are virtually useless, etc.</p>

<p>This may surprise you considering how much I complain about default NEF processing in Aperture among other things but those things are minor compared to how slow working in Lightroom is for me. I am glad that Adobe released the Lightroom 3 beta - there is nothing that I want or better said Â - nothing revolutionary that causes me to want to switch. My commitment to Aperture (for my personal photography and my personal library) is solid and if any of you were wondering - as soon as Aperture 3 or Aperture X hits the streets I will have it and will continue trying to explain the best way to use it to all of the loyal readers out there.</p>

<p>Here is a promise - when it comes out I will dedicate 100% of my focus to update and expand my Aperture guides to be better, stronger, and include all of the Aperture X/Aperture 3 goodness as soon as it is humanly possible to produce with a degree of quality and accuracy that I am comfortable with.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. Obviously the only other reason I would switch is if Apple themselves made it very clear there was no Aperture future - as in the product is cancelled.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple of times I have lamented the passing of Polaroid Corp. Sure I really miss the materials that I shot, especially Polaroid Type 55 P/N in large format. I even miss the color materials that I of course tried but never really used in any quantities or as an artistic medium. The one thing that never came through in those passing mentions of how sad I was that some of the materials itself are gone was how sad I was that the Polaroid company itself was gone.</p>

<p>Why this makes me sad is a really complicated and difficult issue to describe. Of all the companies related to photography that there are and that were, Polaroid had a very special relationship to photographers and the art of photography that grew up with film. I have had a couple of off-line conversations with some other people that understand this like I do but <a href="http://www.insideanalogphoto.com/inside-analog-photo-radio-20x24-polaroid/272">this interview</a>, especially the second half of it, does a fantastic job of putting the whole thing into words that I could never do.</p>

<p>If you are into photography, like really into it, you need to listen to the <a href="http://www.insideanalogphoto.com/inside-analog-photo-radio-20x24-polaroid/272">interview with John Reuter over on the &#8220;Inside Analog Photo Radio&#8221; site</a>. Even if you came up and are digital, understanding a little bit of history is a good thing.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. Holy crap - am I turning into some sort of activist or something?</p>

<p>Pss. Sorry for the confusion - I just updated the links to contain the real meat of the interview - the Audi0. The video portion is nice but nothing compared to the audio interview.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/1999_009_09.jpg"><img title="1999_009_09.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.1999_009_09.jpg" border="0" alt="1999_009_09.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="102" height="150" align="left" /></a>A while ago I mentioned the concept of &#8220;important&#8221; images. My thoughts are that the pictures you make of people that are close to you are the most important ones that you will ever make. Not the abstract that win you third prize in the local art show. Not the ones that you make for advertisements that may pay the bills, etc. etc. Paying the bills is important but the images themselves are really not that important.</p>

<p>Here is a small example of what I am talking about. Take these couple of images. They are just a few of the images that I casually shot of daughter number 2. Amazing changes. The funny thing is that all of these are inside a space of under 2 years. While it is true that you will never take the same image twice or capture that same moment in time even if you shoot a tree in your garden or the beach or the lake. This is so much more true of people.</p>

<p>One of the things that I find amazing and sad. Is how much a lot of pro photographers do<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/1999_024_04.jpg"><img title="1999_024_04.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.1999_024_04.jpg" border="0" alt="1999_024_04.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="right" /></a>not shoot the people that are close to them because it is too much like work. Even more astonishing to me is that a lot of photography oriented web <a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2000_005_16.jpg"><img title="2000_005_16.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2000_005_16.jpg" border="0" alt="2000_005_16.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="left" /></a>sites that you will visit put so little emphasis on how important this is. In fact a lot of sites that I run across treat images of people close to them as some how subservient to other photographic endeavors. I have seen pro after pro drone on incessantly about how to do landscape well and what equipment to use to light models and what cameras are the best for getting maximum quality for wildlife, etc, etc. when mentioning what they use or how they take images of people close to them they treat it like an afterthought. &#8220;Oh just any old digicam, it doesn&#8217;t really<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2000_050_29.jpg"><img title="2000_050_29.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2000_050_29.jpg" border="0" alt="2000_050_29.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="right" /></a>matter&#8221;. I find this very disturbing.</p>

<p>I may be taking it a bit far here but I actually find it insulting to most people and why most people value photography. More dangerously than just being insulting, I really don&#8217;t like the subtext that somehow shooting the people close to you is not as important as shooting a landscape or a model or whatever the more &#8220;professional&#8221; endeavor is.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2001-019-05_1.jpg"><img title="2001-019-05_1.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2001-019-05_1.jpg" border="0" alt="2001-019-05_1.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" align="left" /></a>Just had to say this. Sorry for the rant.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. Since about 2 years old daughter number 2 has insisted on doing her own thing with the hair. So the style is all hers. She&#8217;s pretty good at it now. Could you tell her favorite activity is drama (as in plays/acting)</p>
