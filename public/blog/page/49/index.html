  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hey people,</p>

<p>This is why I could never be a teacher. My head would explode. Maybe I need a cooling rod like the Scorpious guy on Farscape from a few years back, for those of you who are not familiar with the series, Scorpious is a bad guy that has a chamber that unscrews from the side of his head so that he can service rods that cool his brain and stop him from going completely insane. I feel the need for one now.</p>

<p>As I have mentioned, I get about 200 emails a week regarding questions about Aperture and try my best to help those that write in. It&#8217;s Saturday and I have responded to most of them but&#8230;.</p>

<p>I really really need some help from you folks with this one. My eyes rolled so far back into my head that I don&#8217;t know if they will ever go back to normal.</p>

<p>Anyone care to answer this one for me?????????</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p><em>Dear Sir
I&#8217;m a photographer from Israel.
</em></p>

<p><em>
</em></p>

<p><em>Some time ago I&#8217;ve found your website, and I enjoy it very much. I find it very interesting and useful.
I have a problem and hope you would be able to help.
I am shooting with a Nikon D2X on Raw format. I used Nikon Viewnx/transfer for importing photos (or iView MediaPro3) and Capture NX2 for editing,
and saved the edited photos again in Raw.
About 3 months ago i have switched from PC to Imac 24&#8221; 3.06 GB and bought Aperture 2 software.
I continued importing and viewing files with Nikon Viewnx/transfer, editing with Capture NX2, and saving the edited files in RawÂ  format.
Then I imported the edited Raw files to Aperture 2 as referenced files.
The images I get in Aperture 2 are very different from those I edited in Capture NX2 and those I view in Viewnx (they look darker and &#8220;dull&#8221;).
Imported Tiff and jpeg files do not &#8220;suffer&#8221; from this problem, and look exactly the same.
Therefor I avoide using my new Aperture 2.
I&#8217;d appreciate very much your advise.</em></p>

<p><em>Thanks a lot
</em>&lt;Name redacted&gt;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I thought the last post would help with the emails but no&#8230;.</p>

<p>One question really stood out though. &#8220;Why are you an Aperture guy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hmmm&#8230;.</p>

<p>What comes to mind is that I understand complexity but love simplicity and I Aperture seems to be an expression of that in the way that my brain works. I would guess that it is the best expression of that that I happen to have seen when it comes to image processing software.</p>

<p>Hell, I understand exactly how it works, and how it expresses itself to the world. Amazing. From my perspective people having issues undersnading Aperture have to do with two things. First, people that think they know &#8220;what they are doing&#8221; that do not like to tell the software exactly what to do (in reality they have no idea what they are doing and are used to being 100&amp; in conrol, nice fantacy). Second people that think both cameras and computers are magic.</p>

<p>I guess the big or not so big annoncement for the &#8220;pro-apps&#8221; is coming up in about 3 weeks, I guess there will have to be a quiz or so on what people want and what they expect.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, so I am not the fastest news source on the block. Here it is anyway. OS 10.5.7 is out as you probably know from every other Apple news source including your upgrade icon bouncing around in the dock. What you may not have heard is there are reports coming in from all over the place on the effects of upgrading.</p>

<p>Of course the reports of &#8220;hey I upgraded and everything broke&#8221; are out there as usual. That is not what is interesting. What is interesting is that numerous sources are reporting that there are performance gains everywhere from mild to drastic. What&#8217;s more is that there are some people claiming that Aperture positively rocks after the upgrade with no other changes. I have heard this from a couple of sources and it seems to correlate well with non-Aperture users reporting improvements in various graphics and streaming video related activities.</p>

<p>My own upgrade seems to have produced a mild dose of additional snappiness, your milage may vary. By my cound about 1000 fellow Aperture users visit the site per day at the moment so if you have any reports related to Aperture performance post 10.5.7 I am sure others would be interested in what you see - comment away with your experience - good, bad, or indifferent.</p>

I thought why not start with the hardest, Nik Color EFX Pro. It&#8217;s not hard to use, hard to understand, or hard to copy and paste a list of all of the stuff it does from another source. Heck it&#8217;s not even hard to make example images for each and every one of its filters. I guess the hard thing for me is to figure out what I can contribute that would be helpful that I have not seen at a thousand review sites, on Nik software&#8217;s own site, or a gazillion forum sites.</div>

It was released quite a while ago in digital camera equipment years - like dog years or something. What&#8217;s new are my thoughts on it after having played with one for a few minutes. I am not going to say playing with it for a few minutes revealed anything super duper spectacular interms of what I expected. I am definitely not going to say something rediculous like &#8220;I was looking at the shots on the back of the camera and this has to be the best lens ever&#8221;. </div>

If you are using Aperture you know how to import images, hit the little down arrow import icon, choose import images&#8230; from the file menu, or use command-I. Pretty basic. I have received quite a few questions regarding importing so I thought I would share a couple of the finer points that can speed up your work-flow. Did you know that there are three different ways to import into Aperture that do three distinctly different things? I am not speaking of the three ways to invoke import images, or managed vs. referenced. </div>

To make a long story short the technique uses a corner as a background. The surface facing the light source will be light and happens to be on the shadow side of the subject. The opposite surface will be darker and on the highlight side of the subject. </div>

I continue to be amazed and at the same time horrified by the state of affairs with photography in general. I guess what I am amazed with is the degree of progress in terms of the technology. When the Nikon D1 was released I used one, I didn&#8217;t own it but I had the opportunity to use an associate&#8217;s camera on a number of occasions. In and around that time I was shooting a Nikon F5. </div>
