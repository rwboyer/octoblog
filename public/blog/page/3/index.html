  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yep,</p>

<p>One day after playing with Final Cut Pro X I decided to plunk down my money for FCP X and Motion 5. I know opinions will vary on what software is best for who but for the most part if you do not have a very very specific reason that you cannot use FCP X, I believe that you are far better off learning it than toiling away with just about any other solution.</p>

<p>I cannot believe that I already got a couple of hate eMails about how much I do not know regarding video, etc, etc. While this may be true, as well as the fact that for a couple of very very specific cases where FCP 7 may fit better into an existing work-flow or environment I still stand by my statement that FCP X is way faster - both technically and more importantly conceptually as long as you embrace the way it is supposed to work. I haven&#8217;t even begun to scratch the surface of becoming &#8220;productive&#8221; with it by maximizing the best way to do things but even doing a small job and being minimally familiar with it I can already see how it will save a ton of time.</p>

<p>If you are at all looking to do video and cannot sort out what is what when it comes to FCP X <a href="http://library.creativecow.net/garchow_jeremy/FCPX-Ask/1">here is a decent read to give you a feeling of why there is so much animosity towards the upgrade</a>. With a few well justified exceptions most of the angry mob is just part of the internet echo chamber where at the moment it seems to be cool to hate FCP X. In the referenced post above the most illustrative thing is the debate between the author (seems like a well balanced look at things) and an FCP X hater. I hope you find some of the &#8220;justification&#8221; of dispersions cast has hilarious as I do - you know things like &#8220;the default preferences don&#8217;t assume multiple monitors&#8221; and such. Ha.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hey, I&#8217;m a guy, so when I get a brand spanking new, extremely complicated device like a new piece of software I don&#8217;t read anything about it - like the instructions. I dive right in and do non-clinical testing. After I got done with <em>real</em> work today I chucked my very very first FCP X test together. Does it suck? Yes. Do I know what I am doing yet? Ummm, No. I can tell you that I learned a heck of a lot about the software in my tiny little bit of testing so it can&#8217;t be that tuff to learn.</p>

<p>My main goal was to at least get comfortable with the basic workings and behavior of the new FCP. My secondary goal was to chuck everything I could at it as fast as I could to see if I could break it. I used an iMac 27&#8221; Sandy Bridge with 4 core i7 2gig VRAM and 16gig RAM connected to two monitors. The reset of the test went something like this&#8230;</p>

<ol>
    <li>Shoot about a minute of StupidCrap™ 1080p HD at 24 fps with the Nikon D7000 - I choose to shoot my dusty old guitar amp and some of my film processing supplies that are in the corner.</li>
    <li>Grab about 400 random StupidCrap™ images lying about in Aperture - these are strait out of the camera JPEGs that I don&#8217;t even remember when I shot. Interesting because they even include all my rejects. Interesting fact - the video and all the images were shot with the same lens over the last decade. A Nikon AFS 28-70 f 2.8 that I picked up in 1999 - one set of the stills was even shot on Portra way way back. Who would have thought I would be using that lens to do crap like this.</li>
    <li>Use lots of rendering effects and a couple of grading layers to spice things up. Heck I even used some cheesy ones that I don&#8217;t like on top of a couple I do like. One thing I did learn is that I am going to most likely build my own rendering effects like the flashes you see in Motion 5 to suit my tastes.</li>
    <li>Chuck in a cool song and do a lousy job at timing transitions to song changes.</li>
    <li>Spend about 15 minutes smashing it all together.</li>
</ol>


<p>Here is what I learned:</p>

<ul>
    <li>There are a ton of useful transitions, effects, etc. bundled with FCP X. Having said that if you value subtlety it would really pay off for you to pay the extra 49 bucks for Motion 5 so you can do your one. I am.</li>
    <li>FCP X is fast. I could not get it to choke no matter what I did. The background rendering in no way inhibited me from working and caught up with me unbelievably fast.</li>
    <li>Did I say fast - it rendered an H.264 quicktime file output of my finished StupidCrap™ movie in under a minute. That&#8217;s fast.</li>
    <li>The organizational capabilities for your media are fantastic. If you like Aperture you will LOVE FCP X.</li>
    <li>Almost everything you need is in FCP X - not a lot of need for a bunch of other Apps. I did mention Motion 5 but that is really only for building effects, etc. Once you do they along with any parameters you publish for them are available in the FCP X inspector just like the ones it comes with. Very cool.</li>
    <li>Even though this was StupidCrap™ I can tell you for a fact that doing the exact same thing in FCP 7 would have taken me 4 or 5 times as long - maybe longer. Partially due to the apps speed but more due to how easy and slick things work in the new app. Amazing once you get the hang of it you can fly. Maybe I am the only one on the planet who thinks this but for the most part things work like you would think they would - every thing is very&#8230; direct - not like FCP 7.</li>
    <li>Everything you see is pretty much my first try - take a look at how smooth and clean all the machinations are on both the HD and the rendering of the stills. I swear I used to have to futz with things till the cows came home in FCP 7 to get it soooo smoooooth. iMovie - forget it.</li>
</ul>


<p>For your entertainment. Extra bonus points if you can guess how many different stills I actually chucked in here&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I briefly brought up the stepped up video capabilities of my new Nikon D7000. As you might have assumed, I am not particularly interested in DSLR video for my personal projects but since I get it for free on a camera I own I may just give it a little bit of effort and time.</p>

<p>I am no stranger to nonlinear video editing and have worked on a few medium sized projects with real pros in the past. In fact I am an advocate of video software for still photo presentations and use both iMovie as well as the older versions Final Cut for just that purpose. It&#8217;s amazing what you can accomplish with iMovie and a few minutes of your time. When needed I usually opt for an iMovie &#8220;slide show&#8221; versus using Aperture&#8217;s built in tools. If you haven&#8217;t played with iMovie and your still photos, you really should give it a try.</p>

<p>Moving on to the matter at hand - what about FCP X? Well considering that my <em>need</em> for slide shows has not been overwhelming, I already own FCP 7, and other factors I have largely ignored FCP X. That is about to change.</p>

<p>As of today you can download a <a href="http://www.apple.com/finalcutpro/">trial version of FCP X</a> from apple. I did and was blown away. First off do not listen to all the curmugeons out there that lament the passing of a couple of old FCP features and capabilities. Anyone shooting HD with a DSLR, producing still slideshows, or any normal person that does not have a <strong>LONG</strong> time with older software and the biases it naturally generates towards a particular workflow will never miss those &#8220;features&#8221;.</p>

<p>FCP X is probably the best thing to happen to video editing since nonlinear editing was concevied. It is absolutely amazing as long as you don&#8217;t need a few legacy oriented features. It&#8217;s faster, easier, quicker to edit, etc, etc. It has some truely amazing capabilities out of the box. If you didn&#8217;t know any other video editing software and compared FCP X to everything else out there I cannot believe that other offerings would be of any interest to you at all.</p>

<p>Ask yourself this question - Have you EVER seen older digital technology that far far far surpasses newer approachs? Maybe once that happened temporarily (can you say Windows) but for the most part newer is better when it comes to digital technology. In this case I can say (being mainly a still photographer) that FCP X is WAY better than what has come before. More stable? who knows, maybe not yet. Able to drop into decade old work-flows with no changes and letting people work <em>exactly</em> the way they are used to using video editors - ummmm no. Better conceptually and in a lot of ways more capable? - Absolutely.</p>

<p>No matter whether you shoot stills and need to produce some slick audio visuals or if you are getting into HD in any kind of serious way you owe it to yourself to give the trial a spin. Some of the really cool cataloging, keywording, and such may be familiar to all of you Aperture users but be forewarned - if you have not played with a pro-level video editor before it will take some amount of time investment to really explore and grasp what FCP X is capable of doing. Don&#8217;t waste you 30 days - set aside some real time to explore it with a fresh set of eyes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, I have been playing around with my new Nikon D7000 and I have to say this is by far my favorite DX sensor sized camera that I have owned. Yes it has it&#8217;s flaws but it&#8217;s good, especially considering the $1000 price tag. Really good. In fact the it&#8217;s the first Nikon that I have used that the video actually looks and more importantly <em>works</em> competetively with other maker&#8217;s DSLR video offerings. I know I will probably hear from the canon or panasonic folk about how much <em>better</em> their choice is for whatever hairsplitting reasons they have but make no mistake this may be the first Nikon DSLR where you actually you buy it for all of the traditional Nikon strengths and then discover how amazingly good the video is.</p>

<p>One item of note is that ever single AF Nikon lens that I own needed some degree of &#8220;focus fine tuning&#8221; in the same direction for critical sharpness. I am not sure that I am done messing with the focus tuning but it&#8217;s worlds better than without. I am sure that I can figure this out but the thing that causes me some interesting circular processes is that <strong>none</strong> of my manual focus AIS Nikon lenses need anything - they are spot on. How is this possible? Especially considering that the focus fine tuning for the AF lenses seemed to improve the focus accuracy even when the AF lenses were manually focused using the little focus confirmation indicator powered by the same contrast dectection system. Hmmmm I wonder? Who cares, it works.</p>

<p>I have been working on and off to deliver the Aperture 3 presets for the D7000 that deliver Nikon color. They are a bit tricky and will probably have to end up trading off a tiny bit of an exact match to Nikon color for overall useability and general applicability. Like every Nikon Aperture processed RAW file I have ever played with there seem to be hue crossovers that don&#8217;t happen in the JPEGs or NX2 processed RAW files.</p>

<p>Datacolor&#8217;s camera profiling tool works differently than X-rite&#8217;s tool in that their solution provides an HSL &#8220;preset&#8221; to match it&#8217;s color chart. Esentially I am doing the same thing but matching Nikon software instead of a color chart standard. I may just have to buy their software to see how well it separates some of the colors that are tricky to deal with using the same method and tool set. I will bet that the don&#8217;t do any better but my curiousity usually gets the better of me and I just <em>have</em> to know. In any case I hope to have version 1 of the presets done in the next week or so.</p>

<p>On a final note I have been thinking a lot about the amount of gear that I haul with me depending on varying circumstances. As of this moment I have not settled on a personal answer for myself. I am trying to stick to something I started over a year ago. Starting with an empty bag on every outing and loading it with what I think I will <em>need</em>. I still find myself dragging too much along in most cases. Paranoia? Too much boy scout mentality. Too ambitious? Indecision? I don&#8217;t know but I am going to take a very hard look over the next couple of months at varying alternatives and try to take only what I really really <strong>need</strong>.</p>

<p>I will try to follow up with all of you that suffer from the same affliction with some of my whacky thought processes as well as some comparison photos and let you know where I went wrong and where I went right.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>And this is why I don&#8217;t go to Canada.</p>

<p>Actually my buddy Les Picker had his camera rig attacked by a bear when he was out in the wild photographing landscapes, nature, and other subjects that I try to stay as far away from as possible. <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/2011/09/02/close-encounters-of-the-bear-kind/">Here is the full scoop</a>. Neat stuff - not for me. On the other hand he does makes some very very nice images on a regular basis and has just put out a short eBook about some of his landscape images if you are into that kind of stuff. <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/ebook/">Check it out here</a>.</p>

<p>Here is an image of Les that I snapped a few weeks ago while we were out playing around with his large format camera in a stream.</p>

</a></p>

<p>Shot with a Nikon FE, 18mm Nikkor AIS, and crappy consumer grade Fuji 200 for any one that cares. Just as a note - there were no bear during this outing, just poison ivy and some shady looking &#8220;gangstas&#8221; with pants that didn&#8217;t fit correctly.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Oh&#8230; almost forgot he got back yesterday or the day before and now he is facing a FRIGGIN FLOOD as he lives right on on of the rivers that is causing all kinds of catastrophes and evacuations in the area&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You guys/gals know I like film right? Of course you do - probably too much for you digital only people. I know I know boring but I am telling you digital only shooters - I swear you may actually pick up a thing or two embedded in some of my film non-sense that I post. Just not from this post - this is just somewhere to stick this&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/2011-001-30cn.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/2011-001-30cn.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>An illustration to my probably over the top rant in response to a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rosscova/3637127435/">&#8220;film comparison&#8221; over on flickr</a>. I hope the Op doesn&#8217;t take me wrong - I am glad he shoots some film - really I am. I am always trying to be helpful but sometimes I come off a little, ummm, let&#8217;s say over-enthusiastic, no, too critical? The heck with it I don&#8217;t know, in any case, I am sorry if I hurt anyone&#8217;s feelings along the way - it is never my intent.</p>

<p>As for the image above, it is a demonstration of the <em>worst </em>possible case for film color reproduction. Well maybe not the worst but pretty friggin bad. Here is the recipe:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Find very very old Kodak Portra 160 VC in a box with a bunch of other forgotten things. This particular film expired 7/2006 according to the back of the pro-pack box. Meaning I bought it somewhere around 2002.</li>
    <li>Mistreat said film during it&#8217;s entire lifetime. I moved to TX sometime about a year after the film was purchased and then back to the mid-atlantic a couple of years ago. I know for a fact that the box the film was in was stored in an un-airconditioned garage in the sweltering TX heat and then again for two hot humid summers here in coastal Maryland.</li>
    <li>Shoot film in 2011.</li>
    <li>Process film at Walgreens.</li>
    <li>Scan film on home CrappyScan™ scanner.</li>
    <li>Shoot film in Nikon FE with a Nikkor 50mm f1.4 single coated lens made in 1965 in harsh mid-day light with my red shirt coloring the left and bottom part of the frame as well as a big blue watering can coloring the right part of the frame.</li>
    <li>Spend less than 20 seconds doing two things in Photoshop - curves layer to neutralize one of the gray squares by eye (auto tone would probably have done just as well) and a curves layer with an S-curve to somewhat simulate what printing it on a punchy RA4 paper would sorta look like.</li>
</ol>


<p>Now with all the abuse - the lowering of the speed and contrast via age and mistreatment. The somewhat shoddy quicky scan and correct job I can clearly see that the colors and neutrals are not WAY off. I can also clearly see the influence of my red shirt and blue watering can in the lighting (Digital guys learning opportunity = watch what you wear, you wouldn&#8217;t believe how it can make color casts in your images). More importantly you can see based on the color chart that blues don&#8217;t have greens in them, reds don&#8217;t have magenta in them, etc, etc. Yea they may sway one way or another away from &#8220;accurate&#8221; but they don&#8217;t have obvious horrendous casts.</p>

<p>My point here is that no matter how you slice it if you do not color correct the film scan in some way - at least some single target value. What the heck is being compared when comparing two different color films? Are you comparing what your scanner happens to crank out by default? I don&#8217;t know.</p>

<p>Now back to our regularly scheduled program.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ever have some amusing self-realizations? It doesn&#8217;t happen often, when it does I am usually amused. This happens every once in a while - I had a friend some time ago that I often confounded, confused, frustrated, and angered because the way my head works and how I arrive at conclusions were so very different than the way she got to the same place. S0 why were we friends? Because of the very notion that we arrived at the same place. I never really took any of her frustration at my thought processes seriously. In fact I didn&#8217;t really even understand what the hell she was talking about since my inner workings were so blatantly obvious to me and her thought processes were also blatantly obvious to me as well. So I really didn&#8217;t &#8220;get it&#8221; that she didn&#8217;t &#8220;get it&#8221; when it came to my completely insufficient explanations of my inner gear grinding.</p>

<p>How did I have this recent realization? Quite simply because a lot of my own philosophy regarding photographic endeavors are echoed by the author of a blog that I have been following recently. Let me revise that a little - the conclusions the author reaches are exactly the same conclusions I have come to but his thought process and pathway to that conclusion are so vastly different than mine that I get what she found vexing in our relationship , well at least on that one point there were many many others that are irrelevant to this conversation.</p>

<p>Realize that this was not just one post of his but quite a few on quite a number of very different specific conclusions. Case in point: Here is <a href="http://www.ultrasomething.com/photography/2011/06/lobotomy-please/">a post that is mostly an explanation of the way his own internal gears grind</a> things and a loose conclusion. Depending on how your gears grind this may make a lot of sense to you or not. For me it doesn&#8217;t but it gets to the same exact end result as <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2010/07/27/photography-media-materials-and-purpose/">this post of mine</a>, or <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/07/03/photographic-philosophy/">this one</a>, or <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2010/08/29/professional-photography-state-of-the-union/">this one</a>, as well as a bunch of other loosely connected stuff I have posted here over the last few years. It&#8217;s just that the way his head works is so completely different than mine that I don&#8217;t even get his thought process - yes I understand all the words and understand/agree with his conclusions but they path he took is very muddy to me and doesn&#8217;t generate the same connections as it does to him.</p>

<p>In any case I thought a few of you may be interested in his blog - yes this is the kind of stuff I read.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay - this is going to be a quick one considering I am really annoyed and quite pissed off. <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/06/02/whats-wrong-with-this-color-management-picture/">Remember this post about monitor calibration?</a> Well, I got exactly nowhere - I put down my money, I put in the time, I have been extremely patient (not one of my strong points) and here is what I got as the last update&#8230; THREE F&#8217;ING WEEKS AGO. And yes I followed up.</p>

<p>Robert,</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t heard anything beyond what they told me before. I guess they are
working on other things. I would think Apple would be all over this seeing
as it&#8217;s their doing. They are messing with the profiles like they know
better how it should be done. Have you tried it with Lion yet? I don&#8217;t
have it yet, but it would be interesting to see if the problem changes
with the new OS. I don&#8217;t have anything more to tell you.</p>

<p>XXXXXXXXXX
Technical Support Representative</p>

<p>Name redacted to protect the innocent. I did send a response to this with a bunch of requirements for me to be a little bit more comfortable with this complete bullshit response. You gotta love the &#8220;they&#8221;, &#8220;they&#8221;, &#8220;they&#8221;. You have got t0 be kidding me right? I am at the point of almost being frustrated here. Almost, on the precipice, at the edge&#8230;</p>

<p>More to come.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. Oh forgot the punchline here - the &#8220;evidence&#8221; that this IS an Apple issue is two links to idiots complaining on an apple support forum a couple of years ago. Hmmm hope they are not waiting for those couple guys to figure this out. I really really am about to call bullshit on this. Either they can come up with an answer or withdraw their product as somehow worthwhile at all in their chosen market.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple of photo related thoughts for Friday of the holiday weekend and the unofficial end of summer. Hope all  of you out there have some fantastic plans for the long weekend. Me, I am just going to take it easy and try to get over this summertime flu that I have had for going on a week. So here is the round up of random stuff&#8230;</p>

<ul>
    <li>Love my new D7000 - a bit small for all the controls demanding your attention but not small enough for a compact. Don&#8217;t get me wrong - it makes high quality images very quickly but cannot understand why cameras this big don&#8217;t have FX sensors.It&#8217;s not HUGE but it is at least as big as an FM or FE. Be careful for what you ask for - want a button dedicated to everything? D7000&#8217;s got them but man they are small and jammed up if you are used to using something like a D3. I think there are trade offs to be made and don&#8217;t know if we have seen a perfect balance yet. It seems that we either get tons of um that defy making a camera really compact / really fiddly or we get not enough and a bunch of menu bullshit. In any case my criticism of the D7000 is minor - this is the best DX camera yet. Unless you shoot lots of frames at full blast don&#8217;t worry about the buffer size crap you hear - this thing is fast and is pretty hard to jamb you up taking images of normal stuff, in normal contexts. Honestly, if you can&#8217;t get your shot before you jamb this buffer up you need to rethink what the hell you are doing. The presets for Aperture 3 have been started - man the color is tricky to replicate in Aperture I am thinking that I will be able to either get really close on most of them and totally screw up some not to often seen colors or compromise &#8220;exactness&#8221; for a more universal overall effect. The Nikon blue renderings are a bear to get even near &#8220;correct&#8221; in Aperture 3. On a bright note - the reds are not really off like they were in some older cameras from my test shots so far.</li>
    <li>Clarification on my X100 rant from the other day. I will probably buy an X100 sooner or later. I just will not do it at the ridiculously inflated prices that we have seen. I will also not &#8220;order&#8221; one with no definitive and reasonably close delivery date. My parameters are more likely to be when they are readily available at the typical &#8220;street price&#8221; - meaning a hundred or two less than MSRP from just about anywhere.</li>
    <li>Woooohooooo we get a Fuji X10 in November - who cares. Will I get one ?- maybe. Will it totally kill the LX5? Doubt it. What will probably happen is they will sell for over the MSRP&#8217;s already inflated $600 price tag for quite a while until the technology goes rotten like all digi-cams. I do like the design and I do like that it has an OVF - what&#8217;s not to like about that. Unbelievable that only one guy out there is doing anything close to what photo people have wanted in an alternative camera with the X100. This means we get to pay WAY more than we should be paying. Me - I will wait and see - there is nothing super magical about the X10 or X100 except for that it does get a couple thing right that other companies cannot seem to understand no matter how loud the market screams. I do think if these things are selling for more than $600 when they are actually available that you have to be on crack to buy one of them vs say a NEX or D5100 or whatever.</li>
    <li>The &#8220;tweet&#8221; yesterday from Nikon asking if there were people still shooting film. Of course I answered them. Wonder what possessed them to tweet about film? Curious. Maybe they have had it with digital chaos as well?  Doubt it but still curious. The number of people that still shoot film in Japan is still unbelievable, relatively speaking. Curious?</li>
</ul>


<p>Have a great holiday.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I few days ago, way back before the hurricane, I <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/08/26/new-nikon-specific-aperture-3-product-quiz/">posted a survey</a> to determine if there were people interested in a set of Aperture 3 presets for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042X9LC4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B0042X9LC4">Nikon D7000</a> that emulated Nikon Picture Controls. Based on the results I am going to go forward and put these together. Not today though, I have a touch of some sort of summertime flu and I am miserable and not in the proper mood to approach anything that seems like it needs some sort of coherency.</p>

<p>I received the D7000 yesterday and shot maybe a dozen shots just to see if it &#8220;worked&#8221; and to ponder what I didn&#8217;t like about it. I will get around to a more compete semi-review in the coming days and weeks but for now let&#8217;s say that it&#8217;s not perfect but by far exceeds my expectations. To be blunt my biggest complaint is the body is a little too small given the control layout and my idiotically large hands. Specifically the placement of the AF-L/AE-L button causes me some concern in my normal nikon setup of separating the focus from the shutter release. I sort of jamb my thumb into my forehead when I try this - maybe it&#8217;s just the flu getting the better of me. Well see.</p>

<p>Back to the story of Aperture 3 RAW interpretation being WAY different than Nikon colors - yep, the trend continues for the D7000. The same old story with the same old colors just a wee bit different so as to make my old presets useless. Does Apple randomly figure out how to render colors for Nikon cameras? Who knows, until someone explains this to me I will have to continue to guess at how they might go about it.</p>

<p>For all you non Nikon shooters here is what us Nikon guys are talking about up close and personal for you to see what all the hub-bub is about&#8230;.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ap3.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ap3.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>See the image on the left - that is an OOC JPEG (NX2 will render the RAW file EXACTLY the same) the image on the right is the Aperture 3 RAW decode. See the difference? This is only showing a few of the colors on a color checker, the rest are whacked out as well. The good news is WB doesn&#8217;t seem to be off the way it was for older cameras. The bad news - wellllll looks like a nice healthy dose of yellow green crossover and a case of too much green in the powder blues - typical.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll get crack&#8217;in on dealing with the presets as soon a my head stops hurting and can hold the camera still for more than 5 seconds.</p>
