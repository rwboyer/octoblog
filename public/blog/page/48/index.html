I took a ride in a Zodiak the other day and we got swamped while I was carrying a D200 around my shoulder with a Nikon 12-24 AFS lens on my shoulder. I mean this was a lot of water, a whole lot all at once. Now I have had my D2H&#8217;s, my D2x&#8217;s (before they were liberated from me), and my D3 get wet and based on experience with my D2H&#8217;s never really worried about it. The D200 has seen a very short life with me and they still look like new. I bought them when my D2x&#8217;s (both of them) were stolen and that not even a year before I got the D3.Â  So they really haven&#8217;t seen much of the world - heck I think that one has under 10K exposures on it.</p>

<p>Back on point - the D200 get real wet and I was a little worried that It might have seen it&#8217;s life cut a little short. Nothing to dry it off with when we arrived on shore considering everything was wet. So with the D200 quite literally still dripping I fired off a couple of shots of the closest interesting subject. A big dead fish - I think it&#8217;s a carp?</p>

<p>Just wanted to give you the first hand report that these things are built very very well and don&#8217;t give up the ghost easily.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2002_006_05_nx.jpg"><img title="2002_006_05_nx.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.2002_006_05_nx.jpg" border="0" alt="2002_006_05_nx.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" align="left" /></a>Let me start out by saying that Ilford HP5 plus was not one of my favorite films. I would much rather shoot TX or TXP, that&#8217;s Kodak Tri-X in 35mm and medium format. The one and only one exception is HP5 plus in medium format or large format developed in one of a few different pyro developer formulations.</p>

<p>For those not familiar with pyro development it has some unique properties. It is sort of a compensating developer, meaning that it develops more in the shadows and exhausts quickly in the highlights when used in high dilutions with minimum agitation. So you can get a negative with good detail thoughout the exposure range. Negatives have a very long tonal scale. Pyro is high acutance, meaning it did not dissolve the edges of the film grain and exhibited the mackie effect to some degree (enhanced edges between areas of high contrast), sort of like an automatic unsharp mask. Last but not least the image densities were composed of both silver and dye stain. The reason I used HP5 plus with pyro was specifically for the staining characteristics that the film had relative to other films and the speed. Pyro was not really a high speed developer you could expect the films sensitivity to go down almost a stop compared with other developers.<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2002_006_05_nx_crop1.jpg"><img title="2002_006_05_nx_crop1.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.2002_006_05_nx_crop1.jpg" border="0" alt="2002_006_05_nx_crop1.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" align="right" /></a></p>

<p>The image staining was amazing in that it added to the acutance effects but masked the grain structure giving you a very smooth super sharp image effect. It also acted as a variable built in contrast mask as densities on the film when up the dye stain became stronger in proportion. The stain was yellow-green, it so happens that blue light on variable contrast black and white paper makes the contrast go up, filtering blue out makes the contrast go down. When printing a pyro stained negative on VC paper there was a unique and beautiful easy to print fantatically detailed highlights almost automatically. Pyro stained negatives also looked fantastic on graded papers and had characteristics the same as any negative even though they looked &#8220;thin&#8221; due to some of the image density being made up of dye stain. Pyro also had amazing tonal gradation, using my scanner and todays display technologies you are only going to see a tiny tiny representation of tones that they reproduce.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2002_006_11.jpg"><img title="2002_006_11.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.2002_006_11.jpg" border="0" alt="2002_006_11.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" align="left" /></a>The downside of this is scanning pyro developed negatives are a bitch because they react completely differently than they do printing on paper. I have tried a few times but have given up on making them look similar to what they look like on black and white paper. If anyone out there has experience with scanning and processing pyro developed negatives I would love for you to share the recipe with me. There is no comparison, so for educational purposes here are a few shots of HP5 plus and some random 100% crops. No sharpening, blackpoint to true dmax black, that&#8217;s it. As usual there are some film flatness issues when viewing at 100% as well as the reality of &#8220;depth of field&#8221; with medium format.<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2002_006_11_crop2.jpg"><img title="2002_006_11_crop2.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.2002_006_11_crop2.jpg" border="0" alt="2002_006_11_crop2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" align="right" /></a></p>

<p>Shot with a Hasselblad 503CW - 80mm Zeiss CF - hand held 1/60 f4 and 1/125 f2.8. Maybe I will get around to playing around with it when I can retire, I feel confident that it has something to do with treating the the color channels differently than the greyscale as a whole and then combining them so that the stain does the same thing for the scanned image as it does for printing on black and white paper. In reality I have not shot HP5 plus or printed it in at least 3 years and probably won&#8217;t unless I get a hankering to fire up a darkroom again someday. I occasionally develop some film but have not been set up for prints in about 3 years.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2002_006_07_crop1.jpg"><img title="2002_006_07_crop1.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.2002_006_07_crop1.jpg" border="0" alt="2002_006_07_crop1.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" align="left" /></a>I guess if you can take in some of the words that I sputtered on about, convert that into some sort of visual filter, and use your imagination you may be able to get an idea of the beauty of this film and developer combination. Check out the detail in the sheer fabric that is picked up at 100%. Realize how small that is in both reality and in the full image, holy crap. Even with this crappy scan a typical sharpening would make this pop. You can sort of get a feeling for the delicate way that it handles highlights looking at this crop from the face.</p>

<p>I still have a couple of bricks of this stuff in the downstairs fridge. If you ever get a hankering to play with pyro I would absolutely recommed HP5 plus as the film to do it with. Start with very minimal agitations, like one inverstion ever minute. If the film hasn&#8217;t changed much since that last time I shot it you will probably see a real ISO of around 200 to 250. Do not shoot this at 400 no matter what the claim of the purveyer of the development formula. I personally have never seen a pyro developer get 400 out of HP5 plus. I guess if you were to really use long development times that would make it unsuitable for printing on graded papers you might get 400 as measured in the midtones but never the shadows at Zone III.</p>

<p>If your lacking inspiration lately and find your digital photographic life a little too <a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2002_006_07.jpg"><img title="2002_006_07.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.2002_006_07.jpg" border="0" alt="2002_006_07.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" align="right" /></a>complicated grab yourself a spot meter some medim format film and one of a dozen fabulous 6x6, 6x4,5, or 6x7 systems that can be had for a song on eBay. Find a willing subject and a window and enjoy. Don&#8217;t be afraid of a normal lens - this was all shot on with a &#8220;normal&#8221; 80mm and I had a gaggle of other lenses to choose from. It doesn&#8217;t get much better than this. I guarantee you will have a blast, probably create some really nice images, and learn a whole lot that will carry forward to your digital life. Maybe even simplifying it in the process.</p>

<p>Ps I am serious about hearing from people that have got the pyro negative scanning thing in the bag. I have about 10,000 pyro negatives that I cannot bear to output digitally because my feeble attempts don&#8217;t even come close to my traditional silver prints and I am not one of those people that pooh-pooh digital capture or output.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/proactive_metadata.jpg"><img title="proactive_metadata.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.proactive_metadata.jpg" border="0" alt="proactive_metadata.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="94" align="left" /></a>If you have been diligently adding your keywords, captions, location information, and other metadata using Aperture (or Lightroom, or Photo Mechanic, or any other photo browser for that matter) as you know it can be very useful for finding images fast. Even if you haven&#8217;t been so disciplined adding your own metadata there are still some interesting and fun things you can do with Aperture on a crappy Saturday afternoon if you are not inspired to go out and shoot.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s assume that you have not been that diligent with the keywords. There is plenty you can do and learn from the EXIF assuming you are shooting a digital camera. I love not having to take notes anymore. Not only that but all of that is in a database. Here are a couple of ideas that I use every once in a while to explore my photographs, my habits, and preferences over the long term using EXIF focal length and lens model data.</p>

<p>I love to search my entire library using the EXIF focal length field. Actually I use the 35mm equivalent field since I shoot with two different sized sensors. Typically I will use the range option in the search HUD so that I pickup all of the shots that are close to what I am looking for. As a for instance using a &#8220;in the range&#8221; search between 17 and 21 on the &#8220;Focal length (35mm) EXIF field will give me all of the ultra-wide shots used on both my DX and FX bodies as well as all of the lenses that I happen to have used no matter whether they were fixed or zoom.</p>

<p>I find it incredibly instructional to understand my shooting habits and preferences for a lot of different reasons, especially now that I use a lot of zooms in day to day work. I can easily tell you what lenses I use constantly, but I would have a hard time telling you what focal length regions they happen to be set at. You can use this in a lot of different ways in combination with the other EXIF like shutter speeds, apertures, as well as subjective evaluations of the images shot. For instance, I wrote about rethinking Nikon&#8217;s new 50mm AFS f1.4 lens a while back. One of the things that spurred me to do this was searching my library for &#8220;Focal length (35) in the range 40 to 60 and the range 70 to 85. What I found was astonishing.</p>

<p>If you would have asked me if I use a &#8220;normal&#8221; focal length I would have said that I do but I found that on both my DX and FX bodies I use it way more than I thought I did and an unusually large percentage of my higher rated shots happen at that focal lenth. Almost an equal number of images shows up between 70 and 85 on both DX and FX formats. What&#8217;s more is a quick look at Aperture&#8217;s shows me at F2.8 a lot on lenses that happen to have and F2.8 maximum aperture. As I evaluated the images shot at F2.8 it became appearent to me that the choise of that aperture was not only due to shooting conditions but an equal number of times for aesthetic reasons.</p>

<p>Wow, I have an old AF 50 F1.4 but I wasn&#8217;t using it on either FX or DX - after careful thought and consideration the obvious answer was because it was more flexible to not have to change out lenses. Looking at all of the situations I could definitely see that that was true in some of them but more often than I would have guessed that focal length at normal on FX or short tele on DX would have been great for the entire shooting session. The real reason I never put the old 50 on any of my current bodies was that it was not AFS making shifting between auto and manual focus a pain, making auto focus slow, and having a horrible touchy iffy feel to manual focus. I ordered an <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/585343-GREY/Nikon_2180_AF_S_Nikkor_50mm_f_1_4G.html/BI/4674/KBID/5184">AFS 50 F1.4</a> that week. I imagine when I do a search down the road that lens will see an amazing amount of use on both FX and DX bodies.</p>

<p>If you happen to go the other way - say slightly wide to normal the new AFS 35 may be a better decision. In any case learning preferences, actual habits, aesthetics, etc by using searches on your image library is a great way to do learn things about your photography and guide both purchasing decisions and behavior. The reason I will probably not go with <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/585343-GREY/Nikon_2180_AF_S_Nikkor_50mm_f_1_4G.html/BI/4674/KBID/5184">the AFS 35</a> myself is because I shoot FX and DX, the 35 is DX only. After thinking about that for a bit and the number of &#8220;normal&#8221; focal length images shot on DX that were for low light situations I decided that I will probably be shooting those on FX going forward and the 50 was the better decision for me. If I shot a D200 or D300 or any DX body exclusively I would by the 35 AFS in a heartbeat.</p>

<p>From a behavior stand point I can also show you what lenses and focal lengths you do not use much. This could be due to subject matter, due to taste, or due to habit and a weakness of vision at a particular focal length. For those focal lengths I like to assign myself mini-projects to shoot at that focal length (or range) for an extended period of time without resorting to ways that I happen to &#8220;see&#8221; a subject. I find that doing this is a great learning and growth experience. I rarely find that it is the subject matter that is the issue. More often than not is sort of &#8220;writer&#8217;s block&#8221; and lack of ability to visualize a subject through at a particular perspective.</p>

<p>I call this using your metadata proactively, prior to Aperture, Lightroom, Photo Mechanic, iView, etc. I used metadata, or notes, whatever you want to call it much more reactively when questioned about details of a particular image - I would look it up. Using your metadata proactively as a learning or a creativity tool or just to weigh future purchases focuses more on overall shooting habits and behavior than it does details about a single image. In other words looking at all of the data first and images that have that data in common vs. looking at the image and then looking at the data behind it.</p>

<p>If anyone found this remotely useful I would be happy to let you know some of the wacky things I do to generate ideas with keywords. Just post a comment and let me know.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/2001_005_01g.jpg"><img title="2001_005_01g.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/.thumbs/.2001_005_01g.jpg" border="0" alt="2001_005_01g.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" align="left" /></a>I have had some interesting conversations generated by a post with some ramblings about camera noise, film, and TMAX 3200P. Just for fun I thought I would post a scan and some comments regarding real honest to goodness film along with some short thoughts on it&#8217;s characteristics and how I use or have used it in the past.</p>

<p>Just for fun, nostalgia for some, and curiosity for others. Personally I shoot 90% digital and 10% film. I am glad that I had the opportunity to shoot, process, and print so much of the stuff while I was growing up, learning photography, and in professional practice. I still think there are merits to using the stuff and maybe even some magical properties. Well not magical but pretty cool and sometimes difficult to duplicate. Most of the film I shoot now a days is 6x6 with a roll of 35mm here and there to exercise my Leica equipment should I ever decide to use it again.</p>

<p>On with the show. Feel free to comment or question. Today&#8217;s subject is not quite the polar opposite of TMAX 32ooP but pretty close - Agfa APX 100 shot in 6x6. The portrait at the top is a film scan at 4000 DPI of APX 100 developed N in Agfa Rodinal. A favorite combination of mine in medium format with a really really great Zeiss lens.</p>

<p>For the purposes of demonstration I am only scanning negatives that I happen to have prints made myself laying around and have done my best to show the characteristics of the film itself via a calibrated Nikon 8000ED film scanner. What does that mean? I have resisted temtation to reproduce the print on the screen. The only adjustments made for this series - including the TMAX 3200P in post are a black point adjustment to make the film edges true black (sort of like printing to true DMAX on silver geletin paper) that&#8217;s it. No sharpening, no curves, no paper tones, nothing. This leaves a lot to be desired because it does not give a sensation or imitation of the final print at all. The grey is actually neutral, there is a lot of sharpness lost in the scanning process, and there are not even close to the number of tones, especially with an 8bit 256 total tonal value image.</p>

<p>That being said a a scan of a 6x6 negative at 4000 DPI is a bit like an 80 mega-pixel image. Some films as you will see, that is plenty or even too much as there is nothing more to give up, like the TMZ image. With this one 4000 DPI may not be good enough to get everything out of the negative but plenty big to make huge prints.</p>

<p>Here are a couple of 100% views to give you an idea of what is going on with APX 100 developed in Rodinal. I loved this combination because it had a wonderful sparkle, bite, and was so sharp it hurt with great mid-tone contrast. Zone 6 and 7 (upper mids to highlights are where all the magic happened with this film)</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/2001_005_01___Version_2.jpg"></a><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/2001_005_01___Version_2g.jpg"><img title="2001_005_01___Version_2g.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/.thumbs/.2001_005_01___Version_2g.jpg" border="0" alt="2001_005_01___Version_2g.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>

<p>Note even in this crop the idiotically shallow depth of field when shooting 6x6 with a short telephoto lens. This happened to be between f5.6 and f8 on a Zeiss 150 CFi. This one should give you a better feeling for the grain structure and characteristics. because it includes some of the background that is out of focus and lacks detail.</p>

<p>Hey what&#8217;s going on here? it&#8217;s not as sharp as the last spot? Actually it is on the negative but the film was probably not completely absolutely flat in the scanner. This is a bitch to deal with and one of the reasons all the commercial stuff I have ever shot get&#8217;s scanned by scanning dudes and not me. It&#8217;s flat enough to see what the grain looks like so use your imagination. The other thing that is going on is the DOF falls off by the back of the eyebrow on the negative. Not a huge deal in a realistically sized print or even a giant one at some reasonable viewing distance. There is no such thing as depth of field - there are just degrees of out of focus that are deemed to be &#8220;sharp enough&#8221; for a given medium not to notice by humans. This does not include pixel peeping at 100% - without fail you will find that areas that are supposed to fall into the depth of field look to varying degrees of out of focus at 100% with any sensor DX sized and 4 mega-pixels or larger.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoyed this little trip down memory lane, if you are thinking about trying out some film and want to see it here, just ask, If I have it I will be glad to share.</p>

<p>Update -</p>

<p>Just wanted to add that Agfa APX 100 is sadly no longer available but I have tried a replacement that has similar characteristics. It is called <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/576138-REG/Rollei_81210011_Retro_100_120_Black.html/BI/4674/KBID/5184">Rollei Retro 100</a> you can get it at B+H unbelievable cheap. I have not tried any of the other Rollei film products that have been introduced in the last couple of years. Based on the price and quality I will probably try them as soon as I have enough time to learn a new film. I am especially wanting to try R3 hoping it will be similar to Kodak XX, Super X or old Tri-X. If anyone has tried these I would love to know what you thought.</p>

I thought I would post it here hoping it may be helpful to a few readers as well as saving my time from having to re-re-re-rewrite it over and over again.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you have a project with a bunch of images that you need to crop to a specific aspect ratio. There is a really fast and easy way to do this without screwing up your organization or marring your pristine full-frame versions. Assuming you have stacked, rated, keyworded and adjusted all of the images and all you need are 8x10 crops to send to Walmart or something, here is what you do.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Make sure all of your stacks are closed in the view that you are going to select the images from. You can do this with option-;</li>
    <li>Select all of the images that need the crop.</li>
    <li>Create a new album from the selection by either right clicking one of the images or using command-L, you should now have an album with all of the selected images. I am calling mine 8x10.</li>
    <li>Looking at the newly created album all of the stacks should still be closed,Â  if not close them and select all of the images in the album. You can do this with Command-A</li>
    <li>Now create duplicate versions of all of the images using option-V. Because you happen to be looking at an album when creating those duplicates they all become &#8220;album picks&#8221; for this album, meaning that they show up at the top when the stack is closed. Close all the stacks again so that you can only see the duplicates.</li>
    <li>Select just the first image in the album and then click on the crop tool. For our purposes I am going to use an aspect ratio of 8x10. Now apply the crop to the first image by dragging and hitting enter.</li>
    <li>Click on the lift tool to lift all of the adjustments and metadata. Un-check all of the items except adjustments and open the adjustments so that you can see them. Using the delete key, delete everything but the crop and make sure the mode is on &#8220;add&#8221;<a onclick="ps_imagemanager_popup(this.href,'screen_capture_1.jpg','1920','1200');return false" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/screen_capture_1.jpg" onfocus="this.blur()"><img title="screen_capture_1.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/.thumbs/.screen_capture_1.jpg" border="0" alt="screen_capture_1.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="94" /></a></li>
    <li>Reverse the selection by using command-R</li>
    <li>Choose &#8220;stamp selected images&#8221;. You just applied your crop to all of the other images. Great, close the lift and stamp HUD, now here comes the really great part.</li>
    <li>Select the first image only and choose the crop tool again. Do not hit enter, just use the arrow keys to &#8220;arrow through&#8221; all of your images adjusting the crop for each of the images with the mouse. No fuss, no muss. While the crop tool is active you can see and adjust the crop frame for each image without a lot of wasted motion. You do not need to hit enter for each one, if you do it will basically close the crop HUD and put you back at the arrow tool.</li>
</ol>


<p><a onclick="ps_imagemanager_popup(this.href,'screen_capture_2.jpg','1920','1200');return false" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/screen_capture_2.jpg" onfocus="this.blur()"><img title="screen_capture_2.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/.thumbs/.screen_capture_2.jpg" border="0" alt="screen_capture_2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="94" /></a></p>

<p>This sounds like a lot of steps but it&#8217;s really not. I happened to mention a lot of keyboard shortcuts that help really speed things up once you know them but even with using the menus to do everything I just explained it takes under a minute to apply this to a few dozen images and you stay organized to boot. The technique of duplicating and adjusting versions in the context of new albums having them automatically become &#8220;album picks&#8221; and showing up at the top of the stack in that album is essential to an efficient organized work-flow in Aperture. Albums and versions are practically free from a storage and resource standpoint. No need to mess about inside stacks after creating them and picking the original &#8220;stack pick&#8221; way back at the beginning of your work-flow. I never ever ever create a new version that is not somehow the &#8220;album pick&#8221; of an album somewhere.</p>

<p>Just to drive this home lets make all of these custom crops black and white.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Command-A select all.</li>
    <li>Command-L New album from selection.</li>
    <li>Type in the new name &#8220;Black and White&#8221;</li>
    <li>Control-M add monochrome mixer adjustment. Tweak settings</li>
    <li>Shift-Command-C lift</li>
    <li>Delete everything but the monochrome mixer</li>
    <li>Command-R reverse selection</li>
    <li>Stamp selected images</li>
</ol>


<p>Ten seconds flat for a new album with new black and white &#8220;album picks&#8221;.</p>

<p><a onclick="ps_imagemanager_popup(this.href,'screen_capture_3.jpg','1920','1200');return false" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/screen_capture_3.jpg" onfocus="this.blur()"><img title="screen_capture_3.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/.thumbs/.screen_capture_3.jpg" border="0" alt="screen_capture_3.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="94" /></a></p>

I was catching up on my podcasts the other day and one of my favoites asked to do him a favor by trying to spread the word about his little corner of the podcast world. Now that was like three episodes ago but hey better late than never.</p>

<p>Out of all the ridiculous repetitive info-mercial crap out there one of the shining beacons of hope is <a href="http://thecandidframe.blogspot.com/">The Candid Frame</a>. As I mentioned before, the gentleman that runs the show is a fantastic interviewer that really gets a lot out of his guests and his guests are the rockstars and who&#8217;s who of photography over the last few decades.</p>

<p>Do yourself a favor and check it out. If you are really into photography or even if you are not they are interesting, entertaining, and you will learn a whole lot more than listening to the 7413th person prattle on about shutter speeds, how to make your photos look like cartoons in Photoshop, or HDR.</p>

<p>I promise.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/DSC_0081.jpg"><img title="DSC_0081.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/.thumbs/.DSC_0081.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_0081.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="left" /></a>I occasionally do workshops, some of them on lighting. All of the rage these days are workshops, websites, and photographers extolling the virtues and showing people what you can do with small strobes. In otherwords &#8220;hot shoe&#8221; strobes. I thought that I would share a couple of thoughts on the subject of small strobes.</p>

<p>A couple of disclaimers first. Yes I use small strobes on occasion, I always have. I happen to use Nikon SB800&#8217;s and SB900&#8217;s (two each) and I think that the Nikon CLS is superior to other camera makers systems in concept and sometimes in practice under very specific circumstances. The reality is it falls short in most practical situations and therefore is equivalent to other systems for the vast majority of reality. Personally I really don&#8217;t get the popularity of small strobe sites, workshops, books, etc, etc over the last couple of years. This stuff has been done with &#8220;portable&#8221; flash units for decades, there is no magical digital newness that makes this easier or different than it ever was. Here are some of my thoughts.</p>

<p>Small flashes are almost useless without external battery packs, the recycle times, battery costs, and battery life times are crap. That brings up another point, small flash units are not cheap. The units themselves are hundreds of dollars, external battery packs are expensive, and you still need stands, modifiers, etc. The wireless systems are crap, they are line of site IR nonsense that I find highly unworkable in real world situations. The last thing that I want to worry about and fool with is whether my lights are going to fire. If you really want to be sure they will fire and you want placement flexibility you are probably going to want radio slaves (aka pocket wizards) also not cheap. As soon as you add these bye bye TTL metering and controlling output/ratios from the camera. Yea I know about the company that is converting the IR to radio and preserving the TTL but why? It is a kludge of a solution, adds a bunch more stuff to fail and debug and TTL really is not that useful for multi-light setups in the first place. It&#8217;s okay for quick and dirty balanced fill flash when you are on the run, or for snapshot work, or for photojournalists (although really good PJs have always used off camera portable flash and most of them had no use for TTL auto balance anything, check out 90&#8217;s National Geographic Images). The only thing it is really good for is light background dark foreground quick and dirty exposure &#8220;balancing&#8221;.</p>

<p>Let me break it down for you. Let&#8217;s say you have the time to set up a couple of lights, two for arguments sake, and to position them, and to push all the little buttons to put the lights in the right &#8220;groups&#8221; in Nikon CLS speak, and then set all of you camera menus correctly. I really don&#8217;t care what the situation is. Indoors, outdoors, whatever. Let&#8217;s even say you want to balance the strobes with ambient. Okay you are all set to go, none of that &#8220;happened&#8221; spur of the moment, split second. Now what&#8217;s going to happen next? Are you going to put your subject in there or wait until they show up and then take one shot and that&#8217;s it hoping every thing will turn out? If you do you may end up with a usable exposure given that the CLS system is pretty good but hey I could probably do the same thing by guessing at flast positions and ouput levels and the exposure setting for the camera without metering anything on manual everything. Maybe you can&#8217;t but that&#8217;s just because it maybe the first couple of times that you have done something like that. The reality is if you are setting up lights you are going to test it and make adjustments to positioning, power output, camera exposure, etc. Okay we can either do that via +/- TTL settings for the lights in the camera menus and see what happens because it is not even close to predictable, well I guess it is predictable and quite amazing that it works as well as it does but there are a million variables that will cause it to react differently shot to shot from your settings. OR&#8230; you can make the exact same adjustments not using TTL anything and have the lights do exactly what they did shot to shot with NO variation from what you told them to do while making adjustments to your setup. Where is the time savings? What is the upside? I really don&#8217;t get it. Don&#8217;t get me wrong I do use TTL flash, just not for anything remotely complicated or where I need to test and want shot to shot repeatability. Make&#8217;s no sense. I am sure that there are occasions where things are changing so fast that you just need to get the shot but again wouldn&#8217;t your lighting angles and positioning be changing to?</p>

<p>Returning back to power for a second. As soon as you start to diffuse the light with boxes, light panels, silks whatever you are going to lose a bunch of light coming out of the strobe. With the little puny guys this is no big deal if you are inside and shooting with a camera that you can bump the ISO up a bit but it&#8217;s a whole different story outdoors. You need more stands, worse more flash units in a large number of circumstances. Like a lot more flash units. Don&#8217;t misunderstand there is some cool stuff you can do, especially with the super duper strange flash mode on CLS that fires the flash for the entire shutter movement so that it can sync up to 1/8000 now you can under expose daylight by a couple of stops and make stuff that is really cool like the shots you see Joe McNally doing out in the desert in broad daylight. Oooops just one thing the power really goes down the tubes in that auto-fp mode so all you need to do is pickup like 13 SB900 units. Very economical but hey the DIY crowd eats this stuff up while discussing how to make a beauty dish out of a salad bowl for $1.23 (see why I don&#8217;t get the craze).</p>

<p>So what are these little guys good for? For me, they are good for traveling really light and serving double duty - quick and dirty stuff as well as more carefully controlled stuff while traveling. You still are going to need some stands and modifiers and and and&#8230; but at least the stands can be crappier stands (smaller, lighter) and so will your lights but don&#8217;t kid yourself, you will not save a lot of money and everything get magically easier by going with a couple hot shoe flashes rather than a bigger more powerful system. If you don&#8217;t travel much for me it&#8217;s a no brainer. I do mean travel, as in on a plane, not load up the car and go shoot somewhere.</p>

<p>If I were looking to do serious work on a realistic budget I would probably opt for some of the more traditional systems out there, there are a lot of options that balance power, portablity, cost, versatility far better than hot shoe units. I guess my point is don&#8217;t get sucked in to some fantasy that a bunch of the latest $500 shoe mount flashes that happen to do wireless and TTL are going to be some sort of magic potion that will make great images automatically or even do anything a whole lot faster and more &#8220;automatically&#8221; than a more traditional/versatile system.</p>

<p>If portability and ability to run without wall outlets are a concern some of the traditional strobe manufacturers have introduced some fantastic solutions over the last few years that integrate very will with their existing systems.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. For anyone interested the shot at the top was done with one SB800 in broad daylight/high noonish. Here it is with the flash in the same exact position everything set to TTL auto auto auto auto auto balance i-CameraMagical CLS. I was just goofing around on Memorial day having a conversation with and e-buddy and took a couple of example shots to explain something to him and this happens to be about 3 steps from my computer. I actually use the same technique with people in the scene when I have to shoot on ugly crappy days at ugly crappy times.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/2001_031_01.jpg"><img title="2001_031_01.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/.thumbs/.2001_031_01.jpg" border="0" alt="2001_031_01.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="101" height="150" align="left" /></a>Had a couple of interesting email conversations about my current existensial/camera acquisition crisis that meandered into a discussion regarding image noise and some comments I made a few posts ago on why image noise is not a huge priority for me. I have never owned a specialized noise reduction tool and to be blunt I can probably count the number of times that I have used noise reduction on an image. I am not at all disparaging those that use or depend on it. I just haven&#8217;t experienced making or viewing a lot of images where &#8220;noise&#8221; was the make or break factor. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I would never put myself into a situation where noise/grain was completely inappropriate for a given subject or project. I wouldn&#8217;t choose a camera or a film a format (ISO setting) that would compromise what I was trying to do and rarely find myself needing super high ISO/film speeds in situations where I really really care about image noise.</p>

<p>Maybe I am a bit old fashioned but even my very first digital body looked fantastic at ISO 200 compared to film of a similar format at similar enlargement sizes. At ISO 1600 it sort of looked like 800 speed film at similar format and enlargement sizes. I was much more interested in how well it differentiated tones and color rendition and handling. Maybe that is why I never really chimed in and ranted and raved about noise. Maybe that is why I really liked the Nikon D2H.</p>

<p>Anyway for those that have not shot film and never care to I thought I would give you just a little bit of perspective. The shot at the top of the post was on 35mm TMZ, TMAX 3200P for you non-film people, shot at ISO 1600 developed in XTOL 1+2. The scan has no image sharpening and a real quick levels adjustment to get it to display like a print on grade 2 Ilford Gallarie (the only print of that neg I have laying around). The scan was 4000 dpi on a Nikon 8000ED scanner. As a note real black and white film is not the best stuff to scan in the world and you are looking at a completely neutral 8bit JPG, meaning you can only see 256 tones in this image. That doesn&#8217;t even come close to the tonality of a real print of this negative. What you can see is the image noise.</p>

<p>Here is a 100% crop to give you a better idea of what 35mm ISO 1600 film looks like:</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/2001_031_01_crop1.jpg"><img title="2001_031_01_crop1.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/.thumbs/.2001_031_01_crop1.jpg" border="0" alt="2001_031_01_crop1.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>

<p>Here is another one to give you a better sense of it:</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/2001_031_01_crop2.jpg"><img title="2001_031_01_crop2.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/.thumbs/.2001_031_01_crop2.jpg" border="0" alt="2001_031_01_crop2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>

<p>Does the &#8220;noise&#8221; have anything to do with wheather this is a good image?</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. Yes I did actually shoot a couple of weddings in my day.</p>

I cannot begin to cover all of them at the moment but I had so many regarding my number one issue, NEF RAW processing, that I thought I would share a couple thoughts.</p>

<p>First I had about the same number of emails that agreed with my dissatisfaction as asked me what I was so upset about. Here is the bottom line for all of those out there asking what I am so upset about Aperture&#8217;s continued NEF horribleness. One word - COLOR. A picture is worth a thousand words so here are a couple.</p>

<p>The image at the top of the post is every single relevant in camera image control of a so-so camera compared to the latest greatest, the D200, set at normal, normal, normal, etc. So this means that Capture NX2 does nothing to soup up the image - this as &#8220;normal&#8221; as it gets using the default NX2 RAW conversion. Other shooting details Auto WB, ISO 1600, first thing that caught my eye hand held not even steady about 5 minutes ago.</p>

<p>Here is the default Aperture RAW conversion</p>

<p><img title="DSC_0102__1_.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/DSC_0102__1_.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_0102__1_.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="700" height="469" /></p>

<p>Here is the NX2 conversion with one thing changed - a Nikon Picture Control set to vivid.</p>

<p><img title="DSC_0102.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/DSC_0102.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_0102.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="700" height="468" /></p>

<p>If you are asking what&#8217;s the big deal? Download the images and look at them side by side. Most of you can probably see the huge difference in the thumbnails. Which one is the crappiest? The Aperture default conversion. Why is it a big deal that it is crappy? My most succinct answers are as follows:</p>

<ol>
    <li>A lot of this is caused by a huge difference in WB and there is no easy way to make a universal correction to any one camera let alone a universal correction across a couple of different NEF files produced by different camera models. Every different lighting temperature takes a completely different set of adjustments. Even if there was a good way to set this as an incremental set of change the WB by X amount for a single NEF file type it wouldn&#8217;t matter because Aperture seems to &#8220;guess&#8221; differently on every image seeming to ignore WB settings. This really sucks for both Auto WB people that shoot in lighting that is all over the map as well as preset WB people that use a specific camera setting under multiple different controlled lighting conditions. I swear figuring this out is way worse to get good predictable color than when I shot film and had to figure out filtration/lights/gels for a new film. Or it&#8217;s about the same if you want consistent results without bit twiddling to get there.</li>
    <li>Even with WB set dead neutral on the same target and the same lighting color is way way way off in ways so strange that it is extremely difficult to correct with one set of preset color adjustments - no it isn&#8217;t just different - it is wrong. Tie this in with the WB situation and you have to fool around a lot to get good color. Not brighter, not more saturated, good color. Apple - get the freaking WB and color right for NEF&#8217;s or I am definitely outta here.</li>
</ol>


<p>The other thing that I continue to whine about is picture control. Now I cannot take full advantage of Nikon picture control without using NX2 but I can get real close using ACR in it&#8217;s present incarnation. I think I have explained this before but I will do it again briefly for those that are not familiar. Nikon picture control is way more than a couple of presets. They are profiles that are applied either in-camera to the JPG&#8217;s and are recored as metadata in the RAW file that gets interpreted and applied in NX2 but it does not end there. Picture control settings match across bodies. Yep if I take my old D2 series cameras and apply a Nikon picture control to the NEF files the color and contrast are virtually identical to my brand new D3 with the same picture control. Great concept. If you don&#8217;t care for the built in picture controls you can make your own, upload them to newer cameras if you want (you don&#8217;t have to if you shoot RAW) and voila your own color/tone curves that are completely reproducable across all NEF&#8217;s, very very cool. If you have a newer camera they will even be applied in-camera to the JPG&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Adobe thought this was cool to so now ACR has camera profiles. You can&#8217;t upload them to the camera but they work in concept the same way. To prove that they work they give you the exact same &#8220;camera profiles&#8221; for NEF files that Nikon supplies as &#8220;picture controls&#8221; and they match unbelievably closely. Yep they match across Nikon camera bodies as well. Theoretically you could actually create a custom camera profile across different brands as well. It is way more work than creating a picture control because you have to do all the work but it is possible.</p>

<p>If Adobe can do it then so can Apple or at least match the freaking WB and default color response. As a Nikon shooter this is getting really really old. Maybe some more regarding some other conversations that were generated by that post as well as my current existential crisis tomorrow.</p>

<p>Any questions?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/DSC_9596_standard.jpg"><img title="DSC_9596_standard.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/.thumbs/.DSC_9596_standard.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_9596_standard.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="101" align="left" /></a>I have resisted writing a post like this for quite a while. Mostly due to the fact that there are plenty of sources of complaints, wishlists, and prognostications about Aperture&#8217;s features, what it needs, and how it should or shouldn&#8217;t work. Somehow I feel like the sole Aperture cheerleader out there and am feeling a little lonely. Today I am going to vent a bit about what I feel Aperture needs. I am not going to do this from a how can we sell more copies perspective or repeat a lot of what I hear from people that appear to have used Aperture for about 3 hours and really do not grasp the software or for that matter repeat gripes about how difficult Aperture is to force into a backwards way of doing things. I am going to list what is going to cause me to replace Aperture as my primary workflow tool as someone that uses the product day in and day out. Caution! I may actually use some bad words from here on out.</p>

<ol>
    <li>I either want Adobe&#8217;s RAW procesng engine and camera profiles or I want Apple to do something at least as good. I am a Nikon shooter and the state of afairs in NEF processing in Aperture sucks. Screw debating about the merits of this and that, screw pixel peeping. I like the color I get from NX2 and now from ACR. I like knowing how my WB is going to interact with color. Apple&#8217;s RAW engine has gone nowhere in most respects with NEF&#8217;s. I look at a new camera body the way I used to look at a new film back in the day - A giant pain in the ass. Apple your NEF processing blows and I am sick and tired of having to screw around to get my color the way I want it. See the image at the top of the post - that is NX2 picture control standard - here is the Aperture default.<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/DSC_9596___Version_2.jpg"><img title="DSC_9596___Version_2.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/.thumbs/.DSC_9596___Version_2.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_9596___Version_2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="101" align="right" /></a></li>
    <li>Aperture&#8217;s keyword and metadata tools were freaking great - back in version 1.0 too bad they have gone absolutely nowhere. For god&#8217;s sake keyword hierarchies are great. To freaking bad Apple can find their way clear to find a freaking way to freaking put a freaking G.D. check-freaking-box to embed all of the freaking hierarchy in exported images. This sucks. Screw this I am freaking tired of using my piece of freaking crap script to do this in a backwards dumb ass way. While you are adding the check box think about doing something innovative too. Like maybe keyword synonyms, maybe one upping Lightroom and allowing you to embed not only the primary hierarchy but all of the synonyms for all of the keywords too. Now this would be a huge win for people that actually shoot stock. Heck it&#8217;s great as a search tool too. WTF Oh and give some real support for XMP - it is amazing how easy it is to get out of Aperture why not make it easy to get XMP in and not just once but some sort of sync mechanizm.</li>
    <li>Printing is and has been hopelessly broken since V2. Let&#8217;s add to the fact that the printing features are not even useful for anything but a print either. We are talking about Aperture prints going wonky without rhym or reason. Yes I know what I am doing. Yes I have a backwards ass way of fixing it by trashing this and that and then waving some chicken bones to get printing to work again but again WTF? Let&#8217;s assume that half of the printing issues that come up on the support forum are idiots that have no idea what they are doing. Okay that&#8217;s 6,349 per day divided by 2 for the idiot factor and we&#8217;ll round down for the anecdoteal factor we&#8217;re left with 3000 issues per day. This is broken. Hey while you are at it take a look at Lightroom printing.</li>
    <li>Please let me select and manipulate more than one freaking project at a time in the inspector, please, please. I promise if I accidently delete more than one instead of accidently deleting only one I will not call support and blame you guys.</li>
    <li>Give the book tool some love. I was a great start with V1 but has also gone nowhere. It still has potential and may be the only reason I still use Aperture but&#8230;</li>
    <li>Gimme some local adjustmens like Lightroom only way better.</li>
    <li>Gimme a really good surprise like Photomagico integrated only better. Like a way way better slideshow and a way not only to show them but output them to a bunch of different places really easy. Sort of a book tool for slideshows, you know Photomagico integrated only better.</li>
    <li>Either get rid of the web tools or make them do something useful and really cool. Not like iWeb, iWeb sucks. Gimme some web tools that really really help somebody that does photography and web stuff more than like twice a year.</li>
    <li>Not that I am a big HDR fan but you would surprise everyone if you gave the world a reall kickass state of the art and easy to use HDR toolset integrated with Aperture and maybe some stitching stuff to go along with it.</li>
    <li>Although not really on my make or break list I will through in a bone for some additional file management and syncronization features. Just make sure that if you must include some idiotic mobile me sync crap that you help the rest of us that deal with a laptop and a main library to speed things up with easy but sophisticated and controlable features that are not broken when mobile me is broken.</li>
</ol>


<p>There it is that is my list, anythiing surprising to all of you folks out there? Anything that I missed that you guys thing absolutely must be in the next Aperture? If so let me know what you think. I swear if Apple goes and puts some dumb ass mobile me shit and faces in there or some asinine mapping crap that does me no good on a daily basis (and most other people that actually use this stuff more than the 5 minute in store demo) I will be done with the product, I swear I will. I will be done if there is just some freaking window dressing and no meat that helps me spend less time and produce better quality.</p>

<p>Over and out.</p>
