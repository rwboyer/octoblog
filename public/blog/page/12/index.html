  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have tens of thousands of slides that I shot. Virtually none are scanned.Every once in a while I will pop open a box of &#8220;rejects&#8221;. I know they are &#8220;rejects&#8221; because they are in a box and not filed. Of course the box and each slide has metadata in the form of a date stamp. The really cool thing about looking at some of these is finding images that I rejected based on things that at the time seemed important but I never threw film away NEVER.</p>

<p>Considering most of the film I ever shot I declared rejects the vast majority of my images have not ever seen the light of day. Every time I venture into the vast pile of rejects it&#8217;s an adventure - truly amazing to me. You can do this with digital of course but it doesn&#8217;t seem to feel the same. The other thing that&#8217;s not the same is that even though I keep most of the digital I shoot, I don&#8217;t keep all of it - I trash it. Never on camera but I do blow a lot of unwanted frames away. I will never know if that was a mistake now. Just another stupid reason I still like to shoot film.</p>

<p>Here is one of the Kodachrome slides I discovered today - there is a boat load in the same box that are fantastic and all of the same theme. My daughters playing with bubbles in harh horrible midday light. Forgive the crappy uncalibrated scan I will probably scan some of these for real as soon as I have a chance to calibrate my scanner which I have not done in a very long time as I mostly shoot black and white. Oh, one other thing - shot these on an F3 in the mid-90&#8217;s</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Part of the Aperture 3 SuperSimpleStuff™ series.
Every once in a while I look at my site statistics and usually scratch my head in wonder regarding posts that get traffic all of a sudden that I haven&#8217;t seen in a year or more. I usually read them to see how off I was, how my thinking has changed, how many typos there are, etc. One consistent fact is that I am not a good proof-reader. Occasionally I find something that I forgot about entirely that still has some degree of relevance. If it makes sense I even bring it up again like now.</p>

<p>Yesterday <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2008/10/28/aperture-2-quick-tip-workflow-recipie/">this post on workflow seemed to be pretty popular</a> - yes there are minute differences between this and Aperture 3 but nothing earth shattering. Mostly details regarding how the import window works. There are a couple of things in here that I want to bring up a level and talk about when using Aperture 3 as your primary workflow tool. All of these general guidelines are true no matter what you use to organize your process with an important singular theme. Consistency is of critical importance when it comes to work-flow.</p>

<p>A lot of work-flow advice covers things very broadly like import fix backup. Here are a couple of things that are Aperture 3 specific that I find very useful.</p>

<ul>
    <li>If you use stacks to contain multiple versions ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS make a new album that will have the album picks be those new alternate versions name the album for it&#8217;s purpose. Black and White, Cropped, Sharpened, Whatever. If you create new stacked versions willy nilly I will assure you that your stacks will be more of a hinderance than a help.</li>
    <li>Metadata first. Do this early and do it for all your images. I am serious here. This is strongly associated with the chaos that can happen if you create new versions using &#8220;duplicate version&#8221; and then add metadata later that really applies to ALL versions of that particular image. Inconsistent image metadata between variations is a killer. Obviously if this is on purpose and is version specific then that is okay but in general most keywords, copyright, location, faces, etc are things you want to do first.</li>
    <li>Make color labels globally meaningful for every project.</li>
    <li>Fix any time zone or time skew issues immediately after or during import - doing time math a year down the road really sucks. Trust me you will not remember especially if you use two or more cameras on the same project that are different from each other.</li>
    <li>Trust me when I say naming your versions differently than the actual master file names leads to hell and will bite you in the ass when you absolutely do not have the time to figure it out.</li>
    <li>Make your overall stack pick mean something across all projects. I know this sounds a little draconian but it helps a lot. For me all stack picks are pretty much the un-digitally-molested version with maybe a few corrections that apply across all possible &#8220;variations&#8221;.  In general they are NOT images with all the &#8220;final&#8221; images that went out for printing or whatever - those are versions with their own album. Doing this makes a lot of sense when combined with WHY you actually go after old images in a search - usually it has NOTHING to do with what you were doing 5 years ago. It also suddenly makes that &#8220;show stack picks only&#8221; checkbox in the search HUD much more useful. If you want to see all your variations use &#8220;show image in project&#8221; and take a look at your albums in that project.</li>
    <li>If you are not sure about an added ajustment - make a new version and album to contain it. Far easier to just get rid of these versions than it is to back out adjustments you do not want from your one &#8220;pristine&#8221; unmolested version that happens to be your stack pick. See a theme here? Want to try a preset? If you take this advice at any time on any project you are about 3 keyboard shortcuts away from doing just that for any number of images in any project you worked on at any point in your Aperture life because all your projects have the &#8220;original&#8221; &#8220;pristine&#8221; as the stack pick at the top level of all projects. Get it now?</li>
    <li>Don&#8217;t treat Aperture features as &#8220;static&#8221; set it and forget it type things. Use them for the task at hand. Example - keyword &#8220;button sets&#8221;. If you don&#8217;t have one that applies to the project at hand, make one. It takes about 5 seconds and will save you tons of time in the very fist project. You will also find that very quickly you will already have a keyword button set that makes sense for almost any project you do. You don&#8217;t have to have some sort of &#8220;let me make a button set for all the things I can think of&#8221; outside the task of actually keywording images. Use these kinds of things &#8220;on the fly&#8221; now.</li>
</ul>


<p>I will leave you with that food for thought - pretty much some clarifications of the post referenced at the top. If you have no idea what any of this means take a look at my <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2010/08/15/aperture-organization/">Organization eBook</a> or at least my <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2010/08/25/aperture-3-stacks-and-albums/">Stacks and Albums</a> screencast.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I tried but just cannot help myself, I resisted for a while but just can&#8217;t hold out any more. I love these rants&#8230;</p>

<iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/EDWeAHd6D6w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>I do love film. I put my New Year&#8217;s resolution off for a while but one of the things that is on the list is to shoot more color slide film before it all goes away. The stuff looks fantastic directly from the lab. The color palette is unique to each film and quite unique from digital. Yes I have tried all the simulations but they do not cut it. It&#8217;s not just an overall color balance or level of saturation. It&#8217;s the relationships between the colors. Somehow subtle but in general more &#8220;separated&#8221;. I love it. Even color neg film is different. Maybe tomorrow I will scan on of my StupidCrap™ images I shot on that 10+ year old Kodak Portra a few months ago just to show you guys.</p>

<p>The real motive for <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/02/06/nikon-f3-give-away/">giving away a Nikon F3</a> is to maybe give someone the incentive to shoot 400 bucks worth of film instead of buying yet another $400 disposable digicam. That should be enough to get themselves sufficiently addicted. I hope - that way there will be some to by for me and a few other like minded people.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Of course this is in the context of the Nikon F3 giveaway. I got a couple of question regarding lenses I like to use on Nikon manual focus cameras. What the heck, I&#8217;ll answer that with a post. Please understand that this is more for non-Nikon, non-film people more than it is for Nikon aficionados. It&#8217;s not an objective list, it&#8217;s more of a personal gut feel list with a couple of variations chucked in.</p>

<p>The Nikon can mount and use just about any Nikon lens - the only exception is the brand new G series lenses. It can mount and use Non-AI (made since 1959), AI, and AIS, as well as AF and AF-D, lenses including AF-S lenses as long as they have an Aperture ring. My general preference for &#8220;feel&#8221; and value are going to be AI or AIS lenses but&#8230; Non-AI lenses from way back, including the single coated variety are just a tiny bit harder to use (just use stop down metering in manual or shoot wide open) not really a big deal and can sometimes be had for a few dollars. As for modern lenses - yes they are fine but the really fantastic ones are not cheap.</p>

<p>So&#8230; If you like wide I would go for&#8230;. the 18mm F3.5 - fantastic lens that can be had for less than $400 in great condition. This lens is absolutely great. Very little distortion, sharp, good color, awesome angle of view, reasonable close focus, well built - like all manual focus Nikons. If you must than get the 20 3.5 or 20 2.8 - these are way less &#8216;rare&#8217; but for some reason fetch about the same money. They are also not quite as good - not that you&#8217;ll really know in real world shooting. Not so wide - 28 F2 - just because it&#8217;s there. In beteween go for the 24mm F2 or F2.8 if you want &#8220;better&#8221; on a budget.</p>

<p>Normal - 50mm 1.4 AIS by far - budget? Okay 50 2.0/1.8 AI for convienece and great performance or for me - a wacko - even less money on a pristine Non-AI 50 1.4 single coated. A little less convienient a little less contrast but a work of art and astonishingly good, plus it looks the coolest out of the bunch.</p>

<p>Short tele - this one is easy the 105 2.5 is fantastic and cheap, the 85 1.4 is fantastic and expensive the 85 1.8 (all AI/AIS) is just as good but ho-hum so I would chuck all those and just get the AI/AIS 135 2.0 - unbelievable DOF effects and good - don&#8217;t worry that it&#8217;s beat up - as long as it works get the cheap ugly one.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Part of the Aperture 3 SuperSimpleStuff™ series. You probably know that I don&#8217;t talk a whole lot about image adjustments. I have reasons for that that I won&#8217;t go through right now but suffice it to say they are the icing on the cake, not the actual cake. I wanted to post something that I hope will help people just starting out get over a hump that seems to be a common theme that I hear. You old timers stick around to - there may be a tidbit that can help you with your Aperture specific endeavors as well.</p>

<p>The &#8220;hump&#8221; I am talking about is what we&#8217;ll call image adjustment anxiety. What I mean by this is the question of what adjustment &#8220;should&#8221; I use to do something. Heck there are a bunch of them. There are even a bunch that seem to have overlapping effects and function. &#8220;Which one is the RIGHT one to use?&#8221;. Okay here is the cure-all for image adjustment anxiety. Are you ready?</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t worry about it. Yes, there are lots and lots and lots of ways to get to exactly the same place and infinitely more ways to get to pretty much the same place. Once you get past the &#8220;right way to do it&#8221; anxiety you will be much better off. Here are a couple of really simple guide lines with a few Aperture 3 specific things thrown in.</p>

<ul>
    <li> Use the easiest most direct method to get to where you want to go. Yep - half the reason for all these different controls that sorta affect the same things is because in some cases it&#8217;s easier to use one vs the other for a particular task at hand. It can also be a case of familiarity. Like to use curves instead of the contrast slider? Go ahead do whatever is quickest and easiest for you.</li>
    <li>Of course you have heard this one everywhere - Aperture control blocks show up in the order that you &#8220;should&#8221; approach things that need multiple adjustments. This is generally true but do not let it make you do things that make no sense to getting what you want the quickest easiest way to get it. Don&#8217;t feel you must use the contrast slider before you use a curves or level tool - that&#8217;s just insane.</li>
    <li>Okay, now we are on to some more practical matters specific to Aperture 3. The first one is that some Aperture adjustments &#8220;stack&#8221; and others don&#8217;t. Specifically you cannot add multiple exposure bricks but you can add multiple curves bricks.The biggest thing about this for me is choosing wisely how you implement presets. An example would be choosing to implement an overall &#8220;look&#8217; with both the exposure brick and maybe a color brick. Now this is not a big deal but I usually reserve the exposure brick for per image tweaks instead of using it in presets. This way I can go through my images and do any minor image &#8220;correction&#8221; tweaks using the exposure brick and have confidence that my &#8220;image look&#8221; presets that use a curves brick will not undo my per image corrections made with the exposure brick. Don&#8217;t underestimate this level of planning or write it off as minor. If you do shooting that involves a large number of images that may need overall corrections and then a few predefined &#8220;looks&#8221; applied to them (say weddings) this can be a huge time saver and generally you want to think about things like this in terms of your overall work-flow efficiency.</li>
    <li>Aperture 3 noise reduction sucks. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, Aperture has it&#8217;s automagic RAW processing noise thing it does that is pretty good. I am talking about it&#8217;s Noise reduction adjustment brick. I have written it off as useless and slow.</li>
</ul>


<p>That&#8217;s enough for now. The main point is do what is easy and what looks good. Don&#8217;t worry too too much about order or &#8220;righteousness&#8221; when going about using Aperture 3 adjustments. I do promise to be a bit more disiplined in posting more SuperSimpleStuff™ and some more specific thoughts on adjustments. For those of you waiting and asking me about the Aperture 3 adjustment eBook - I&#8217;m workin&#8217; on it. I have re-re-re-written it about 3 times so far. I don&#8217;t want to regurgitate &#8220;here is what each block does&#8221; kind of stuff. I want it to be more work-flow oriented, practical, and above all more about the &#8220;why&#8221; not the &#8220;what&#8221;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, the game is on. I am giving away a Nikon F3. It&#8217;s not going to be one of the two &#8220;mint&#8221; condition F3&#8217;s. It&#8217;s not going to be my beater either. Nothing too pretty. It doesn&#8217;t really matter they all work the same. I guess it&#8217;s going to be one of the middle of the road F3&#8217;s I have. It&#8217;s better that way. The one I use all the time is my beater - the really ugly one. Why? because I don&#8217;t care if it looks different when I am done shooting. Truth be told - it looks the same as when I got it. I think getting one in &#8220;definitely been used, probably by a PJ at some point&#8221; will be a bit of psychological freedom for people that are too worried about getting a mark on their too too pretty camera. That and an F3 actually looks okay sans paint - you see it&#8217;s black paint on brass so used = good.</p>

<p>Anyway - if you want it here are the few simple &#8220;rules&#8221; to be in the running. I have a very very niche site so there will not be billions of people - probably just a few that will be in the running. This is mainly to promote the use of film and classic gear that still has many miles left before it quits. Secondarily it&#8217;s to have a bit of fun looking at what each other write and post on our prospective sites - or facebook pages or whatever. So here goes:</p>

<ol>
    <li>You must post something somewhere - anything that in some way relates to a Nikon F3 and film. Doesn&#8217;t matter but the theme should be why the heck you want the thing. It can be as simple as a photo and a caption that says - I wish I would have shot this image with a Nikon F3. It can be as complicated, philosophical, goofy, sentimental, whatever as you want. The more closely related to WHY you want it the better but do whatever you want just be a tiny tiny bit creative. Post anywhere - your own blog, your site, facebook, tumbler, posterous, I don&#8217;t care. Some how link back to this post. Get it?</li>
    <li>At some point between now and let&#8217;s say March 15th, 2011 you must also tweet with a hashtag of #NikonF3 and a link to this post as well as your own post (see above #1)</li>

<p>That&#8217;s it. On March 15th, 2011 I will divide up all the good posts from the not so good posts and randomly select a winner for the good pool. Just my way of sorting out yo-yo&#8217;s that don&#8217;t really want to deal with the F3 but follow the rules to the letter. Don&#8217;t worry I will have an impartial judge keep me honest on the &#8220;not so good&#8221; rejects. Don&#8217;t worry too much about getting reject - think of it more like a spam filtering vs some sort of contest for the most wonderfullest post.</p>

<p>Okay - Game on!</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. Shot this with my F3 at some point. Plus-x developed in D76.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know I talk about film and digital. I am not &#8220;anti&#8221; either medium. I probably talk about film more than I &#8220;should&#8221; given that 99% of people reading this either don&#8217;t shoot film or never have. I do this because I do believe it is a worthwhile endeavor for many many reasons - hence the <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/02/04/nikon-f3-i-think-i-am-cornering-the-market/">F3 giveaway</a> that I will be putting together later this month. I shot film for longer than digital has been around. I still do and I still learn things in doing so. It&#8217;s also a nice change of pace, a nice bit of freedom in many cases but make no mistake it&#8217;s not just nostalgic and quaint.</p>

<p>Film is no slouch in it&#8217;s proper context and used correctly. When you optimize your equipment and format size for it&#8217;s intended purpose and output it can shine like nothing else. Of course you can subject it to all the digital torture you wish in all it&#8217;s 16 bit tonal depth glory. Even without that a simple camera that is currently &#8220;obsolete&#8221; can not only be a pleasure to use and experience but equipment you couldn&#8217;t have dreamed of affording can also give you stellar results in digital for the price of a quality scan.</p>

<p>Take my winter doldrums project from last year. The goal was to get shooting in the mid-winder depression I always experience. I decided to shoot a subject that I am not very good at and consider extremely challenging as I do not see many decent images of trees from anywhere. I find some trees very interesting but have never been able to put the on film in any competent way. I decided to shoot a winter tree series on medium format Kodak TMAX 100 black and white film, develop them in Pyrocat HD, and of course make real black and white prints from the acceptable negatives. I still can&#8217;t shoot landscape or trees for shit but at least I was shooting, learning, and was better than last time I tried.</p>

<p>Since my output medium was pure analog I didn&#8217;t pay for a decent drum scan but for illustration purposes I used my crappy ass Nikon 8000ED - it&#8217;s okay, it&#8217;s 14 bit but if I were going for the gold I would have it scanned on a drum scanner at 8000dpi and 16bits - that&#8217;s 324 MEGA pixels for you digital heads. TMAX100 may actually benefit and have the detail to warrant a file that big. With todays scanner technology and competent operation I can tell you that that file will blow away just about anything you would or could buy today - of course 3200 speed film would not but it would still be fantastic.</p>

<p>Want to really do landscape - try competing with the same scan of a 4x5 negative. The kit can be had for a song - relatively speaking. If you ever wanted to now is the time to shoot film. The only thing standing in your way is a couple of dollars in cost and a small wait when you do. Is everything you shoot really really really important to have out the door in 5 minutes? Hell shoot digital on something acceptable AND shoot film when you really mean it.</p>

<p>Just some food for thought. I am not going to bother posting the traditional &#8220;100%&#8221; bullshit. If you can&#8217;t surmise the level of detail TMAX100 or similar color film can capture with a modern Zeiss 40mm CFi FLE  or similar quality lens on medium format from the small one than there is nothing I am going to do that will convince you to trust me on this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Got an email a few minutes ago. &#8220;Why give a Nikon F3?&#8221; - the obvious context of the question is - <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/02/04/nikon-f3-i-think-i-am-cornering-the-market/">why do I have 5 of them and why would I give one away</a>. Hmmm. To be blunt I want to figure out how to promote my site a little, that is the give-away part. Obviously I won&#8217;t bother if I can&#8217;t make it fun or nobody is really interested. Now here is the non-obvious part or maybe why not a cheapy plastic digital, or some software - I have a bunch of extra software licenses and unopened boxes and of course - why the heck do I have 5 Nikon F3&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Well - I preach that photography is photography and some of the classic tools are not only great but are worthwhile as image making devices - above all they are really a wonder to hold, operate and use. I figure there are enough photography enthusiasts that happen across my site that really don&#8217;t have a lot of up close experience with 20-30 year old tools or film and may not go out of their way to play around with trying to find one that is good and is cheap on eBay - maybe they just wouldn&#8217;t want to spend the time but&#8230; If someone made it easy and fun to own one no questions asked they would enjoy it - if only occasionally. Well that&#8217;s my goal.</p>

<p>Now moving on to the F3 - To be blunt - it is a modern classic. It&#8217;s modern enough that there are no huge obstacles to using it every once in a while. When I say obstacles I am talking about indexing a lens&#8217; max aperture, or goofy way to load film, or any real waving of chicken bones to make a picture. It&#8217;s exactly the right camera that bridges the way simple but professional cameras worked back in the old days and the way DSLR&#8217;s work today.</p>

<p>For example - you wind the film, classic vs the camera does it like an F4 or F5 - they are more like the way a DSLR operates, esp an F5, but they happen to need film. No need for stop down metering and such that is too esoteric for anyone that grew up digital to ever deal with. That and a few other things.</p>

<ul>
    <li>The F3 is sensuous to operate. Everything feels good down to the way the film winds.</li>
    <li>The viewfinder is fantastic. Really.</li>
    <li>The shutter is accurate even if it has not been serviced because it is quartz timed.</li>
    <li>With 80/20 metering and the well conceived AE lock button you can be precise in exposure and FAST.</li>
    <li>Built like a tank - almost indestructible.</li>
    <li>A functional work of design art.</li>
    <li>Super simple and minimalistic - only what you need to make a picture nothing more.</li>
    <li>Come on now the sound of the F3 shutter with MD-4 motor drive is THE camera sound that has been heard on every modern movie EVER, even when they are shooting digital the sound track is still a motorized F3. Need I say more?</li>
</ul>


<p>Better yet - why not?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just snagged another Nikon F3 body w/ MD4 motor drive for $100. I cannot believe these things are so cheap. They are a deal at the normal going eBay rate of $200 - #250 for a nice user condition camera. Of course the truly &#8220;mint&#8221; and &#8220;special&#8221; ones bring big bucks but the everyday &#8220;regular&#8221; ones in great shape are a steal. These things are so cheap that I feel kind of guilty snapping them all up. I have like 5 of them and just one will probably last a lifetime.</p>

<p>I have given stuff like this away to friends/family/deserving acquaintances before. I am thinking that maybe I should give one away to one of your readers out there that has not shot film or ever had a classic Nikon MF body. The only issue is exactly how to do it. Most of my site registrations are spam so that&#8217;s out of the question. Most people probably want nothing to do with it anyway so again - not a great idea. Giving it to a non-Nikon shooter with NO way to stick a lens on it is out, unless of course I also give away a lens.</p>

<p>What I want to do is give it to someone that would actually use it occasionally. Someone that actually WANTS it. Well I guess I will go through the thought process and headache of setting up a way to give it away, maybe with a lens if there is any interest at all.</p>

<p>So here is the question&#8230;. Any one interested in a free Nikon F3 - maybe with a manual focus lens of some sort? Would you actually shoot it? If you have a second answer the poll and even more appreciated share some thoughts on the idea - how to do it, lens/no-lens, stupid idea, great idea, I want it, you may as well just keep it, whatever - feel free.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well both <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/02/01/the-verdict-is-in-i-am-completely-mad-another-bag/">bags</a> came this morning and they are both &#8220;nice&#8221;. I will probably keep the Moderate Embarrassment even though the laptop compartment completely dwarfs  the 11 inch mackbook air. We&#8217;ll see. The tiny little one DOES NOT come close to fitting the 11 inch air. It fits side-ways but lengthwise it is a no go. I was hoping since they advertise it with some netbooks. It is going back or&#8230; I have to get an iPad for it.</p>
