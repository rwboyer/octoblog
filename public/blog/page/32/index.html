  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Ap3D2H.jpg"><img title="Ap3D2H.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/.thumbs/.Ap3D2H.jpg" border="0" alt="Ap3D2H.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="94" align="left" /></a>This is for our friend Paul. He asked for some starting points for the D2H in Aperture so here are a few to get started. Just as a note - the D2H has perennially been one of the most difficult NEF files to dial-in due to continuous bizarre but subtle white balance issues in Aperture. This has been true since Aperture V1 but has improved over time. I have to say somewhere in the last few updates I could swear it got better but why? I think myself and Paul are probably the only ones that still shoot this camera on the planet. Yea the D3 is way better in a lot of ways but&#8230;</p>

<p>The D2H really raised the bar as far has how responsive a camera could and should be. The funny thing is if you pick up a D2H today it shoots a whole lot like a D3 - really. Super fast, super responsive, solid as a brick. Great camera. I still use mine on occasion when I give lighting workshops - 4 Mpix files really rock in terms of transfer and processing speed. I tether wirelessly and display on a huge HD display - the images look fantastic and the displayed the instant I hit the shutter. In fact the display pretty much keeps up no matter how fast I shoot.</p>

<p>Anyway - warning these images may not be safe for work - I got too many complaints from the boob police last time I posted anything like this. Also note that I did NO white balance correction in the presets - that is useless unless you shoot at a constant color temp (I do but not many others so I left it out) there are a couple of WB issues still there and are not compensated for in these presets. Consider them a starting point. Go wild - let me know what you come up with. There are a million ways to get to the end result - I chose the really simple one but you could probably do all of it or at least most of it in curves with maybe one other adjustment.</p>

<p>Here are some quick and dirty starting point Presets for the D2h they are - D2x mode 3 (gotta love that), Picture Control Standard and Vivid. You can do Portrait and Landscape on your own. They are close enough for government work.</p>

<p>Presets [download id= &#8220;19&#8221;]</p>

<p>and to go along with that here are a couple D2H NEF files to play with as well - I chose these because they are the difficult ones to get right. In general a lot of Nikon cameras will need the yellows and oranges shifted a little more towards red to match what NX2 does from a color standpoint - make sure you have the other stuff right first - you can go down the wrong path if your WB, contrast, and tonal values are not matching before you start shifting hues around.</p>

I thought I covered this enough times before but&#8230; Here is a Nikon D50 NEF preset that happens to &#8220;match&#8221; what NX2 does with our friends camera settings - which NOTHING else reads by default. You can get to the same place about 1000 different ways. I just chose to do it this way. In reality if I were doing this over again for all my stuff (I will) I would use the curves to do all of the stuff instead of the Exposure block - maybe. I actually need more image samples to get this right as I do not have a D50 but I thought I would put this out there for the gillions of new Aperture 3 users that will be scratching their heads and asking - Hey how come Aperture&#8217;s RAW conversion for NEF files doesn&#8217;t look &#8220;good&#8221;. Here it is and it doesn&#8217;t cost anything - if you don&#8217;t like it - tweak it to your liking.</p>

<p>If anyone is interested I will be happy to post a bunch of NX2 &#8220;matching&#8217; presets for picture controls for all of the cameras I own. D2H, D2X, D3,  D200. If there are others let me know. Here is a D50 - let&#8217;s call it the &#8220;Manu&#8221; in camera settings recipe. Ps those are his wonderful images in the screen shot - can you tell which one is NX2 vs Ap? I can but I am not looking at a compressed JPG screenshot. I can&#8217;t help but make the Aperture one the same but slightly &#8220;better&#8221;.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. Beware of the 1000&#8217;s of people that will be selling &#8220;valuable&#8221; presets for Aperture 3. Let&#8217;s face it folks presets ain&#8217;t Viveza and are not nearly as sophisticated as say&#8230; really complicated Photoshop actions.</p>

<p>Pss. These are Manu&#8217;s beautiful images - he is a very very good photographer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Ap3Places.jpg"><img title="Ap3Places.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/.thumbs/.Ap3Places.jpg" border="0" alt="Ap3Places.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="92" align="left" /></a>I have used Aperture 3 since yesterday morning and stayed up until the wee hours. I will obviously post a lot of first impressions but I wanted to get this one out while it is still fresh. Overall this is way more than I expected as an update. There are some things in my wish list that are not there and some nice surprises. Some of my comments are first impressions and I may change my opinion as time goes on.</p>

<p>First - there are some bugs - nothing earth shattering but they are there. I am confident that Apple will nail these pretty quickly. It is faster - if you have the hardware and if you are intelligent about using it. Just like before. You can pile on intensive adjustments and do things that are not a smart way to go about doing them and bring Aperture 3 to it&#8217;s knees. I am sure we will hear lots of complaints about this. For me - it is faster. Aperture has always been fast but also very easy to ask it to do insane amounts of work easily as well.</p>

<p>Just about everything in my eBooks is still very relevant - actually critical in using Aperture effectively. File management, Organization, work-flow, even the book tool eBooks are spot on. With the exception of a couple of new twists on project and library import and export. I will not comment on these until I really put them through there paces. Today I want to offer my impressions on the UI changes and three headline new features.</p>

<p>For the most part I do not like most of the UI changes - they are okay and most of what I love is still there but there are a couple of things that get in my way as well as the new UI associated with Faces/Places. For the most part the UI has dumb-down features so the first time you fire it up it is &#8220;easier&#8221; - this is debatable considering most of the power is still not &#8220;obvious&#8221;. I do not like the new RAW+JPG, in my opinion it is a dummy feature that provides no new functionality and gets in the way. It will stop the incessant question of &#8220;Hey where are my JPGs&#8221; for people that care not to explore the context menus for more than 4 seconds. For me it adds an extra step. I guess if you shoot RAW+JPG and ONLY want to screw with the JPGs then it saves you a step. Easy album access to both it costs a step no matter how you slice it.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Aperture trash&#8221; is stupid. Yes it will save inexperienced users some pain - once. For everyone else - it is an extra step. Now you have multiple redundant &#8220;Are you sure&#8221; steps reminiscent of Windoze. Reject the image, review your rejects, get rid of them, empty the aperture trash, empty the system trash. Good for casual users - bad for Pro users. Both the Faces and Places UI decisions seem to be hung on the side of the rest of Aperture - sure they work in whatever context you are in like everything else but&#8230; You have to use the mouse - no shortcut keys - I will fix this but out of the box there is no standard shortcut keys so it is a huge disruption if you are used to using shortcuts to change what is or is not on the screen without the mouse. So you can cycle viewer/browser/spit but to activate Faces or Places it is the mouse - to deactivate the mouse again - wouldn&#8217;t it me nice if the V key at least cycled you back or something. The Faces UI is pure iPhoto only worse. The Places is better but needs huge improvement to fit in with the rest of the Aperture UI. The local adjustments and multi zoom UI is fantastic - so are the new full screen modes.</p>

<p>Faces - I have spent significant amount of time with Faces - I will try to find a pro use for it but this is pure casual user gee wiz at the moment. I know Apple has to have this for graduating iPhoto people but for the most part it seems to be useful only as a casual user tool like if you shoot a limited number of fairly diverse people like your immediate and extended family. If you shoot lots of people - even dozens let alone hundreds and a lot of them have a similar demographic it is worthless. It also seems to have no other connection with Aperture metadata than just itself. Keywords are faster, easier, and a better way to do this for now. Faces is a giant waste of time. I am tenacious and will continue to try to find a way where it will improve your workflow - casual or pro - when I get there you will know.</p>

<p>Places on the other hand is fantastic - except for some of the UI that I hope will improve and feel more a part of Aperture as time goes on. It is simple, powerful, doesn&#8217;t seem to have glitches, the searches and metadata are well integrated into Aperture. Well done. I am in the middle of a second gigantic snow storm within the last few days so I had to make  a cigarette run to stock up while I am trapped. I tested the Places stuff in Aperture 3.</p>

<p>I took two cameras and shot them while driving (not a good idea). I also took my Garmin 76CSx marine GPS. I got home, imported the images, clicked on the Places button in the toolbar, imported the GPS track data, selected the images and drug them to the track on the map. Aperture 3 asked me if I wanted to tag the images based on time, I answered yes. Bang done. Fantastic. This is a great UI. I wish the place definition was a little more direct but it is easy enough. If you have a GPS and you can get at the track data - you can have geotaged images no matter how many cameras you shoot. The workflow is really really fast compared to anything else I have used. Good work Apple. (screen shot at the top)</p>

<p>Local adjustments are fantastic but they take a little getting used to. You need a tablet - or at least a magic mouse to be productive. Just one tip the strokes are cumulative but&#8230; Only if the strenth slider is set low. In other words the maximum degree of the effect is the amount slider. If the strength slider is all the way up that is it for the brushing. To work like you do in PS set the amount higher in the adjustment inspector and the strength slider low in the brush controls then you can paint in the effect cumulatively. This should be obvious but I am pointing it out for people not super used to local adjustments.</p>

<p>Okay - not a real educational post but I did want to share some &#8220;feelings&#8221; and see what all of your thoughts were as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yep - he loves it. He has been an Aperture user for a long long long time - almost as long as me. He feels about Aperture 3 the way he felt about the D3. <a href="http://www.joemcnally.com/blog/2010/02/09/aperture-3-was-my-idea/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+joemcnally+%28Joe+McNally%27s+Blog%29">You can read his notes here</a>. He was a beta user and has been using it for months. You will have to wait another day on my first impressions. So take a gander at his not so first impressions.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. There are a couple of bugs - nothing earth shattering yet but a stumble here and there. Subtle, these will get fixed quick in all likelihood.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay I just saw a tweet from a <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/146231/2010/02/aperture3.html">MacWorld</a> article that Aperture 3 is here. This is it. I was right this morning. I felt it in my bones. Sorry for the quick rumor to validation cycle.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Update here is the <a href="http://www.apple.com/aperture/">Apple Aperture 3 Page</a></p>

<p>Update - i have been reading the new features this is what I expected it is awesome, library sync, there are a couple of headline features that I knew would be there from iPhoto but there is real meat here - not just fluff plus 64bit</p>

<p>Update: The org stuff is amazing more than I expected. IPTC core support - lots of metadata goodness that I really wanted and more. Write to master IPTC metadata - yes yes yes - this is an LR killer and a photomechanic killer. XMP import.</p>

<p>Aperture 3 is killer.</p>

<p>Update: The adjustments updates seem fantastic - local adjustments that look useful, tablet support, real curves, presets, really amazing stuff - this is a Lightroom killer.</p>

<p>Update: Video support - take that Lightroom. I didn&#8217;t think it would be there but it is.</p>

<p>Awesome new print tools, awesome new book tools, fantastic interface improvements to an already superlative product. I wonder what the LR yo-yo&#8217;s will say to this - They didn&#8217;t get it before - now what.</p>

<p>Update: I know some of you will be thrilled - larger fonts in the UI - I am not thrilled about that but everything else makes up for it - this is truly a killer upgrade.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Ap3.jpg"><img title="Ap3.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/.thumbs/.Ap3.jpg" border="0" alt="Ap3.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="94" align="left" /></a>Okay so I said I was not going to do this but I am going to offer an upgrade price. If you purchased ANY of my Aperture eBooks I am going to offer a low low upgrade price. It doesn&#8217;t matter when you purchased it you will get an upgrade. I don&#8217;t want to fool around with dates and fairness and all that.</p>

<p>I am doing this because I love this community and I volunteer to help people - I believe in the product so much. Much of the work-flow advice that I give in the eBooks is absolutely spot on. Aperture 3 adds some new twists especially with more than one computer. I will have my existing eBook library updated ASAP - probably this month as I am going to do it full time but take the proper care to make them the best out there at any price.</p>

<p>That being said - if you buy one now you will get the upgrade price, if you have one you will get the upgrade price. If you do not have one the prices are going up when the new ones are out. They will still be the best value in the Aperture 3 universe. They will be the best at the lowest price but I am going to do some new things like screencast videos etc. So whatever you buy now or later you will pay the same amount. That is the only fair way that I can do it. I am not going to penalizing my existing customers for buying them too soon.</p>

<p>The reason that I started doing this in the first place is that there were not a whole lot of accurate, innovative information on this amazing product. I don&#8217;t believe in regurgitating the manual - that is not what you get. When I survey the landscape out there the price vs information is not there. It is here - since I am going to invest a ton of time in this I am going to have to raise my prices - a little bit.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. I was right on holding off on the adjustments and the metadata eBooks - they are the ones that are changing in a gigantic way.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>OMG - All the Apple Stores are down - check it. Could this mean we get Aperture 3 today? Maybe some macbook pro upgrades?. Boy oh boy.  Everybody cross your fingers. Tons of chatter on the web that this is it along with iLife &#8216;10. We will see.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Update - I am hearing that some people have official press releases that Aperture 3 is here. I will be updating this page all day today until we know for sure.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Remember how pissed I was at <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2010/01/21/pdn-is-offering-a-reward-for-pictures-of-aperture-3/">PDN for taking the stance that nobody was waiting on Aperture 3</a>? Well I am right and they were wrong. It is a freaking twitter trending topic - right up there with Haiti and Tiger Woods or whatever celebrity gossip is the news of the day.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hey I know this guy is super duper popular for his introducing the everyman out there to using flash (even though he talks cheap and actually uses expensive things and big lights now or like 12 SB900&#8217;s). I have to admit he has done some cool stuff way back but I just have to ask WTF lately?</p>

<p>I am a little picky - I admit it. I think 99% of commercial images published today are at best mediocre - formulaic - flat - juiced up in PS. I blame the audience for being so&#8230; accepting of what amounts to juiced up crappy images shot with not much care nor attention to detail. So what kind of glue was he on when he <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidhobby/4322699389/sizes/o/">shot these images</a>? Here is the <a href="http://strobist.blogspot.com/2010/02/on-assignment-trip-jennings.html">blog post</a> if you want to learn how NOT to position your lights, unfortunately he does not detail how he set his camera and gelled the lights to get one of the most horrific color balances I have ever seen between background, fill, and key.</p>

<p>Is it me? Are you this lax? I sure hope you can see what has me all twisted up here.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/DSC_0724.jpg"><img title="DSC_0724.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/.thumbs/.DSC_0724.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_0724.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="101" align="left" /></a>I have written more than a couple of times of the ills of using matrix or evaluative metering along with TTL flash. Personally my opinion is that these &#8220;innovations&#8221; no matter how wondrous are more trouble and more work than they are worth. This has nothing to do with me not understanding how the controls and camera work. Of course they are useful in situations where you really really have to be quick and you have no time to think and you have to get the shot and you&#8217;ve only got one shot at it.</p>

<p>The reality is if you are taking the time to place more than one light or even one light with ambient by definition you are not in that situation. Manual control is quicker, it&#8217;s easier, it gives you more consistent shot to shot results and you will get exactly what you want. Instead of railing against that today (well I guess I just did) I wanted to post a 30 second exercise that I just did with my auto everything DSLR and point out some things if you insist on wrestling against the computer in your camera with the &#8220;quick and easy way&#8221;.</p>

<p>For these I used two flashes on TTL w/ compensation controlled wirelessly via a D200 in commander mode. The shot at the top is just ambient metered the way I would probably do this kind of thing in a pinch, it actually retains good atmosphere - I would just stick a person in it and make sure the wonderful window light was hitting them the way I wanted it to. If I had to retain detail in the room and the background I guess you have to do flash or some nutty HDR stuff.</p>

<p>Here is matrix metering alone.</p>

<p><img title="DSC_0720.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/DSC_0720.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_0720.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="500" height="335" /></p>

<p>Here is on camera TTL flash - cool we have a perfect exposure that looks like absolute shit. If this is how you use your flash I would suggest getting a hammer and breaking it your images will thank you.</p>

<p><img title="DSC_0721.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/DSC_0721.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_0721.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="500" height="335" /></p>

<p>Okay - now we need detail in the room and the background but I want a similar sense of atmosphere that we had without the strobes. What do we do? Well as best we can we try to mimic what the natural light is doing and reproduce it&#8217;s direction as much as possible - from the back with front shadows that are just a higher value. Okay step one put a flash behind the flowers and backlight them, let it do double duty and put some light on the ceiling as well but we need to block it from the wall the windows are on with a handy dandy magazine scrim. Turn it up a notch to give it some direction. Step two fill in the shadows with soft light that mimics the way the ambient light is working. Move it around until the relationships are similar to the shot at the top of the post. Okay now we have a little bit to dark in just a couple of areas - turn the on camera flash on and way way down so it doesn&#8217;t cast it&#8217;s own shadows  Crap it is reflecting in the window - change position a bit so the reflection is somewhat hidden by overlapping it with a natural highlight.</p>

<p><img title="DSC_0734.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/DSC_0734.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_0734.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="500" height="335" /></p>

<p>There we have it - quick and easy matrix adjusted TTL powered PIA IR remote that won&#8217;t let you  place the lights exactly where you want them wonderfulness.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. The lesson was try to emulate what you like in natural lighting conditions no matter what lights you use. Seriously. Oh and the corollary was to not worry too much the background let it go white it is rarely important anyway. Make a conscious decision on what you are photographing and what detail adds to the image - Some of the best photographs do not have detail everywhere - in fact most of them don&#8217;t.</p>
