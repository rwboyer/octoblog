  <div class="entry-content"><p>Normal people try to get the best quatifiable bang for their buck. Normal people that are willing to slam down $1400 in hard earned cash for a new MacBook Air no doubt end up getting the 13&#8221;. I mean who the crap would spend that much on the 11.6 inch model? You would have to be out of your mind. Wouldn&#8217;t you?</p>

<p>Come on, the 13 has a better, bigger screen. It has a faster processor no matter how you slice it. It has a better, longer lasting battery. It has the same 4Gig of memory for the same dinero. Let&#8217;s see - better - better - better. I&#8217;ll take the less better one please. Yep, I maxed out everything on the 11.6 incher and it priced out pretty much the same as a better spec&#8217;d 13.3.</p>

<p>You might say WTF - right. Maybe you are facing the same set of decisions and your highly trained auto reaction is to hit the buy button on the one that is &#8220;better. Here is some food for thought for you:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Both 11.6 and 13.3 are too too small to do &#8220;big screen&#8221; kind of work on where you need a ton of info blasted at you at the same time. This is the realm of 15&#8221;HD minium (if you like to squint to see the tiny stuff). I got that in my top of the line 15&#8221; MBP. Okay so you don&#8217;t have one of those like me. And you also don&#8217;t have a MacPro w/ 2x27&#8221; Cinemas like me. Great - get a 27&#8221; with a wireless keyboard and mouse for &#8220;big&#8221; work. Both of the MBA&#8217;s will drive it fine.</p></li>
<li><p>Back on point - I am going to write and code on this thing while I am actually portable. I mean really portable. Make mine the small. When I write and/or code, activities that suck down a lot of my time, I <em>live</em> in Terminal.app or full screen wordprocessor of the day (Pages, WriteRoom, Scrivener, etc.) These apps look great fullscreen on either MacBook Air. The look stupid in fullscreen HD+. Well at least they look stupid when you are in type the text mode.</p></li>
<li><p>For my real work pattern of work - close lid - think - open - type - close lid. The 11.6 batter will go all day. That&#8217;s good enough for me.</p></li>
<li><p>1.6Ghz C2D vs 1.83Ghz - for writing/codeing heck even compiling - as we all know unless you are rebuilding all of GNU over and over - anything you can buy (except and Atom) is too too fast to even catch a smoke and think before the build is done.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>My MacBook Air intent is small and focused. I want the smallest and mosted focused device. So why did I max it out. Ummmm now that I think about it, maybe I shouldn&#8217;t have. Ahh what the heck - 128G is not that much storage - I do like my HD. And you just gotta have 4G so you can fire up a couple of server images using Vagrant to test on, etc. Oh and I gotta run Aperture in a pinch without out growing old.</p>

<p>Good luck with your decisions - I waffled on this since the annoucement and finally did the deed today.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am a bit rusty on my CP/CMS commands so I tried googling the syntax of something regarding DASD. What I found were about 300 endless threads about setting up new DASD for use as Mini Disks for CMS users. Most of the discussion was off on wild tangents and never really answered the newbie that asked the questions. Here is the long and short of it assuming you have the ever popular starter VM/370 system up and running in hercules.</p>

<p>You will have to know a tiny bit of CMS like how to copy files and use the editor but not a whole lot of other things. This is sort of a place holder in case I have to refer some other people to it.</p>

<script src='http://pastie.org/1303542.js'></script>


<p>I am assuming you are logged on as MAINT and that you have made a copy of the default directory (I believe it is called &#8220;RELEASE6 DIRECT&#8221; on MAINT&#8217;s 194 device) to USER DIRECT on your A minidisk all you need to do now is run DIRECT USER DIRECT and you should be golden. There is no reason to run DMKFMT card deck unless you are generating a new VM and want to setup a new directory, spool, etc. When you log in to your new user you do need to use the CMS FORMAT 191 A command.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>15 Nov 2010 - VM/370, MySQL Cluster, Vagrant, VBox, Rails3, RVM</h2>

<p>Been playing around a lot with tech lately. Somehow I re-embroiled myself in implementing some solutions for a couple of small businesses over the last couple years. I guess it started with a friend that needed to recover an ancient intel/unix system from a crashed drive&#8230; So guess who was the only person in a large radius that had a clue?</p>

<p>Moving on&#8230; the great thing about open source is not that not much of it isreally &#8220;new&#8221;, heck I was doing half this stuff (conceptually) in the late 80&#8217;s on big iron. The more things change the more they are the same. The great thing is how cheap &#8220;big business solutions&#8221; are for small business. That and some of the tools are pretty amazing in terms of convenience. Vagrant/Chef has to be the best thing since sliced bread.</p>

<p>All of this playing around got me thinking. Why is it that some platforms/languages/tools generate so much devotion and some don&#8217;t. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I don&#8217;t mean popularity or market penetration, I mean that almost all the users of of <em>some</em> platforms/languages/tools are extreme Zelots vs. mere fans or users.</p>

<p>Multics, VM/CMS, Unix, C, emacs, and a few others seem to stick out as the former. I predict that ruby may become one of those few that have a Zelot like following even after it&#8217;s time has passed and it&#8217;s not &#8220;new&#8221; anymore. Who knows but I have the same feeling about it as I did for some of my other fond tech memories. We&#8217;ll see. Thinkng about some of the good ones got me so teary eyed that I fired up VM/370 over the weekend on <a href="http://www.hercules-390.org/">hercules</a> regen&#8217;d it and then got MVS/TSO, MVT, and a new gen of VM all running under it as virtual machines. Amazing. I even remember alot of 370 assembler. My Core i5 Macbook Pro sure blows the ol&#8217; 3083 into the weeds. It is amazing how efficient the big iron code is even in an emulator. I think the <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/mainframe/mainframe_PP3083.html">3083</a> is the first machine I worked on - that and a <a href="http://jack.hoaroots.org/b5900.htm">Burroughs B6900</a></p>

<p>More later.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sorry for leaving all of you Aperture users hanging for so long without a peep from me on all things Aperture 3.1 related. Also sorry to disappoint you with this post as I have nothing much to say about the upgrade&#8230; YET. I will tell you that I have had NO issues on any of my machines since upgrading and that from my perspective most people that have are probably not letting the upgrade process actually finish. It takes a while even though it&#8217;s hard to tell that it&#8217;s running - shame on Apple for not making this immediately apparent.</p>

<p>On to some other thoughts. As some of you know I am a huge fan of printing your photographs. One of the reasons that I have not disclosed is that I am actually a huge fan of paper. I love the visceral experience of it. In fact even though I have all of the modern devices that most of us have, I continue to use paper notebooks for most things. I go through them at a clip you probably wouldn&#8217;t believe. Part of it is just what I like and the other part of it actually has some practical side effects. I will describe those some other day. I pretty much jot everything that crosses my mind down, including just about every thing I think of to post here on this site. Of course I never get to most of them - that would take 4 lifetimes. Just like the reading list I accumulate in those same books. I write down project ideas, random aesthetic and political thoughts. Quotations I hear or read, news headlines that I find amusing. Everything.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/P1000761.jpg"></p>

<p>Be reassured that even though I have not posted on the site there are plenty of things that are on my &#8220;Blog posts&#8217; list. Today I just wanted to share a couple of quotes that I ran across in a book from about 2 years ago (yes I had to look something up). For your enjoyment here are a few I totally forgot&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><em>Avoid adjectives of scale. You will love the world more and desire it less.</em></blockquote>


<p>Matsuo Basho</p>

<blockquote><em>So&#8230; What you are saying is we (the USA) can torture to avoid catastrophes and we can cause catastrophes to avoid torture.</em></blockquote>


<p>Jon Stewart</p>

<blockquote><em>Interesting failures are much better than boring successes.</em></blockquote>


<p>Unk</p>

<blockquote><em>How much virtue is simply in seeing</em></blockquote>


<p>Thoreau</p>

<p>Thank goodness that nobody can clearly read my handwriting. Normal people would think I was insane with the mishmash of subject matter and context of my notes.</p>

<p>Have a great weekend.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My posts on how Aperture 3 RAW+JPEG works and how you can use it to speed up your work-flow sure generated a lot of feedback and questions via email. One question that I didn&#8217;t expect was how to get rid of your RAW files and keep just the JPEG after importing them as RAW+JPEG master pairs. I almost never do this, in fact I don&#8217;t import RAW files I don&#8217;t want. I did think that the question deserved a follow up post so here it is.</p>

<p>The short answer is that Aperture 3 provides no direct way of getting rid of either the RAW or JPEG individually if they were imported as a RAW+JPEG pair. That doesn&#8217;t mean that it can&#8217;t be done. I will walk you through how to do it real quick. One word of warning - this is probably not supported and not expected by Aperture but I can see no horrible side effects in my extensive testing while researching my file management eBook.</p>

<p>Assuming that you have RAW+JPEG pairs already imported and assuming you know a little bit about how Aperture file management works, I am going to start with managed files, get rid of just the raws and then end up with managed files again. Adjust to suit your needs. Here goes&#8230;</p>

<ol>
    <li>Mark the images that you want to get rid of the RAW component for the RAW+JPEG pair. You can use any method you like. Flags, create an album, ratings whatever. As long as it is easy to view just the target selection.</li>
    <li>View just those targeted images.</li>
    <li>Select all the images and use file-&gt;relocate masters to put all of the RAW and JPEG master files somewhere together and easy to find. Let&#8217;s pretend it is a folder called Desktop/blast RAW</li>
    <li>Use the finder to navigate to that folder. Search for all the RAW files, say .CR2 just in that folder via the finder search options.</li>
    <li>Drag the files to the trash. Empty the trash.</li>
    <li>Go back to Aperture, Select all the images again and use file-&gt;consolidate masters</li>
</ol>


<p>Done. Of course you can adjust the precise moving of masters around to suit your needs and organization but this works handily. You could of course use it to get rid of just the JPEG&#8217;s as well. After you do this if you did not have the master set properly to the file left behind (Photo-&gt;set JPEG master), this option still works but you obviously cannot set the master back to the file you got rid of. After doing this you can search till your heart is content and none of the files show up as missing or offline. In fact the only side effects seem to be that the &#8220;J&#8221; badge remains if you have it turned on indicating that there is also an &#8220;R&#8221; master but none of the master switching options are available. Second if you get rid of any of those JPEG image versions and empty the Aperture trash, Aperture will complain that there are missing master files. That&#8217;s it.</p>

<p>Hope this was helpful to those that asked the question.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just want to connect a couple of dots for a few readers out there. I know all of you hear about how wonderful shortcut keys are in speeding your work-flow along from me and others, sort of like motherhood and apple pie. Well I just wanted to give you a tiny little bite sized piece of Aperture 3 super simple stuff today to give you an example of why. This is a strange one but I caught myself doing it out of reflex and decided to put up a quick post so I don&#8217;t forget it.</p>

<p>As you know I love fullscreen mode for all of the reasons I already mentioned. I also love the on-the-fly UI adaptability of Aperture to suit the task at hand. The two go together so well when you use shortcut keys it is hard to explain except through examples. If mine don&#8217;t work out for you the point is find the ones that do.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Ap3meta.jpg"></p>

<p>So&#8230; when I am in fullscreen mode I like to see my images in all their glory (or not) undecorated with badges and metadata but in a lot of cases I like to know certain things about them as well. So what is one to do? Well for me I use both the view metadata overlays and the tooltips. I do this because I don&#8217;t like flipping back and forth between the inspector metadata tab and the adjustment tab. Too much wasted motion. Instead I turn on the extended view metadata overlays for some things and tool tips for others. To toggle between basic and extended view metadata use Shift-Y to show or hide whatever set is active use the Y key. Simple, fast, and effective.</p>

<p>For more detail I use the T key - typically while looking at the browser but also in the viewer. This toggle the annoying follow the mouse popup that displays metadata info for whatever image you are hovering over. I don&#8217;t leave it on, hit T get my info, hit T again to turn if off. After working this way it becomes reflex and takes NO time to think about or do. The real wonderful thing is that you can customize the info displayed by both of these features to be any thing you want. Just go to the view-&gt;metadata display-&gt;customize item in the menu (also available in the tools at the top of the screen in fullscreen mode)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know that all of you are wondering why it has been so very long since my last outburst on something photographic by calling bullshit out on something. Like interviews with photographers that talk incessantly about making every shot count and not taking too many images then at the end it comes up that he/she shot 30,000 images in less than a year to end up with 40 selects. Or a bogus horrendous magazine cover, etc.</p>

<p>Well, I have had quite a few fits but have not shared them. I think today I am going to have a short conversation regarding words from photographers that fall flat. They may be true but they just are plain bullshit coming from out of the mouths of particular photographers. Sort of like someone that has been rich since birth with not a monetary care in the world extolling the virtues of poverty. Ummm yea, okay.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s take David Allen Harvey. I&#8217;ll pick on him for a bit because he is actually one of my favorite photographers of all time. I love his work and have for decades. So do many many others. This guy&#8217;s entire career - the entire decade after decade, day after day, week after week, has been shooting and documenting what just about anyone of us reading this would consider EXOTIC locales and people. When he twitters that the best images are of humdrum, local surroundings, it kinda falls flat. Really? How come you spend 99.999999999999999% of your time traveling to hard to get to, hard to photograph, far far far far away places and take pictures of things other people can&#8217;t? Namely places where the indigenous population have never even seen a camera. (Hyperbole here).? Why is that Mr Harvey? I don&#8217;t think I have ever ever ever seen you publish or even display an image of where you actually live or ever lived. WTF?</p>

<p>Moving on to <a href="http://blog.leica-camera.com/interview/removing-the-veil-with-brigitte-lacombe/">this woman over on the Leica blog</a>. Hmmmmmmmmmmmm. The camera doesn&#8217;t matter&#8230; Well you might be right but what is the motivation that is driving you to shoot exclusively with a couple of $8000 cameras, and a bunch of lenses that cost $4000+ each? Well I guess they might matter a little to you. If not why wouldn&#8217;t you shoot with say a point and shoot. Oh and that is chump change compared to what she shoots commercial work with. WTF?</p>

<p>Being argumentative and paranoid I would have to think that because you do WAY different than you ostensibly &#8220;best advice&#8221; I would have to come to the conclusion that you are trying to sabotage unwitting folks into behavior that will not have a hope of competing with your livelihood.  No? Then please explain why you advise different than you do. Please, this is far more interesting than cliched bullshit that everyone says but doesn&#8217;t do. One more question Bridgette since you got me upset with your stupid crap cliche instead of educating me at all, what exactly do your colorful M9 images of traditional 3rd world women, doing traditional 3rd world housework, wearing traditional 3rd world dress have to do with the &#8220;work&#8221; the agency you are documenting to undo all that stuff? I do not get it?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have received a ton of questions regarding Aperture 3 color spaces over the last week or so. Been busy so I haven&#8217;t posted a whole lot - sorry. Anyway&#8230; I am going to try to answer a gaggle of questions, throwing some Apple specific tidbits, and hopefully give you a healthy dose of confidence regarding color in one fell swoop of Super Simple Stuff™.</p>

<p>First off - when processing RAW files Aperture uses what Apple refers to as a &#8220;internal super special wide gamut color space&#8221; for all image adjustments, manipulations, etc. They do not tell you what color space it is but from my experience it is perfectly fine to handle the native gamut of whatever RAW files I have ever thrown at it based on comparisons to testing in other software using ProPhoto color space. Bottom line - don&#8217;t worry about it. The only time a specific color space comes into play is when you export the image to a JPG or TIFF file and of course when you shoot it to an external editing program or plug-in. For those of you that need to make absolutely sure you are not &#8220;losing&#8221; color information on that export just setup up your export presets etc. to use something like ProPhoto. In reality Adobe RBG if usually bigger than required anyway.</p>

<p>Okay so for all of you that have no idea what I am talking about, I am going to give you a tool that may help you visualize why some people go nuts with this stuff. It is a visual tool that comes free with all Apple computers and is pretty amazing. I continue to forget that a lot of you are not long time Apple folk like me. The magic tool is called  &#8221;ColorSync Utility&#8221;. Just use spotlight to open it. Here is what it looks like.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cs1.jpg"></p>

<p>Now here is how to use it. First let&#8217;s look at our monitors space, just find the profile your display is  using at the left. If you calibrated your display use that profile instead of the generic one. You can drag the mouse around over the 3D graph to see all the sides of it.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cs2.jpg"></p>

<p>Next lets have some fun by comparing a simple little profile we all know and love like sRGB to our monitor. In the upper left of the 3D graph click the arrow and choose &#8220;hold for comparison&#8221;. Then find sRGB on the left and click on it  like so.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cs3.jpg"></p>

<p>Hmmmm. look at the overlay. I thought sRGB was &#8220;narrow&#8221;. Well it is my monitor can show more oranges, yellows, and greens than sRGB but less blues and purples. So what does this tell me? It tells me that my monitor cannot show all the colors even in sRGB. Let&#8217;s compare it to Adobe RGB by clicking on that. Remember - the display is the one that is &#8220;held for comparison&#8221;. Holy crap - my monitor doesn&#8217;t show anything. Well it&#8217;s a little better in the orange and yellow but man you gotta be kidding me.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cs4.jpg"></p>

<p>Next lets take a look at Adobe RGB vs. let&#8217;s say the blurb.com printing profile.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cs5.jpg"></p>

<p>Man - the printing gamut of those Indigo printers is REALLY SMALL, except for that turquoise area there. Maybe we should compare sRGB to the Indigo.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cs6.jpg"></p>

<p>Holy crap the indigo still can do that turquoise stuff better than either profile but sRGB is still way way way more color info everywhere else. Amazing. One last comparison, maybe our monitor to the Indigo.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cs7.jpg"></p>

<p>So&#8230; What does all this tell you. Well for one it tells you that adobe RGB is way bigger than my screen in representing color. sRGB is pretty close - weaker in some areas and bigger in others.  But more importantly my screen, sRGB, and Adobe RGB all have way more color info capability than can possibly be represented on Blurb.com Indigo printers, EXCEPT for the blue/green/turquoise area in which none of those three represent that well. Do I care? Sure I do if I actually have an image that has a lot of information and subtile tone differentiation in that hue/color area. Remember that the graph is representative NOT the actual colors - your monitor cannot even show them. In practice this kind of stuff is good to know but this should give you a good feel for understanding why I tell non-color-professionals to send files to printers in sRGB.</p>

<p>If you can&#8217;t see why let me lay it out. YOU CAN SEE sRGB for the most part, it is wider in most areas than a lot of commercial printers with some exceptions, and you don&#8217;t have to guess. Now that you can see how to know what is going on and what might happen with image color profile conversions in the output process and WHAT YOU CANNOT SEE with your own eyes on your own monitor this should give you a guide on when to worry about it and what you may want to do.</p>

<p>Trust me there is no magic bullet here yet. You actually have to KNOW THINGS. Just using the widest gamut possible is not a great idea. Especially if you don&#8217;t have a lot of experience at guessing results. It can actually be detrimental to you seeing issues with your own eyes on your monitor. Soft proofing using Aperture 3 or PS can give you a good idea for all the colors except where the printer is stronger in color representation than your monitor. You should know this to know what you are looking at. Where the blues and the greens are concerned in this case you have to think about the image that you are looking at to make an appropriate profile decision as well as what to do about areas that are not represented well.</p>

<p>I hope this actually helps you folks out with making progress on your digital color work. If it confused the crap out of you even more let me know, either way.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have always loved Aperture&#8217;s full screen mode. Clean, clear, uncluttered, easy to activate with the &#8220;F&#8221; key. What&#8217;s not to like. One of the best things about the new features introduced in Aperture 3 has not gotten a lot of press and that is all the new full screen functionality. The best of which happens to be the new full screen mode browser functionality. In the past full screen mode was a single image or couple of image affair. Now you can just about live inside Aperture full screen mode. You can do just about anything as long as you don&#8217;t need to access a menu item or fire up something that pops up a dialog. For me using shortcut keys, including some I added myself there is almost no need to ever leave the gorgeous luscious full screen interface with your photo library.</p>

<p>Here is a Aperture 3 super simple stuff walkthrough of how full screen mode works if you haven&#8217;t been living there already.</p>

<p>Of course you can enter fullscreen mode while working on a single image with the &#8220;F&#8221; key. Here is what mine looks like. I have the Inspector HUD docked using the little switch in the upper right corner of the the HUD. For the most part this is how I use it mainly for image adjustments. You can use it for metadata or the project inspector if you wish but I typically use other ways of doing that like the &#8220;T&#8221; key for the metadata tool tips and new features of the fullscreen browser for that stuff.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/FS-1-Adjustments.jpg"></p>

<p>Now the really good part. Just double click the full size image(s) that are displayed and viola, you are in the new and quite awesome fullscreen browser. Hooooo weee, this thing is sweet.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/FS-2-Browse.jpg"></p>

<p>But wait there&#8217;s more. See the condensed hierarchy summarized at the top telling you where you are in your organization structure. You can click to navigate up that chain. And wait just a minute, lo and behold, if you click and hold on any of the objects in that navigation line you can see all of the sub-objects that are contained under them. See why I don&#8217;t use the inspector HUD much?</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/FS-3-Navigate.jpg"></p>

<p>All of the stuff you know and love about the normal browser is at your disposal as well. Like searching. See&#8230;</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/FS-4-Search.jpg"></p>

<p>Of course if you don&#8217;t need the bird&#8217;s eye view of all your images and organization hierarchy there is the handy dandy film strip you can position wherever you want. I have  mine on the left side an switched to auto-hide/show so that it gets out of the way when I don&#8217;t need it. You can search till your heart&#8217;s content in the filmstrip to, see the search box and HUD icon at the top?</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/FS-5-Filmstrip.jpg"></p>

<p>Last but not least, all of your tools like lift and stamp, straiten, crop, etc are available as well. I also have this set to auto-hide/show. They are available in image viewer or browser mode in full screen. Nice.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/FS-6-Tools.jpg"></p>

<p>I hope this motivates you to explore the wonders of living in fullscreen mode a bit more if you haven&#8217;t been seduced already. It&#8217;s a god send on smaller screens like a laptop but to tell you the truth it works well no matter how large your screen is when you want to focus on your images and have all the other distractions out of the way.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hmmm, that was fast. An astute reader noticed that one of my screen shots in the Aperture 3 full screen mode post used the black point slider. It never ceases to amaze me that the questions that sort of thing generates are completely unpredictable to me. Her email wanted to know what that control did. I am going to answer that question here along with what I hope are the answers to a bunch of other questions that a lot of people have regarding Aperture&#8217;s adjustment controls. For that matter any image adjustments. I also hope to answer the &#8220;why&#8221; you might want to use one versus the other when choosing what adjustments to apply.</p>

<p>Before I begin keep this thought in mind. There are a million ways to get to the same place when adjusting an image. Choosing one over the other is more a matter of comfort and convenience rather than right and wrong. This is especially true of Aperture.</p>

<p>Okay let&#8217;s start with the exposure control block as a whole. For the most part the sliders are shortcuts to using something more complex like the curves control in Aperture. Meaning they manipulate the tonal values in much the same way you would do it using curves it&#8217;s just quicker and easier unless you want to do it some specific way or do other things that the sliders are not set up to do. I say this with one caveat - when I mention curves I am talking specifically about Aperture 3&#8217;s curves control and the new &#8220;extended&#8221; and &#8220;shadows&#8221; features.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s take an example - the black point control. This slider does two things if we want to talk about what it does in relation to a curve adjustment. The first thing it does is stick an anchor point somewhere in the mid tones to nail down the mids and highlights. The second is it moves the black point slider at the left towards the the right. In effect this makes the darks darker and increases shadow contrast if you move the black point slider to the right. I won&#8217;t really talk about moving it to the left because A) you almost never do it and B) although you can get close using the &#8220;shadows&#8221; range of the curves control it is WAY more difficult to get the same precision.</p>

<p>The other thing the black point slider does is makes extreme precision easier because the amount of movement of the slider vs the change is not a whole lot. If you are using curves in the &#8220;normal&#8221; range the tiny bit you have to move the black end is hard to do with the same precision. Hence that is sort of what the &#8220;shadows&#8221; range in the curves control does. Here is an image that get&#8217;s to the same place using both controls. The version on the right using black point at about &#8220;10&#8221; and the image on the right using a curves control.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/FS-adj.jpg"></p>

<p>Here is what the curves control looks like in the &#8220;shadows&#8221; range.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/FS-curve-1.jpg"></p>

<p>Here is what it looks like in the &#8220;normal&#8221; range. Note the anchor I stuck in the mid-tones.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/FS-curve-2.jpg"></p>

<p>The same is pretty much true for the rest of the exposure control block as well as the contrast slider in the enhance block. Think of them as shortcuts to doing things another way. Same goes for the recovery slider. It&#8217;s almost the reverse of black point. It sticks and anchor point in the lower mid tones and drags the right hand end point in curves further right in &#8220;extended&#8221; range. Contrast manipulates the end points in one direction or the other. You get it.</p>

<p>So why would you want to use anything but the sliders? Well, if you want something a little different than what they do. You want your anchor points in different places for different tones or you want to manipulate them in slightly different ways or maybe do a whole bunch of stuff with one control. Can you do a combination of both? Sure, let your eyes guide you, not some rigorous dogmatic by the numbers approach. Whatever works best for your purpose at the time, don&#8217;t sweat it too much.</p>

<p>Hope this helps - part of the Aperture super simple stuff series. Maybe I need a new series called &#8220;Aperture 3, fairly simple stuff&#8221;.</p>
