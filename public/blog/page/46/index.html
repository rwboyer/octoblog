  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/DSC_0292.jpg"><img title="DSC_0292.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.DSC_0292.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_0292.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="101" align="left" /></a>I have been having a couple of conversations with various e-buddies about laziness, inspiration, cameras, film, and just getting off my ass to make some images. One of the reasons that I don&#8217;t do much commercial work any more is that it is so easy to become jaded with photography. Once you feel that you can make a picture of anything anytime you want because you have to it is easy to slip into a place where you have no desire to.</p>

<p>Over the last week or so I have been making and effort to go out and make at least one reasonable image every day. Even if it is in my own neighborhood. You know what? I have had a blast doing it. No schedule, no production planning, no models to deal with. Just me an whatever camera I feel like grabbing. Taking a walk is nice, being outside in June here is nice and I am actually doing scenics - I am not a landscape guy. I am going to do my best to make a reasonable image every day.</p>

<p>If I can keep it up and really make a commitment to it I am thinking about starting a little flickr group for all of us here that are interested in each others images and hoping to get some others off of their collective butts and photograph their neighborhood and local surroundings in new and different ways every day. Along with some group sharing, therapy, and collective motivation, I have also discussed an open, honest, critique group. Let me know who might be interested. I may make it private to keep out the riffraff, we&#8217;ll see.</p>

<p>Now to the real topic of this post. I happened to be out shooting a couple of images of my little neighborhood harbor last evening and saw the light/atmospheric effects in the image at the top of the post. Barely visible to the naked eye or casual observer but I saw it. I cranked up some various color filters and boosted contrast to make it pop in this black and white conversion. I have never seen anything like this. No it&#8217;s not &#8220;god rays&#8221; of the sun coming down through the clouds and lighting up mist. No it&#8217;s not photoshopped in. Think about this for a moment. This is at dusk and the sun is at the horizon almost directly BEHIND me NOT in front of me. and the rays seem to be emanating from the far horizon.</p>

<p>Anybody know what the heck this is? What causes it?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not some weird lens thing going on - I have torture tested this lens trying to get it to do strange flare-y stuff and strange aperture stuff in all manner of conditions for years AND I saw the effect with my eyes too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2001_042_05.jpg"><img title="2001_042_05.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.2001_042_05.jpg" border="0" alt="2001_042_05.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="102" align="left" /></a>When I was shooting film for everything I almost never got rid of any negatives. A combination of both irrational reasons as well as rational reasons combined to make me keep everything I shot. From a rational point of view if I was shooting roll film It was more trouble to cut individual negatives out of the strip rather than just filing the whole thing. For sheet film if there were technical faults or aesthetic faults I would make notes on what went wrong for educational purposes - mine mostly.</p>

<p>As time wore on and I made it a practice of reviewing contact sheets of things that I had shot years previously a few things occurred to me over and over again. The first thing was that a lot of the &#8220;faults&#8221; are not more than a passing stylistic fancy that you happen to have at a certain point in time. Second, other more technical faults are either irrelevant for a particular image or are so secondary to the image that you don&#8217;t really care about them down the road. Third, images that you may have decided are superior for inane reasons, like they are sharper or have no subject motion, are not nearly as good as the one right next to it that happens to have a little subject motion. This can be true of any image I guess but I have found it especially true of people.</p>

<p>Case in point. When I first shot the images included with this post of my 3 year old daughter I knew that they were not going to be great due to the fact that I grabbed my camera that was loaded with<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2001_042_10.jpg"><img title="2001_042_10.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.2001_042_10.jpg" border="0" alt="2001_042_10.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="102" align="right" /></a>Kodak Plus-X film and just started shooting. Plus-X is ISO 125 at best and this was an indoor shot of an animated 3 year old. As I fired off a couple of shots I &#8220;knew&#8221; there was going to be subject movement given that I was shooting at 1/30. I developed the film in PMK Pyro because all of the other exposures on that roll were perfectly exposed for that developer. The first prints that I made did not include these two. In fact they included none of the 5 shots in this series because what I &#8220;knew&#8221; was true - there was a ton of motion blur.</p>

<p>Years later when I was going through contact sheets I decided to print these two images. Turns out I like them way more than my other perfect images on this roll. Heck I forget where the original prints that I made of &#8220;perfect&#8221; frames are.</p>

<p>I guess my point here with digital is that I am still an image pack-rat and almost never get rid of images. I get rid of images that I take for e-bay auctions and such but almost never delete anything that has people in them. Especially people that I care about. I know there are two schools of thought on this but given that storage is small and cheap why not keep them?</p>

<p>My advise is to leave the things alone - at least for a couple of years.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/DSC_0267.jpg"><img title="DSC_0267.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.DSC_0267.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_0267.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="101" align="left" /></a>Seems that my mini-review of Nik Silver Efex for Aperture sparked a mild amount of interest from a couple of people that haven&#8217;t done a whole lot of black and white conversions to date, are interested in the Silver Efex plug-in and wanted a little bit more info.Of course they pointed out the flaws in my quick and dirty review of the software. One guy even asked if I ever shoot any thing that I have to walk more than 10 feet from my desk to shoot. He was kidding (I hope).</p>

<p>The consensus question was if it was worth the cash. I really hate to make those kind of value judgements for other people, the variables are so different for everyone. I will weigh in on the &#8220;worth it&#8221; just a little bit for Silver Efex Pro only because it is a non-trivial investment and it has some pretty narrow functionality compared to say a Photoshop CS4 or Lightroom or Aperture 2. My opinion is that it is worth it if you use it. Use meaning a lot of things. I will rephrase a couple of things from my <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2009/06/aperture-plug-in-mini-review-nik-silver-efex-pro-30/">original review</a> to be clear. If you like black and white photography but the software you are using it not cutting it then Silver Efex is probably worth the money. If you do a heck of a lot of black and white and Silver Efex could save you a lot of time then it is worth the money. I did say that it was the best black and white conversion software that I have ever used. I bought it and I was quite satisfied with using all of the bag of tricks in Photoshop that I have developed over the years. Then again I am a nut.</p>

<p>I guess you should try it - Nik does have a <a href="http://www.niksoftware.com/silverefexpro/usa/entry.php">free trial version</a>. See what you think. If you like black and white but rather shoot digital and not mess around with film and a darkroom you should definitely do the free trial. Like all of the Nik software this has some depth and deserves some dedicated time behind the wheel rather than a couple of clicks here and there so start the eval when you will have time to do it justice.</p>

<p>The bigger flaw that a few people pointed out was that they had a hard time visualizing what I<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/DSC_0267__2_.jpg"><img title="DSC_0267__2_.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.DSC_0267__2_.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_0267__2_.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="101" align="right" /></a>started with for the image that I included with the review. I apologize for that, looking back on it I was stupid not to include the starting color digital image so here it is. Not only that but you can have the whole RAW NEF file as well so you can examine the color, black and white versions that Aperture does as well as what Nik can do in all of the glorious 100% detail if you want. You can even take a look at the strange 12-24 lens distortion if you want and see how the brand spanking new Nikon Capture NX2 automatically knows how to correct it based on a database of Nikon lenses included with it. You gotta love NX2 sometimes. Obviously I didn&#8217;t use NX2 for this conversion.</p>

<p>[download#9]</p>

<p>I even went way out of my way, walked out my front door, across a dirt road, and through some grass to make this image for all of you today. I guess that was about 150 feet. Have fun.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. What would really be fun is to see some reader black and white interpretations of the same image. I will bet dollars to doughnuts that they will be different than mine.</p>

Way out of production Polapan black and white slide film. As far as I know this was only available as an instant 35mm film that you shot and then processed &#8220;instantly&#8221; in a little machine that you could by from Polaroid. The little machine was pretty cool and could process all of the other Polaroid 35mm slide films as well. You had to crank a little handle at a specific speed, not to fast, not too slow.</p>

<p>This film was basically useless prior to digital film scanning and obsolete as soon as it became even a little useful. Virtually impossible to print well prior to digital output. Extremely strange almost surreal look and odd tonal response. Not sharp, very soft grain, but here it is a 4000 DPI in all it&#8217;s glory.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2001_599_01.jpg"><img class="alignright" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 10px;" title="2001_599_01.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.2001_599_01.jpg" border="0" alt="2001_599_01.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="102" height="150" align="left" /></a></p>

<p>Worst case it may giive you some visual ideas for beating your digital into submission for a project that calls for something a bit off the beaten path.</p>

<p>On another note the image at the top of the post is Polapan slide film on a lightbox rendered in pretty much absolutely perfect color (true to life) thanks to the wonders of the modern digicam, RAW files, and the ability to really really get accurate color temperature today.</p>

<p>and how about that at 100% as in looking at it under a microscope.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2001_599_01___Version_2.jpg"><img title="2001_599_01___Version_2.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.2001_599_01___Version_2.jpg" border="0" alt="2001_599_01___Version_2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/DSC_9879.jpg"><img title="DSC_9879.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.DSC_9879.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_9879.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="101" align="left" /></a>Quick update. Just took delivery via FedEx of a brand new MacBook Pro 15 yesterday morning. I have not been this happy with a new machine since my PowerBook G4 Ti in 2001 or maybe my dual 1.42 Ghz PowerMac G4 with 2 GB of RAM in 2002. Of course I have had the consistent march of ever more powerful machines. I was happy with my PowerMac G5 (solo) and my PowerBook G4 Al 1.25 Ghz with 2 GB but they were incremental and gave me a little bit more of the same. The 2001 PowerBook was like nothing else out there from every point of view - a quantum leap. Same with the PowerMac G4 dual and 2 GB (compared with the machine it replaced).</p>

<p>I was happy with my PowerBook Al, My first MacBook Pro 15 was of the first generation Core 2 variety. Maxed out at 3 GB and was really not that much better than my PowerBook. The build quality was off compared to the PowerBook and I really never warmed up to it. I should have splurged and upgraded the graphics. Well it started getting a little flakey last week, probably the HD. I will fix that and give it to somebody in the family or keep it in my stock pile of Macs dedicated to being annexed by my next girl friend or something.</p>

<p>I have really liked the new unibody MacBook Pro&#8217;s from a build quality standpoint but couldn&#8217;t really justify spending the money to replace a 2 year old laptop just for build quality. Well the new pricing and spec bumps announced recently combined with the flaking out of my older Core 2 hard drive - WTF - I fired up the old credit card and hit the buy button in the online Apple Store.</p>

<p>I am now the proud owner of a new unibody 15&#8221; MacBook Pro 2.8 Ghz 8 GB RAM (finally) and the good graphics (512 MB). This thing is fantastic, that battery really does last 7+ hours. It is way way way way faster than my last MBP, in fact I think it may even smoke my 1st gen MacPro quad core in some very common things. I have done any scientific testing yet but Aperture screams, and CS4 is unbelievable with my 4000DPI 16bit medium format scans (a single layer file is over half a GB). This really is the first laptop that I have had that I have been blown away by since my 2001 PB G4 Ti. Oh and the build quality is fantastic - the bar has been raised.</p>

<p>Recommendation - If you are in need of a new laptop the new top of the line 15 with 512 MB VRAM and the 500 GB harddrive is the ticket - especially with the lower price. I am an idiot and have been wanting a laptop with serious RAM for a long time so I jammed the 8 GB in there. This is totally irrational and would not recommend this for non-idiots until the 2 GB chips come down in price. Find yourself a student get the stock model for about $2100 and be very very happy.</p>

I still prefer making black and white photographs in both the traditional silver process, digital, and hybrid approaches. Having fessed up to that I will also disclose that I have tried just about every digital black and white product known to mankind. Honestly I have never been really impressed with any of them above and beyond what I can do with plain old Adobe Photoshop and would probably not recommend any of them to anybody. Nik Silver Efex Pro 3.0 is probably the best digital black and white converter that I have owned used or tried and I can recommend it to some people.</p>

<p>I will get to the bottom line really quick and follow-up with a couple of more detailed thoughts. I can do anything that Silver Efex Pro 3.0 can do in plain old Photoshop. The only exception may be the Nik grain engine. That being said if you have been doing digital black and white conversions for a long time and understand what you are going for and how to Â get there in Photoshop there is nothing that is going to knock your socks off about Silver Efex Pro that would cause you to want it. The only exception as I mentioned is if you have the black and white conversion thing exactly where you want it in Photoshop but have been searching for a decent way to simulate film grain.<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/screen_capture_8.jpg"><img title="screen_capture_8.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.screen_capture_8.jpg" border="0" alt="screen_capture_8.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="94" align="left" /></a></p>

<p>On the other hand if you love black and white but have no idea how to get the results that you want in Photoshop or rather not use Photoshop in your work-flow Silver Efex Pro may be just the ticket. You can get fantastic results extremely fast with no fuss. If you are familiar with the Nik control point way of making local adjustments and masks, local adjustments are a breeze. They work just like they work in other Nik products like Viveza or Capture NX2. You can set up presets that combine everything that Silver Efex can do to speed up your workflow even more.</p>

<p>Going through some of the features in a little bit more detail along with some random thoughts and opinions let&#8217;s start over on the right hand side, this is where all of the image controls live. First off you have brightness, contrast, and structure sliders. The first two are pretty much selfÂ explanatory. The structure control deserves a little moreÂ explanation. This control is a very fine tuned local contrast control that is perfectly suited to dealing with black and white tonal ranges. While you can accomplish the same results in Photoshop if you have no idea how you might go nuts with a million different curves, masks and other localÂ adjustments to get the same effects of what the structure control does just by sliding it back and forth. This is one of the high points of Silver Efex, especially if you are struggling with Photoshop adjustments to get some of the same effects. Fantastic.</p>

<p>Next come the control points for localized adjustments and the highlights/shadows protection controls that are typical of all Nik software - if you don&#8217;t know what they do visit Nik&#8217;s site, it&#8217;s pretty much all they talk about. Extremely quick, easy, and effective. I wish Aperture would adopt something like this build in to Aperture.</p>

<p>After that are the color filters, these are typical of virtually every black and white conversion tool out there. Nik&#8217;s twist on them is each filter has a color and strength fine tuning slider. The controls are a little different but accomplish the same thing as everything else out there - channel mixers, etc. No need to dwell on them.</p>

<p>After the color filter controls comes the film types block. This is an attempt to simulate various brands Â and speeds of actual black and white films that have been on the market over the years. Simulation of actual black and white films are nothing new or exclusive to Nik Silver Efex and I have to say the attributes that Nik attempts to simulate are pretty comprehensive but I find them more an amusement than anÂ indispensableÂ finely tuned tool. You may feel differently. The Silver Efex Pro film types attempt to simulate characteristic curves, grain, and spectral response of each film type. This deserves a little bit of anÂ explanationÂ for those not super familiar with actual black and white film.</p>

<p>Each black and white film has a unique spectral response in terms of the way it sees colors. some films see blue a little more than they see green, etc. These spectral response differences with real black and white films are subtle but noticeable in various situations. In the real world you have to be pretty familiar with various films with similar subjects to notice any spectral response differences between them. Add a colored filter and the spectral response differences between films is overwhelmed by the colored filter. The same thing holds true for tonal response curves or how a particular film responds to various exposure values. TXP (TRI-X PRO 320) is vastly different than regular TX (TRI-X 400). While they are important in getting to know a particular film if you are shooting real film the differences are overwhelmed when you start manipulating the contrast curves in other ways. Â The grain simulator is preset set for each film type in sort of a caricature sort of way that may serve as a starting point for some of the various film type simulations but is in no way the end all be all of what that particular film looks like in reality.</p>

<p>I guess my issue with the film type simulations all boils down to the way the characteristic curves are handled within the film type simulation. The characteristic curves do not appear to be characteristic curves of the various films developed to the same CI (overall contrast index), they seem to be combined with completely different CI&#8217;s from film type to film type. In effect you get a film types characteristic curve AND a ONE particular way of developing that film combined into one, each simulation again being aÂ caricatureÂ the &#8220;guy on the street&#8217;s&#8221; impression of a particular film.Â </p>

<p>The film grain simulation is by far the best I have ever seen. At first glance it really does give the impression of the way real film grain looks. It does have some short comings. The first one is the biggest deal with simulating real film grain. With real film grain seems random in areas with no detail and then some how seems to magically line itself up and form specific patterns to reproduce details that seem smaller than the film grains in highly detailed areas of the image. If you have ever looked at film under high magnification this is clear and is the biggest reason most grain simulators look like absolute crap compared to real film grain. When I first looked at the Nik simulated film grain I thought that this was nailed. Upon closer inspection it is not. Maybe Nik does do something different in areas with a lot of detail but it does not nail the way real film grain works. Maybe in the next version.</p>

<p>The second and more minor issue that I have with the grain simulator is the way that you control it. A slider for &#8220;grains per pixel&#8221; and a slider to control hardness/softness of the grain. Depending on how you plan to use your final images this seems like the wrong way to control a grain simulation to me for an image that starts out with no grain and you can put out at arbitrary sizes. For example If I shoot with TRI-X and push it to 1600 shot on 5x4 film and then print an 8x10 print you would never even see the grain. How come when I choose the TRI-X film simulation I get what a super grainy pushed TRI-X 35mm blown up to 11x14 would look like no matter what the resolution of the camera I am using even at tiny web display sizes. Conversely if you send a 6 Megapixel image in it looks completely different than if you send a 25 Megapixel image in. What this all adds up to is the grain engine is difficult to nail down with any degree ofÂ repeatabilityÂ depending on your output sizes and intent. It needs a better UI to specify what it should be doing. Especially if you are going to use it as a preset across multiple output intents and cameras.</p>

<p>After the film types are the stylizing controls. You can simulate various traditional print toning methods, addÂ vignettes, and add edge burning effects. Again nothing new under the sun here but quick easy and effective. Not much to talk about here, maybe a mention that each of these controls hasÂ enormousÂ flexibility and range.</p>

<p>The last thing I will mention is something that seems like a small thing but it is actually m <a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/screen_capture_9.jpg"><img title="screen_capture_9.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.screen_capture_9.jpg" border="0" alt="screen_capture_9.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="94" align="right" /></a>favorite feature of Silver Efex. The little Zone viewer all of the way at the bottom of the left hand side. This little thing is a god send if you do any printing. Even with a ton of practice it is still really easy to get an image that looks great on screen but looks like crap on paper. The huge 1000:1 contrast range of your typical high quality LCD monitor tricks your eyes very easily. Tones that are easy toÂ differentiateÂ with full detail at the high and low end of the tonal range will not do the same thing with ink on paper at more like 100:1 contrast ratio. The little zone system tool works a couple of ways. If you hover your mouse over a particular zone it shows you all of the tones in the image that are in that range. If you click on one of the little zone patches the overlay stays on the image. This makes it easy to make adjustments while keeping things in ranges that will look great on paper. Very cool.</p>

<p>Nik&#8217;s packaging and pricing structure for various products continue to be a mystery to me. No advice here but if you do choose to by one of the various versions for Photoshop, the whole shebang pack (except no SFX for NX2) or just the lowly Aperture version do me a favor and use the Amazon link on the site.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2000_067_15_full.jpg"><img title="2000_067_15_full.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.2000_067_15_full.jpg" border="0" alt="2000_067_15_full.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="102" height="150" align="left" /></a>I have put a number of posts in the &#8220;shooting film&#8221; series. By a large margin the posts that have generated the most questions and correspondence have been the couple of films that I have posted so far that have been developed in pyro. If memory serves, I believe that the only two have been Ilford HP5 plus in PMK pyro and Kodak Plus-X also developed in PMK pyro. The Plus-X wasn&#8217;t even in the shooting film series - It was in the a random rant about &#8220;80% of what you read or hear is nonsense&#8221; post.</p>

<p>To answer a whole category of questions in one fell swoop - Yes I like pyro developers and have found PMK to be very consistent. Yes I do think that some pyro developers have some unique properties that act differently than other developers on a particular film. Yes I am will be glad to post some more films/pyro developer combinations. No I am not going to post specific development times/temps/agitations etc. Not because I am stingy, it just goes against my philosophy what is valuable and what is not. I will be glad to write a little bit more about some general findings regarding dilutions, etc.. If anyone is having an issue or has a very specific question regarding film development, email me and I will be glad to share specific experiences and opinions with you.</p>

<p>I guess I confused a lot of people with what appear to be contradictory posts regarding pyro based developers. In the post on <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2009/06/shooting-film-ilford-hp5-plus/">Ilford HP5 plus and PMK pyro</a> I said that the combination is one of my favorites and has some very special properties that make it useful and beautiful even though HP5 plus is not one of my favorite films overall. In fact it is not my favorite film for pyro development either. In the <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2009/06/80-of-everything-you-read-about-photography-is-complete-nonsense/">80% of everything is nonsense post</a> I used an example of two very different films in two very different developers, one being PMK pyro, both calibrated to show how similar the results were. Both sets of comments are absolutely true and completely independent. The point I was trying to make but came off looking like I did not thing PMK was worthwhile was that a lot of information and observations out there regarding a film/developer/etc. are anecdotal with no control over the variables. For instance person #1 uses film A and developer B, then tries something else completely. Different film, different developer, different scene, some random processing times/temps/methods and likes the result &#8220;better&#8221; than what he was getting before. Wow now there is some great and useful information (not). This is the kind of stuff that gets communicated most of the time. Even by professional photographers. Useless.<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2000_067_15.jpg"><img title="2000_067_15.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.2000_067_15.jpg" border="0" alt="2000_067_15.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="144" height="150" align="right" /></a></p>

<p>Hope that clears things up. Oh one other thing - Yes I shoot Tri-X, in fact Tri-X is probably my desert island film. I will get around to posting some experiences with it and some samples using various developers as well - that might take a few posts to the shooting film series.</p>

<p>On a final note just to reinforce that you need to try things on your own, make your own judgements. The images included in this post are probably one of the least likely combinations of film and film developer that you will find. I kind of remember a lot of people who &#8220;knew&#8221; what they were talking about recommending against it way back in the day. To be fair my first couple of tries and guesses were a disaster. I figured out what I thought went way wrong, made some corrections, tried again, lather, rinse, repeat. Long story short this is TMAX 3200P (TMZ) shot at ISO 3200 developed in PMK pyro. No shit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/DSC_0207.jpg"><img title="DSC_0207.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.DSC_0207.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_0207.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="101" align="left" /></a>Like most other people that publish a website either for business, pleasure, or creative outlet I monitor where visitors to the site come from. If this were a commercial site I would do this to fine tune what is making me money. I look at where visitors come from and how they ended up here for amusement, satisfaction of my curiosity, and every once in a while to assess what kind of posts I might publish based on keywords that people use to get here.</p>

<p>Some keywords are really useful to guide me in what I hope to be useful information like &#8220;aperture organization&#8221;, &#8220;aperture file management&#8221;, &#8220;lightroom vs aperture&#8221;, etc. The more specific the topic the more useful it is to figure out what may be helpful to readers from an outsiders perspective. A great example from the past is &#8220;do I need gels when shooting raw&#8221;. Some keyword searches are perplex me, amuse me to see what people type into google, and some I will just not ever address because I wouldn&#8217;t know where to start. I really loved &#8220;how the hell does aperture work i am really mad and confused&#8221; - that is so different than anything I would ever type into a google search it&#8217;s funny.<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/DSC_0196.jpg"><img title="DSC_0196.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.DSC_0196.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_0196.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="101" align="right" /></a></p>

<p>At this point I doubt you are wondering where the title for this post came from. &#8220;Ansel Adams Lightroom presets&#8221; were search terms used to get to this site. The first couple of times that I saw them I thought to myself &#8220;what could this person actually want?&#8221;. The big surprise is that I have seen these keywords pop up a couple of times every day for about a year. I really do not know what to do with them. Should I make fun of them? Maybe some sarcastic humor like my fine art lesson? Or should I take them seriously and actually try to deal with satisfying the &#8220;need&#8221;. Wait maybe I should put up a a bunch of before and after images and sell an actual &#8220;Ansel Adams Lightroom preset&#8221; for $39.95 or something?</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/DSC_8004.jpg"><img title="DSC_8004.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.DSC_8004.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_8004.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="99" align="left" /></a>Ansel Adams did a fantastic job codifying his process of controls in the zone system and made some wonderful landscape images. Nothing really new, just codified. What he didn&#8217;t do is do a good job of putting the whole thing together in terms of treatment of a specific image. He also was the worlds worst portrait photographer - especially in color.</p>

<p>I would love to hear input on what people searching for an &#8220;Ansel Adams Lightroom preset&#8221; actually want. An HDR lesson in getting lots of detail on the &#8220;negative&#8221;?, manipulating overall &#8220;print&#8221; contrast? or most importantly localized exposure adjustments for the final &#8220;print&#8221;? Anyone know where the heck to start with this? How about where to start in the context of a &#8220;Lightroom preset&#8221;?</p>

A little background for those not familiar with Polaroid materials. I never really shot Polaroid materials as my primary medium. Some people have made a career out of it. Most of us old-timers did use it to check lighting and confirm everything was just right before letting it rip. After seening someone or other&#8217;s gallery show done entirely using Poloaroid Type 55 I decided to give it a try and used it as my proofing and test shots from then on out. Here is why.</p>

<p>Most Polaroid films give you a single print and a big gooey mess that you can use if you want to roll it onto another piece of paper - aka a Polaroid transfer - sort of. Type 55 and Type 665 give you a positive AND a negative, all you need to do to develop the real honest to goodness negative is dip it in a sodium sulfite bath and give it a rinse. This was pretty cool, the negatives had a unique look and every once in a while I shot them purely for effect. Every once in a while I ended up liking some of my first few proofs better than the other 20 shots that I made for the set and used one of the proof negatives as the final. Nice.<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2001_665_01.jpg"><img title="2001_665_01.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.2001_665_01.jpg" border="0" alt="2001_665_01.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="120" align="right" /></a></p>

<p>If you ever get a chance to play with this stuff it is a blast, has a look so unique and coveted that there are a bunch of fine art people that hoard this stuff and charge big money to shoot it on commission or save it for only the work they are sure about. I cannot believe someone hasn&#8217;t bought the license and started producing it yet. This stuff is bringing like $50 for a 10 exposure pack on eBay and elsewhere. If you do stumble across some be careful. If the sheets of material are stuck together at all inside the pack and you pull the tab and it doesn&#8217;t come out you are toast and there goes your $50. I do know some devotees actually take the old packs a apart in the dark and un-stick everything to make sure before shooting older stuff.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. I still have a couple of boxes of this stuff left, it really does have a unique rendering as you can clearly see through the dust and scratches on the 100% crop (Don&#8217;t ask - long story, I am usually a clean freak when it comes to negatives) I am sort of scared to shoot the stuff - anyone out there have any idea on what the recent state of affairs is with someone making 665 again?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/1999011_04.jpg"><img title="1999011_04.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/.thumbs/.1999011_04.jpg" border="0" alt="1999011_04.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="102" height="150" align="left" /></a>For the longest time that I can remember when I shot 35mm film it was either Kodachrome 64 or Kodachrome 200. A couple of paying jobs, some stuff for stock photography, a lot of travel, and all of my personal color photos where on just two types of Kodachrome. It was either that or black and white.</p>

<p>By todays standards it is a farily low saturation film, heck by the late 80&#8217;s it was a low saturated film. I knew it, never ever had a color issues with it, and the shots I took 30 years ago look exactly the same as they ever have. The cool thing about Kodachrome is even though it was low saturation (not really just by today&#8217;s idiotically cartoonish color standards) it had a way of making certain shades of red really pop compared to neutrals or other colors in the scene. I never shot Kodachrome in any format other than 35mm and would say that out of all the 35mm that I did shoot about 30% was color and 70% was black and white.</p>

<p>I do admit that I did test and then move to Kodak E100S and E100SW when it became available and shot it both in 35mm as well as medium format. I never shot color in large format. So here it is Kodakchrome 64 in all it&#8217;s glory, no sharpening, no color or contrast adjustments, just a plain old 4000 DPI scan at 4000 DPI. Not bad for a 1970&#8217;s and 80&#8217;s film whose basic technology is 50 years old. This slide is about 20 years old.</p>

<p>Nikon F2AS 85mm F1.4 shot wide open at 1/125. Check out the lack of depth of field between the paint brush and the eye.</p>
