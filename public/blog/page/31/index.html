  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/DSC_0145.jpg"><img title="DSC_0145.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/.thumbs/.DSC_0145.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_0145.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="101" align="left" /></a>I never worried about hurting my gear too much. I am not saying that I beat it up on purpose or was careless with any of it. I treat it with respect. That being said I am going to give you some advice on making better pictures as well as a case to use you biggest piece of crap camera to do it.</p>

<p>I was prompted to post this after listening to a recent Lenswork podcast about this topic - the speaker regrets not taking some pictures as recently as yesterday for fear of breaking his camera. I agree with his philosophy to stop thinking that way - I disagree that he has any good ideas on how to stop thinking that way considering he obviously reacts to favor camera protection over images when actually in the situation.</p>

<p>I am not trying to come off as someone that does not care about his gear - I do. If I lost a camera or dropped it into the ocean before actually taking a picture I would go berserk but I have never broken a camera due to environmental conditions actually taking pictures. I used to worry about this, even subconsciously but I have gotten over it. How did I do it? Well first off I have always gravitated toward the pro end of the camera line in whatever I was shooting - usually not for &#8220;features&#8221; more for other reasons. I have kept most of my gear even after I upgrade. So after a couple of upgrade cycles I had what I considered &#8220;beater&#8221; cameras. Guess what - Every beater camera that I have ever owned still functions like new - they still even look good and these were my cameras that I put in harms way on PURPOSE. So after a while I stopped being shy at all with my new cameras of the same calibre - it just happened without putting much thought into it.</p>

<p>So here is what you should try on purpose - even if you don&#8217;t expect to run into lousy conditions. Take your beater camera out with you. See if it breaks - be more brazen. Subject it to just about any circumstance that you will subject yourself to - try to break it. I don&#8217;t mean be destructive like throwing it down on the sidewalk or anything. Just go shoot - if it don&#8217;t break you it&#8217;s not likely to break the camera. I bet you will make more interesting pictures and gain some unexpected psychological freedom in the process. You may find you even like your beater camera because of the freedom better than your main squeeze. Reminds me of an old Range Rover that my family owned - my brother and I loved that beast.</p>

<p>My current beaters are my Nikon D2Hs and my Nikon D200&#8217;s. I don&#8217;t think I could kill these things if I did try. The D2Hs have over 100K exposures on them. Amazing. I don&#8217;t worry too much about the D3 either. The shot at the top was taken immediately after myself and my camera getting deluged while rafting over to a nearby island. Just wanted to make sure that it was working for images I wanted to take later in the day.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/DSC_9372___NX2_Landscape.jpg"><img title="DSC_9372___NX2_Landscape.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/.thumbs/.DSC_9372___NX2_Landscape.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_9372___NX2_Landscape.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="101" align="left" /></a>Here is a short little video for those of you wanting to develop your own presets for NEF files in Aperture 3 that are closer to the way Capture NX2 renders your RAW files. I will continue to work on the cameras that I do not own as I get a decent sampling of images. So far a couple of people have sent me files - but a lot of people have requested presets. I am in need of additional samples for the D700, D300s, D3s, and D3x. If you have a lower end camera like a D5000 I need those as well. I have a couple but not really enough range to nail it.</p>

<p>This screencast is about color - not all of the colors just two. They are to give you some ideas not a formula. The secret is starting at the right hue and/or using the range slider to make your preset applicable to all your NEF files - not just one. The real issue comes in on some Nikon camera RAW files that render greens so yellow and yellows so green that they do not separate. The other real issue is depending on the original tone - things that are the same hue in NX2 are different hues in Aperture - for the most part this can be overcome. The culprit in Aperture 3 seems to be the hue boost slider in RAW fine tuning - it makes some things way worse like the blues while making other things better. Some cameras the default is all the way up (not good - this causes the yellow/green merging issue) while other cameras the default is in the middle.</p>

<p>In addition to color there are various brightness and contrast issues that vary wildly from camera to camera. If you are interested in dealing with those as well I will post another screencast. Let me know. By and large if you get the hues corrected the various renderings are a matter of matching the contrast curve and saturation. Last but not least the sharpening in NX2 is more aggressive for each Picture Control except for Portrait and Neutral. You can deal with these via definition and edge sharpening.</p>

<p>One note while you are watching this - Hue is what we are fixing in this video NOT saturation. Hue is the actual color. The saturation differences usually go away when I fix the overall brightness, contrast, and saturation. If there are specific color groups that are relatively more or less saturated I deal with them after the global adjustments. If you are new to looking at color you can sometimes get &#8220;tricked&#8221; into thinking a color is different just because of more or less saturation or even brightness - technically the &#8220;color&#8221; is different but the hue is the same - the hue is the biggest issue with NEF&#8217;s the other stuff is no big deal.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Ap3CA.jpg"><img title="Ap3CA.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/.thumbs/.Ap3CA.jpg" border="0" alt="Ap3CA.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="92" align="left" /></a>Tested this out over the last few days - not that my lenses have a lot of CA but the new adjustment is really really simple and extremely effective. One of the only lenses that I have in current use that has any visible chromatic aberration is my Nikon 12-24 AFS and then it has the most at 12mm. I just wanted to throw up an example of how good this new adjustment is. Of course the Nikon Capture NX2 adjustment is just as good - actually maybe even better technically but I cannot see the difference with this lens. The nice thing about NX2 is the automatic application of the correction based on lens data - just like distortion.</p>

<p>With Aperture 3 the best bet is just to make a few presets for the lenses you use - not a big deal since you can search by lens and batch apply the preset. No need to do it manually all the time. Check out the screenshot at the top - on the left is with the correction. On the right w/o. If you do not know what to look for look at the edge of the hull against the sky and the chrome against the sky - it is well hidden because it is the cyan variety but I think it is a night and day difference.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The good news is so far the local adjustments are proving extremely useable. I have been testing a lot of creative local adjustments and ways of going about doing things given the combination of tools Aperture has available for my upcoming Adjustment eBook.</p>

<p>The bad news in case you were wondering is that even though you can save brush adjustments as a preset they are only useful on images of the same dimensions - there appears to be no way to make them &#8220;relative&#8221; they are absolute - so&#8230; the utility of a &#8220;creative border treatment preset&#8221; as described in the Aperture marketing literature seems to be not so practical in the real world of multi-cameras and crops.</p>

<p>As this is early in the Aperture 3 release cycle this could be wrong - considering that a friend of mine has been able to provoke the book tool to provide font transparency that not even he can reproduce consistently but I have seen it with my own eyes. We have a side bet that when this &#8220;get&#8217;s fixed&#8221; that it either works all the way or goes completely away - I am taking the it goes away stance.</p>

I do not live on the site. These should be pretty good considering I have a D200 and a bunch of images to profile. Here are a few of the Nikon Capture NX2 Picture Control settings for Aperture 3 - for the D200. They are close enough for rock n&#8217; roll and should give you a good idea where to start for the Nikon color rendering for this camera. As usual they are FREE. Would love to see what you guys come up with for this camera.</p>

<p>Here is the download  [download#20]. On another note I have been getting a lot or requests for D300 and D300s presets - no problem but someone sent me ONE file - I think I have that file nailed but really need some diversity so get in touch if you would like these and have a couple more files to send me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Ap3Merge.jpg"><img title="Ap3Merge.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/.thumbs/.Ap3Merge.jpg" border="0" alt="Ap3Merge.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="92" align="left" /></a>I am going to assume people that need this can find the menu items themselves so I am not going to repeat the documentation. I am also not going to walk through every combination of possible work-flow and connect all the dots that can be connected. I will leave that for the Aperture 3 File Management eBook update. Instead I am going to give a couple observations that maybe helpful after beating Aperture 3 over the head with some of my work-flows.</p>

<p>In a nut shell the new functionality is fantastic. I love that any combination of objects you select in the project inspector works. I love that you can open each exported thing as it&#8217;s own library. I love how smart it is in dealing with combinations of referenced and managed images. I love how it deals with off-line images. It for the most part works as you would expect, maybe even better. Apple did a great job covering the needs of just about everyone no matter how simple or complicated what you envision it should be not only possible but easy or easier than it was. The key to using this and having it work the way you really want it to is the judicious use of the consolidate and include preview checkboxes. You can make just about anything happen between multiple computers, libraries, whatever.</p>

<p>First - you are perfectly fine if all you do is add new big objects in multiple libraries. Big objects being albums, books, etc. You are also fine modifying the contents of those objects like adding or deleting images from those things or modifying book pages. If there happens to be conflicts  Aperture asks you which library takes precedence when merging. You get this choice once on import - not project by project or item by item so beware. If it does not ask you then there are no conflicts. Well almost - I have been able to create conflicts with individual image items that have gone undetected that just disappeared but I tried hard.</p>

<p>File status for master files (referenced/managed/off-line, etc) is completely independent for each library and works just like it should. Example - if you export a project from your main library that has referenced masters using the consolidate masters checkbox and import it on your laptop - everything works fine. If on your laptop you relocate those masters to somewhere completely different and then import that project back to your main library everything for both projects stays the same and works just like it should. Why would you want to do something like that? Well&#8230; How about sharing projects between computers and speeding up the transfer to sync them by NOT transferring the masters every time. No matter whether it is a computer in the same room or across the world this speeds common images/project transfer up a lot - especially if you choose NOT to include previews. I had a work-around for Aperture 2 but this is much faster and easier. Heck all of those associations are image master by image master so you can do all sorts of nifty things.</p>

<p>One might be a shared project with those masters that you work on on the road and at home. You could also select your 5 star smart album for your entire library as a separate export even if they had overlapping images. In the first export you consolidate masters and do not include previews. In the second export you don&#8217;t consolidate masters but include previews. When you import both into your laptop library you can relocate the masters for that shared project so they will never transfer again. You will also have previews with off-line masters for all your 5 star images that you can share with iLife on your laptop. It doesn&#8217;t matter that some of those have masters and some of them don&#8217;t. When you ship the project back to your main library everything will be just fine when you merge. Very cool - completely independent file status per library. Go wild any selection can be exported using this do a couple of different exports some with masters some without. Some with previews some without - go wild.</p>

<p>Now about adjustments to images that exist on both machines. The short answer is only adjust image versions on one machine at a time before merging the changes. If you must do it on both machines to the same set of images do yourself a favor and make a new version when you do. Even this has it&#8217;s drawbacks - I don&#8217;t know if it is a bug and will get fixed or that is just the way it is. Heck it could be my Aperture 3 installation at this point but here is what happens even if you don&#8217;t make new adjustments of both machines - let&#8217;s say some new versions.</p>

<p>Say you had a couple of albums that contain those image versions already. You create a new image version on your laptop and ship it back to your desktop. That version will show up in the stack at the project level but&#8230; it will not be in the stack in the albums that already existed for that stack. No this is not a feature - in fact the album will show the correct number of images after everything is merged but when you open it in any album that existed before the new version was created on the laptop you will NOT see the new version. Not earth shattering but definitely confusing considering stacks are stacks. This could have serious consequences to your work-flow and overall organization scheme. The image at the top shows this if the words are not clear - also note the version names!</p>

<p>On another note - even if you move masters back and forth with completely consolidated managed libraries projects etc. Changes to the master files are NOT picked up in a merge. For instance write metadata to the masters for a project that already exists in two libraries and then merge them the library that you DID NOT write the metadata to will still not have the metadata in the masters. Get it? Again not a giant deal just be aware in your planned work-flow.</p>

<p>By the way you do not have to drag and drop one library onto another to import/merge there are a million ways to do it - file import-&gt;lbrary/project, double clicking a different library while Aperture is open with a different one, etc. That is probably obvious but just wanted to put it out there.</p>

<p>Hope this helps some of you that have large libraries and sophisticated multi-computer workflows.</p>

It is one of those little things and this one although quiet is actually really cool. After pushing Aperture 3 and putting a lot of new features through their paces to discover depth (I love Aperture&#8217;s depth - there is always more than meets the eye), I stumbled onto &#8220;sticky selections&#8221;</p>

<p>It seems that Aperture three retains image selections individually for every single browser view for every single object. Project, album, smart album, everything. If you make a selection and click somewhere else on the library and go back your selection is still exactly what it was before. You can make a selection in one project, jump to another album in another project, make a new selection, etc, etc. Every single one of them will still be there when you go back.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s more is that these selections are all persistent even if you exit Aperture and get back in. Very very handy. I actually noticed this when stress testing the heck out of the new project/library merge features and I have a lot of good news on that front. I think  I will write up some of my findings today or tomorrow. Just one or two other things that crossed my mind to finish figuring out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Ap3BestWorst.jpg"><img title="Ap3BestWorst.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/.thumbs/.Ap3BestWorst.jpg" border="0" alt="Ap3BestWorst.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="94" align="left" /></a>I have been using Aperture 3 intensively since it&#8217;s release and there is a lot here. All the good stuff is still in there with some more good stuff piled on. That does not mean that the world is perfect. It&#8217;s not. So here is a quick run down of some of my favorite new stuff and stuff that is bugging the crap out of me.</p>

<p>The good stuff first - I already mentioned that Places is fantastic. The local adjustments are really nice as well. You do need to be a little creative with them to get to where you want to go but that is par for the course with this kind of stuff. I will talk a little bit more about local adjustments and the new curves tool in a stand alone article they deserve it. So here is a list of things that I think are not so headline worthy but none the less big big time savers.</p>

<ol>
    <li>The ability to select more than one item in the project inspector. This is so useful and so much faster. I complained bitterly about this since V1. Finally fixed. On the surface it&#8217;s great for moving stuff around but it is also so much more. Lot&#8217;s of functionality works the way it should when you select multiple objects in the project inspector. Consider this - If you select a Blue folder - or a couple of Blue folders or a blue folder and two other projects and select export project/library from the the context menu it exports ALL of them that can be used on their own or imported and synchronized with a different library. This is a huge deal for doing all kinds of things for a lot of different work-flows. Moving lots of projects around at the same time is of course fantastic as well.</li>
    <li>The &#8220;Show in project&#8221; function. You get at this through the image context menu when viewing smart albums and searches. 9 times out of 10 you want to get to the project that contains the image - my work around was to display the project name in one of my viewer metadata overlays then manually go to the project. This one feature will cumulatively save me like years. Make it better - add a shortcut key - I did.</li>
    <li>All the new sort options for every browser - heck since they work the way they used to being sticky for every object so they are even better. Some albums you want sorted one way and some you want sorted another with out having to switch back and forth and back and forth.</li>
    <li>The new &#8220;source&#8221; feature for smart albums. This is fantastic. Before Aperture 3 the search context was set when you created the smart album - there was no changing it. This is good because sometimes you want to move smart albums while retaining their search context. The down side was there was no way to copy the criteria of a smart album and use it in a different context - now you have both ways. A very very good implementation and big time saver if you use a lot of similar smart albums like I do. Never recreate the same search criteria again. Just copy the smart album - drag it to a new location and set the source.</li>
    <li>Custom ordering of objects in the project inspector. Wow this is great, just drag it to where you want it to be. Very cool.</li>
    <li>Metadata - IPTC core, XMP import, metadata synchronization. More on this later but so far so good and eagerly awaited.</li>
    <li>64 bit - it is fast and it handles HUGE files - my 1+ gig scans actually work reasonably well.</li>
</ol>


<p>So now the worst. I won&#8217;t go into Faces again since we have reports from some of our buddies on the site that it is working great for them (event photographers) we will give that a wait and see. I won&#8217;t go into the stupid change for change&#8217;s sake of the way RAW+JPG works AFTER  the import  again. So here are the top duds.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Glitch after glitch after glitch. I expected this with such a HUGE upgrade in features + 64 bit and I do have faith it will get fixed quick. I just hope they get to my big time wasters. After pressing my system &#8220;normally&#8221; (for me) I have to restart Aperture 3 a lot. In fact I have to reboot OSX in a lot of cases. Things get so screwed up that Photoshop won&#8217;t even run stand alone amongst other things. Extreme strangeness in full screen mode, weird behavior when panning two or more zoomed images (all images in between become selected and zoomed). TIP: if your HUD is docked in full scrreen DO NOT EXIT OR ENTER FULL SCREEN WITH THE HUD DISPLAYED.</li>
    <li>Some of the UI choices. You probably guessed that I do not care for the cutesy stuff like cork board or felt tip marker fonts but that is not what I am talking about. When you enter Faces or Places for instance it looks like you have a browser and a viewer - wrong you are &#8220;somewhere else&#8221; - you are in a mode. A mode? I hate being in a mode. What is worse is things that you think should happen don&#8217;t - When in Places and you hit the V key to go somewhere else it just boinks at you. What the hell does Apple think you want to do? Do they think you want the computer to boink when you hit V in Faces or Places? TIP: I customized the Alt-Command V, B, S, F, and P keys since they are all open and they respectively give me viewer, browser, split, Faces, and Places. That should save my sanity. This is very un-Apple-y - very un-Aperture-y.</li>
    <li>Everything is turned on by default - just like before. Hence people with 4 year old mac books and 1 gig of ram will be clogging up the support forum complaining about performance for the next 10 years.</li>
    <li>Apparent lack of incremental adjustments in presets. Yea I know but this sucks no matter if it is a preset or a lift and stamp. I really would like an &#8220;increment&#8221; option.</li>
    <li>No love for the book tool - yea we have a couple of high end template providers but this is no real new functionality - I could do this before. I really wanted a couple of things in the book tool that has been the same since V1.</li>
</ol>


<p>I have some other goods an bad as well but we will focus on them later - what are your best and worst so far?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The other day I was complaining about some of the new Aperture 3 &#8220;features&#8221;. One of those being the changes to the way Aperture handles RAW+JPG. I wanted to post an update to the old workflow suggestion that I had with the Aperture 3 equivalent. I also wanted to clarify some of my earlier comments as they were terse and not fully articulated.</p>

<p>I think the new import options are fantastic. Having the option to import them together, together but as separate masters, or even just the JPEGs and then later the associated RAW are great and could help with a lot of diverse work-flows out there. I think the new image badges are a nice improvement as well. Knowing whether you are looking at something based on the RAW master or the JPEG master is added functionality.</p>

<p>The only issue I have is the useless and really slow needless change from Aperture 2&#8217;s &#8216;New Version From Master JPEG&#8221; to Aperture 3&#8217;s TWO different functions &#8220;Set JPG as master&#8217; and &#8216;Set RAW as master&#8221;  - these are senseless. There are maybe 3 occasions ever you would want to do this for already existing versions - one of them being you picked the wrong import option. The others being you had adjustments that were anywhere near appropriate for both masters. In either case the old functionality was no slower or no more complicated dealing with this.</p>

<p>Enough of that - to make life more bearable I setup some new custom shortcut keys to deal with it a little closer to my existing workflow. I set up Control-J to &#8220;Set JPEG as Master&#8221;. Just to keep things symmetric I also set up Control-R as &#8220;Set RAW as master&#8221;. Now I can have similar functionality to the old way. Here it is;</p>

<ul>
    <li>Select all images (Command-A)</li>
    <li>New album from selection (Command-L)</li>
    <li>New version from master (Option-G)</li>
    <li>Set JPEG as master (Control-J)</li>
</ul>


<p>Similar but one additional shortcut key and a lot slower for some reason - the actual set JPEG as master seems to take way longer than the <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2009/01/14/aperture-2-quick-tip-shooting-rawjpg/">old way</a>.</p>
