  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/irvingpenn.jpg"><img title="irvingpenn.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/.thumbs/.irvingpenn.jpg" border="0" alt="irvingpenn.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="149" height="150" align="left" /></a>Okay - back to old school. If you have not delved into Irving Penn&#8217;s work, you should. Not just a quick fly by, or surf by. You cannot really get a sense of this guy looking at his images for about 1/2 second each. I was quite the radical - not just in his time. In any time. Again, it&#8217;s all about the subtlety. His radical nature does not SCREAM at you. I guess that is why he was so successful for so many decades as both an artist and a commercial image maker.</p>

<p>Here is a brief story about how I found Irving Penn. Let&#8217;s suffice to say I was not &#8220;educated&#8221; on the who&#8217;s who in the photographic elite of all time - I am now, just not way back. When I was first shooting seriously in my 20&#8217;s I had never heard of Irving Penn. I met him on a train as a young, clueless kid - I met him because he sat down at a table where I had  a bunch of portraits I had made the week before spread out in front of me making notes on them with a grease pencil and sorting them into a couple of different piles. He asked me what I was doing and I said a couple of patronizing words to sort of brush off this old guy - I was frustrated and busy and did not feel like getting into a stupid conversation about &#8220;what kind of camera&#8221; I used or anything. I wasn&#8217;t mean or abrasive or ignorant. I quite literally told him that I was frustrated and was concentrating on my edits using a couple additional words.</p>

<p>Long story short - He lingered for a few moments, asked if he could look at one of the prints I had made some notes on, I said yes. He picked it up and looked at it. Put it down gently and said &#8220;You have a good eye - don&#8217;t get so frustrated with the technical stuff&#8221;. Excused himself, gave me his card and told me to look him up when I was in town.</p>

<p>I looked him up when I got home from that trip - that is how I found out who Irving Penn was. A week LATER. I never did &#8220;look him up&#8221; in the other sense he meant - I was far too embarrassed at my ignorance.</p>

I may still be crazy for thinking that I can do this for $8.99 and keep my sanity. We will see - the jury is still out. Just wanted to post a brief update and answer a couple of questions that people had on the print samples. So here we go.</p>

<p>1) I absolutely will ship internationally. So far I have had a couple of people inquire about this. For the most part I am willing to eat the cost difference to the EU for a single print. For more than one - get in touch and we can work something out.</p>

<p>2) I mentioned a brief write up will be included - here is what it amounts to: My shooting notes when I made the negative. My darkroom notes from when I processed the negative - times/temps/agitation/etc. My darkroom notes on how the print was made - exposure/contrast/developer/etc. I do throw in a couple of observations about the entire print/film/exposure decisions/etc. This is a very brief one pager - not a how to book.</p>

<p>3) Unless something changes I will probably be expanding and fine tuning this a little. I have already gotten some interesting ideas and suggestions so if you have a suggestion/request feel free to let me know via email or just comment on the site.</p>

<p>I was really surprised at the reasons that people might want a sample print - My intent was just to give people an up close and personal of some specific black and white papers with common film formats. Of course that is great but the reasons for some people wanting these is very diverse - specific lenses, cameras, films, developers. Etc. So far I have accommodated special requests - If I can I will.</p>

<p>The first products will ship this weekend - Thanks for all the encouragement and seriously let me know what other things might be of interest. <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/black-and-white-sample-prints/">If you want one of the highly NOT collectable sample prints from edition one gotta get me the order before Friday morning</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/1999_021_08small.jpg"><img title="1999_021_08small.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/.thumbs/.1999_021_08small.jpg" border="0" alt="1999_021_08small.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="120" height="150" align="left" /></a>Okay - Here they are. Real honest to goodness hand made black and white prints on real honest to goodness bayarta coated fiber based silver gelatin paper. This is an experiment. If it goes well and I can continue to do it without killing myself I will expand it to cover more materials or whatever other suggestions or ideas popup. If I cannot do it and remain sane I will cancel it and fulfill any pending orders.</p>

<p>Here is what I did to make this what I thought it should be. I selected 4 different negatives that have massively different tonalities on 4 very common films that can be obtained just about anywhere on the planet. The negatives were shot on both 35mm and 120 medium format black and white films and processed in very different but easily obtainable developers. Even though they have massively different tonality - they are all will make a reasonable print without any gymnastics whatsoever. In other words a strait print with no dodging burning bleaching toning - nothing. Print, develop, fix, wash, dry. that is it. Of course you or I could do just about anything to them and interpret the negative a thousand different ways. That is not the point of the print samples.</p>

<p>The point is to have a sample of what currently available analog materials that will provide reasonable results in anyone&#8217;s home darkroom will do - up close and personal with just rudimentary care and basic skill. On top of that if you already do this, you may want to get a sample of some materials that I actually use. I swear I wish somebody was doing this when I ran across a material I was interested in before investing $100 in it.</p>

<p>So what are the materials? For the experimental launch of this endeavor I am focusing on a paper that I discovered a short time ago - Adox MCC 110 Fiber based paper. I really like this stuff. It is a remake of an Agfa classic that was much loved but is now gone. The original version was Agfa Classic 111 paper. The emulsion itself is the same but they actually made it a bit different and in my opinion better. The MCC is coated on a brighter white base instead of warm base. This combination with a very slightly warm emulsion, just a tick warmer than completely neutral is very subtle and very very nice without being over the top warm like a lot of warm tone papers are. I am so enamored with it, I chose it to be the center of this little experiment.  <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/black-and-white-sample-prints/">You can get your sample print right here</a>. Hurry while supplies last - only kidding - hurry before I am declared insane and hauled off to the asylum for trying to actually do this for a reasonable price. If I start to fall behind it is over real quick.</p>

<p>Wish me luck - if the negatives that I have selected do not suit your needs for a sample let me know why and I will try to accommodate.</p>

I also got a couple requests to recommend the &#8220;best&#8221; book of Sieff&#8217;s work. Well I have a few and have no idea if there are newer better books than my favorite. My favorite book that I happen to own on Sieff is titled &#8220;Jeanloup Sieff 40 Years of Photography&#8221;. This book is fantastic, it is printed well, has a diverse selection of his work on the various genres and formats he used. It also has a great biography that is interesting and engaging. As soon as I read this book I instantly got where this guy was coming from and found that I shared similar aesthetic sensibilities as well as similar attitudes towards things in life (not always positive).</p>

<p>The really great thing about this book is the captions on all of the photographs. They are open, truthful without a hint of pretense. It is almost like you are sitting down having a candid private conversation with Sieff - one that he would have with a trusted friend. I guess that is what struck me about this particular book. The photographs he choose and the personal captions are truly unique from a photographer of this calibre.</p>

<p>Here are just two random examples of what I am talking about:</p>

<p>The Duchess of Windsor, Paris 1953</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a portrait commissioned by &#8216;Elle&#8217;. Having no idea what to do with the good woman, I had her go deeper and deeper under the branches of this tree, hoping against hope that she would disappear altogether.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dressing room at Guy Laroche, Paris 1957</p>

<p>&#8220;Today models where tights rather than girdles&#8230;.(more). Pity, there was something moving about the elastic marks&#8230;(more)&#8221;</p>

<p>This is the book I am talking about.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have had about 700 people email me questions about various films/developers/papers/lenses and equipment that I happen to comment on here at the old random photography blog that is sometimes chockfull of Aperture goodness. A heck of a lot of those questions are about film, paper, prints, and developer materials for film photography. Hey I may be one of the few that love the stuff but I have become acutely aware that there are many more photographers and even consumers of photography that are also interested in film and traditional photographic materials.</p>

<p>I say this all the time and really mean it - you have to see it in person to appreciate it. Words and stupid web images do not cut it. If I could afford to be a wealthy philanthropist I swear I would send out actual samples of various materials to anyone that was interested. I am not so here is stupid product idea #17 that may eventually morph into something else if there is any interest whatsoever. Ta Da.</p>

<p>Samples of stuff that I happen to use without making an investment in any of it. Samples of some of the various fiber based papers that I happen to use - real fiber silver paper - not inkjet. With actual 8x10 prints on them. I am not talking about &#8220;art&#8221; with ridiculous prices like $600 for a print. I am talking about a work grade print on materials that I happen to use priced at the cost of materials + shipping in a &#8220;do not bend fold or mutilate&#8221; envelope. Like 5 or 10 bucks.</p>

<p>I may even give you a choice of a couple different formats of negative or something like that. I figure it might be worthwhile for those that are interested in &#8220;real&#8221; analog photography and what it looks like from a home darkroom AND people that already know but want a sample of a particular material they want to try without investing in 100 sheets of the stuff.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>[poll id=&#8221;14&#8221;]</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. If anyone is interested in this I may actually expand the idea to a sample book of paper and even some big sheet film negative/developer/paper sample packages or something like that. I really believe in this stuff and want to make it more accessible to others if I can.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/GLMedia_189.jpg"><img title="GLMedia_189.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/.thumbs/.GLMedia_189.jpg" border="0" alt="GLMedia_189.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="99" height="150" align="left" /></a>Some random end of year thoughts on the aesthetics of a photographic print vs. looking at an image on a monitor. It is probably obvious that my preferred medium for the presentation of an image is print. For whatever reason this is how I like to see photographs and because of that I tend to believe that it is the best medium for a still image. I also believe that a print vs a transmitted light image are two completely different mediums that have nothing to do with each other.</p>

<p>Heck - cameras, film, and digital - capture devices of all kinds seek to improve for the most part so that you can make a better print. Do you need all of the tonal variations that film or a 16bit per color channel image contains to represent that image on an 8bit medium? No. Do you need all of the detail and resolution? No. All of this stuff is for prints. Printed still images for the most part are all about subtlety. All things being equal a print embellishes so much more than an image displayed on a screen.</p>

<p>I sometimes forget this because I spend way too much time on my computer consuming still images. The experience is completely different. The exercise in producing a print - no matter how it&#8217;s done is completely different. It is so different that for a lot of my images that have existed as prints and only prints for a long long time, I dread to look at them on the computer as a scanned image. Why is this - it is a completely different medium and to attempt to reproduce what I like in the print on-screen is a very very difficult exercise - usually unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Let me give you an example - if a bit contrived for illustration. There are a number of images that I choose to print on a &#8220;soft&#8221; paper. Soft in the sense of it&#8217;s texture, lack of brilliance in the highlights, and low D-MAX blacks - soft in a lot of other subtle ways that can only exist in the world of a print. Trying to reproduce these images on a computer screen ends up to be very frustrating and without fail they end up pretty much a completely different image on-screen.</p>

<p>The reason that I am going on about this is I see the effect in reverse for a lot of photographers that really never got into making fantastic prints. they may have had crappy prints from the local drug store and one of the reasons that they love digital is how &#8220;good&#8221; images from their DSLR look on-screen. When they print it, not so good. So they don&#8217;t print. Or&#8230; They judge print quality solely by the very superficial quality of the first impression they get that most closely resembles the snappy contrast that the see on their screen. Usually not the best way to go about judging what a good print is from your image.</p>

<p>I am a big advocate the ability of controlling your process from end to end - I have been since I was very young and started processing and printing my own images. To be very candid this is not the path that is the best path for every photographer out there. In fact it may be the best path for a inconsequential minority of people. The giant issue is that the whole digital &#8220;revolution&#8221; pushes this end to end learn it all, be good at it all, do it all yourself agenda. The manufacturers buy into it because there is a never ending stream of products that will &#8220;help&#8221; you do this. The vast majority of photographic web sites and evangelists buy into this and write countless how to do this and how to do that content. Especially with Photoshop.</p>

<p>Here is a radical thought for you to consider for 2010 - maybe you don&#8217;t want to do it yourself. Maybe you just want to be a good photographer - in a very limited sense of the word, let&#8217;s define that as being able to frame and compose a good image and have a good sense of timing and maybe even how to use your camera most effectively for a given situation and last but not least a good sense of light. Let somebody else deal with making the final product that you envision up to and including the print.</p>

<p>Yep it&#8217;s radical but definitely not new. Many many of the greatest photographers of all time worked this way - living and dead. Salgado. I do not know many people that do not like at least some of his work. If you have not seen a Salgado print in person you do not know what you are missing. Here is is secret - he does nothing but capture the image and direct the final result. Of course he has an intimate relationship with the person that does the &#8220;post processing&#8221; - film development, printing, whatever.</p>

<p>In reality this model was more the norm than the exception less than 10 years ago. Now? Not so much. I have had a ton of contact with some fantastic photographers in the last few months since I did the Inside Analog Photo Radio interview. The vast majority of them either still shoot film or returned to it for just this reason. It not only has an aesthetic they like but it is easier. Their exposure method is absolutely fool proof. They have a close relationship with the labs they use for processing and printing. Without fail they shoot and somebody else produces the output - digital and print that fits their vision. They save time, produce better color, and they enjoy this whole photography thing again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/default_ecard_sieff_01_0706191731_id_51257.jpg"><img title="default_ecard_sieff_01_0706191731_id_51257.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/.thumbs/.default_ecard_sieff_01_0706191731_id_51257.jpg" border="0" alt="default_ecard_sieff_01_0706191731_id_51257.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="left" /></a>Funny thing - I have had a ton of people come up and thank me for posting the little blurb regarding Jeanloup Sieff. Well not really &#8220;come up&#8221; but email me, message me, and even mention it in another forum. Seems that a lot of people really like his work, did find it inspirational, and here is the surprise - NEVER HEARD OF HIM BEFORE.</p>

<p>Well - here is a couple of little tidbits that I thought might also be interesting to you. First off he is not a large format photographer, he is not a medium format photographer, and he is not a 35mm photographer. He is all three. So many photographers are nailed to a format, even if they occasionally shoot in a different format. Ansel Adams - large format guy. Richard Avedon - Large format guy, etc. Sieff used 35mm, medium format, and large format with equal success and was not pinned down to the conventions and methods of working with each of them. One of the reasons his work is so diverse. To this day whenever I get uptight because somehow I feel pressure to focus my attention on a specific format with all of the trappings that go along with them I think of Sieff&#8217;s work and I relax and do what I feel like doing today.</p>

<p>I know you are all dying to know what stuff he used. Okay - from my recollection he shot Leica range finders in 35mm, Hasselblad gear in medium format, and to tell you the truth I really do not recall what is 4x5 gear was.</p>

<p>If you like his work on the internet you owe it to yourself to grab a well printed book of his work. A good place to start would be one of the retrospectives that encompass a good representation of all three formats. I have probably copied Sieff &#8216;s work more than just about any other photographer when I used to shoot commercial (at least when I was allowed to).</p>

I sought him out after trying to figure out who the heck shot some of the fashion advertising images in magazines that I was blown away with. When I was a late teenager or in my early twenties I read a biography that was available and instantly knew that I identified with his aesthetic and more than that totally got where he was coming from. He remains on my top list even now through a my very jaded perspective.</p>

<p>I find <a href="http://www.jeanloupsieff.com/#">Jeanloup Sieff&#8217;s</a> images as fresh today as the moment I saw the first one that knocked my socks off. You can see his official website here but like a lot of photographer sites, it is a pain in the ass and is not at all comprehensive of his work. This guy shot for a long long time and is usually recognizable at first glance, his work is diverse and extremely vast. You may be better off just using g<a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;resnum=0&amp;q=jeanloup+sieff&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ei=ubI3S7GJFpCXlAf76vmQBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=image_result_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBwQsAQwAA">oogle image for Jeanloup Sieff</a>.</p>

<p>One more thing - like a lot of fantastic work you have to see the prints - really. Even a well done book on good paper will leave your jaw on the floor.</p>

<p>Enough words - Enjoy!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/2002_919_06.jpg"><img title="2002_919_06.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/.thumbs/.2002_919_06.jpg" border="0" alt="2002_919_06.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" align="left" /></a>What do I mean &#8221; be careful what you ask for&#8221;? Well it maybe exactly opposite of what you want. I teach this concept at my workshops in a variety of different ways but decided that today I would be very direct about it instead taking the long way around it. I have thought about this a lot because I have found that the words and concepts that are sought after by countless photographers in many many cases are exactly opposite of what they are trying to achieve aesthetically. Obviously experience will eventually reconcile these things but still a lot of words persist and continue to be the holy grails of photography even once that experience and reconciliation takes place.</p>

<p>Let me explain that a little bit more with some photographic holy grail goodness. With almost no exceptions photographers in general - especially enthusiastic newbies (anyone that isn&#8217;t dead yet for the most part) what more better photographic holy grail stuff like more better sharper lenses. More better resolution. More better tonal differentiation. More better acutance. More better contrast. More better detail. When was the last time you &#8220;upgraded&#8221; anything seeking &#8220;less worse&#8221; rather than &#8220;more better&#8221;?</p>

<p>Hey I am all for &#8220;more better&#8221;. In a lot of my personal aesthetic goals I happen to like &#8220;more better&#8221; of some of the &#8220;more better&#8221; stuff that I mentioned. Here is the rub - the collective subconscious union of &#8220;more&#8221; with &#8220;better&#8221; - especially with some of those things that I mentioned. Sharpness, tonal differentiation/separation, resolution, acutance, detail, etc. The list goes on and on. The problem is better is an aesthetic choice, more is a factual objective measurement. In many ways they can be at completely opposite ends of the spectrum for your particular  aesthetic goals for a given subject, project, phase of the moon, mood, or stage of life.</p>

<p>In many many cases less is more suited to a particular aesthetic set of goals. Really keep this in mind when making adjustments to your technique, material choices, process, equipment, etc. Heck even the choice of lens aperture can have a fairly large if subtle impact on you achieving an aesthetic goal. Even if the macro effect on depth of field is minor or non-existant keep in mind that there is no such thing as depth of field - just degrees of &#8220;acceptable&#8221; out of exact focus.</p>

<p>I guess my point is that sometimes when you are not achieving a particular aesthetic that you are looking for the automatic more=better is not the direction you want. More may actually be taking you in the opposite direction of where you want to go. Half of the issue is a lack of visual association with commonly used terminology. The other half is marketing.</p>

<p>How many people want a really really &#8220;hard&#8221; light source for a beauty shot? You would probably rather a really big &#8220;soft&#8221; &#8220;beauty dish&#8221;. Talking about either of these without talking about lighting ratio is meaningless to achieving any particular aesthetic goal. I have attached a very specific example - we won&#8217;t even need to look at these at any magnification just web size. The image at the top of the post is more better everything. It is a 2 foot diameter extremely expensive beauty dish at an optimum distance from the subject with no fill at all except some light bouncing off of very dark skin. I used a lens of fantastic resolution, sharpness, contrast, etc. The film was process in a developer that is capable of extreme acutance/sharpness and above all differentiates subtle tonal differences like nothing else. It was no surprise that it looks like it was carved out of metal. In a lot of cases I like that penetrating aesthetic and find that level of detail extremely interesting and &#8220;beautiful&#8221;.</p>

<p>Our second image was shot was with an extremely hard light source about 6&#8221; in diameter<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/DSC_4020.jpg"><img title="DSC_4020.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/.thumbs/.DSC_4020.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_4020.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="right" /></a> from way way further away with 1:1 lighting ratio at an axis exactly in line with the lens axis. The lens was not particularly spectacular but fine. The medium it was shot on cannot differentiate tonal variations very well, it has 10 times worse resolution. No ability to differentiate subtle tonal differences from a relative point of view. Virtually no detail. Heck there is not one single objective parameter that was &#8220;better&#8221; but is not at all what you would expect based on the original question about what light source do you want? However it may have been exactly what you were trying to do aesthetically.</p>

<p>Okay enough already - I hope someone finds this useful at all.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/name_counter.jpg"><img title="name_counter.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/.thumbs/.name_counter.jpg" border="0" alt="name_counter.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="90" align="left" /></a>A lot of photographers out there depend on a file naming convention for their work-flow. They also depend on version names in Aperture tying back to that unique file name of the master image. Don&#8217;t ask me why this is such a big big deal for some photographers work-flow. I don&#8217;t really get it but accept it as necessary for some Aperture users. Some Aperture users have this all figured out and they have their work-flow down and wrapped up. Others don&#8217;t and have a &#8220;big issue&#8221; with Aperture and file naming/version naming, fighting with it every step of the way.</p>

<p>One thing that comes up over and over is renaming files AFTER importing them. I cover all this stuff in e<a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/aperture-ebooks/">xcruciating detail in the Aperture File Management eBook</a> but here is the secret - no matter weather you use referenced masters, managed masters or a combination of both. If for some reason you need to rename your masters such that they have a name of your specification and your Aperture versions need to match that - or at least the base part of it, this is at least a two step process if you forget to do it when you import your files.</p>

<p>Most of the confusion comes in when people try to use the Metadata-&gt;Batch Change&#8230; menu to deal with the issue and find that the master file names stay exactly what they were. Like a lot of functionality in Aperture - just about anything is possible - you need to be a little bit creative in applying Aperture&#8217;s capabilities. You do need to use Metadata-&gt;Batch Change&#8230; but you do that last. What you do first is use File-&gt;Relocate Master&#8230; to change the actual master file names. Yep - use relocate - even if your masters are managed - you can always just use consolidate to put them all back in the library if you want. If they are already referenced this is really a piece of cake.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you have a file name that is something goofy like CameraUsedDate6digitCounter and that naming preset happens to be at 005900. So your file names usually look like &#8220;NikonD3x-12262009-0058999.NEF&#8221;. For some reason you imported 100 images into a new project and did not use your name preset so all of the masters are still named DSC7654.NEF and so are all the versions that you see in Aperture. To put them all back into your nice fascist naming scheme here is what you do.</p>

<p>One - use File-&gt;Relocate master with all of those 100 files selected.  Make sure that the Name Format option is the exact one that you use during your usual import so that the &#8220;counter field&#8221; is the right &#8220;counter field&#8221;.</p>

<p><img title="relocate.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/relocate.jpg" border="0" alt="relocate.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="601" height="566" /></p>

<p>Two - When that is done select all the images that you just &#8220;relocated&#8221; even if they did not go anywhere and choose the &#8220;Metadata-&gt;Batch Change&#8230;&#8221; function.</p>

<p><img title="batch_change.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/batch_change.jpg" border="0" alt="batch_change.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="346" height="579" /></p>

<p>Here is the real tricky part. Pick the Name Format that you just used again but this time use the drop down &#8220;edit&#8230;&#8221; to edit that preset so that you can reset the counter to what it stated at when you renamed the master files. The whole goal here is to make the master and version names the same - right? Or at least sort of the same.</p>

<p><img title="name_counter.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/name_counter.jpg" border="0" alt="name_counter.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="644" height="388" />
Okay so I know what you might be thinking - well that will screw up everything because I have like 900 versions that I created of various black and white, crops, etc. Well here is where we get creative. If you create albums for everything new version you make and those albums have stack picks that are the new versions. It shouldn&#8217;t be too hard to figure out that you just need to use the batch change thing over and over and keep setting the counter appropriately along with a custom piece of stuff at the end that is to your liking. If your versions and version names are all over the place It will be much more work so try to deal with this at import or as early as possible.</p>

<p>One last thing to think about - if you are a little bit creative the you can use similar approaches to make various version sets in albums anything you want if you don&#8217;t like the default &#8220;XXXXXX - Version 3&#8221; type think Aperture does. You can do it without individually typing the version name for each and every image you make a new version of. Here is the secret - use batch change creatively.</p>

<p>Hope this clears up some confusion for those out there that this linkage is really really import for their work-flow. I still don&#8217;t really get why this is so critical for photographers but that is another conversation.</p>
