  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P1070239.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2378" title="P1070239" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P1070239-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>Yep - The GF1 is going back to Amazon but another one is on the way and should be here Monday or Tuesday. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the Camera. The problem was that after playing a lot with the 20mm f 1.7 lens I determined it was defective. The focus was super slow when it worked at all, both on the E-P1 and the GF1. The issue with slowness is that it&#8217;s subjective. My E-P1 with the 14-42 lens was far far far faster than the GF1 with the 20mm. When I switched lenses the GF1 was as fast or faster than the E-P1. I will have to do more testing with the same lens on each camera because the focus motor speed definitely is more than half the equation here.</p>

<p>The objective measurement of defective was the fact that every once in a while the lens would go berserk. No matter what focus mode you were in - even manual - the camera and lens would go into permanent and continuous racking back and forth between infinity and closest focus. When I say continuous and permanent I do mean that literally. As in the lens would continue to grind even if you set the camera down and left it be. It would go on quite possibly forever if you didn&#8217;t turn it off. Just for giggles I left it go for 10 minutes prior to getting sick of hearing it just to see if it would resolve sooner or later.</p>

<p>This condition was obviously a defect. So back to Amazon - gee those guys have the coolest and most responsive customer service on the planet. I paid extra for the need it now shipping and explained that I was returning (free) and buying another but did not want to pay for overnight shipping twice and within 2 minutes I had a refund on the original shipping cost.</p>

<p>I will say that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB002MUAEX4%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Ddp_olp_new_map%26qid%3D1284326621%26sr%3D8-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">20mm and the GF1</a> made nice images when it actually worked. Attached is the very last image that I shot prior to provoking the bizarre behavior and the camera getting the heave ho.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While I am waiting for my replacement <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB002MUAEX4%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Ddp_olp_new_map%26qid%3D1284329376%26sr%3D8-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Panasonic GF1</a> I thought you would find this amusing if you are trying to decide between the two cameras. Everyone wants to know about noise. Neither of these cameras bother me in that regard as I explained in <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2010/09/06/olympus-e-p1-high-iso/">this post regarding E-P1</a>. In normal image making scenarios you would hope that this level of noise would be overwhelmed by detail and an interesting image. I won&#8217;t make much of a judgement here - you decide what camera is better for yourself. These are Aperture screen shots so you can see what I see. I will say that the Olympus JPEG engine shines (again) with it&#8217;s &#8220;normal&#8221; settings. The Panasonic JPEG engine is actually quite good but nowhere near as capable in the noise department.</p>

<p>To be blunt - either of these RAW files could be run through any one of a couple of different de-noisers and look pretty much perfect. I know Nik DFINE does it. I doubt that these cameras will ever see the north side of 800 ISO in my hands but here is what &#8220;bad&#8221; noise looks like on these two itty bitty cameras. In prints the images look fine.</p>

<p>Here are the JPEGS</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/jpg.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2384" title="jpg" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/jpg-300x187.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="187" /></a></p>

<p>Here are the RAWs with no noise reduction.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/RAW1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2386" title="RAW" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/RAW1-300x187.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="187" /></a></p>

<p>Yea, yea I know the color is a little different and the DOF is different just look areas where you can judge the easiest.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. If anyone is interested I will show you the comparison at 3200 as well - there the Olympus blows the Panasonic GF1 away due to the GF1 having &#8220;banding&#8221; in the noise pattern, the GF1 doesn&#8217;t even allow 6400.</p>

I wanted to give you Aperture users who are thinking about these cameras or camera users who are thinking about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB002I0JKSS%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dsr_1_1_olp%26s%3Delectronics%26qid%3D1284312275%26sr%3D1-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">Aperture 3</a> a quick and dirty report on RAW file performance for these two little cameras. The bottom line is that I doubt anyone will be unhappy with Aperture 3&#8217;s default RAW processing.</p>

<p>Of course you will have to setup some presets for your tastes but looking at the RAW files sans adjustments in Aperture 3 from both cameras is a joy. I have shot about 400 images of my patented StupidCrap™ and have found no horrendous WB issues, No significant hue cross-overs and generally a decent interpretation of color from both the Olympus and Panasonic sensors. The contrast and saturation are not exactly the same as either camera&#8217;s &#8220;neutral&#8221; or &#8220;natural&#8221; settings but are pretty close and above all &#8220;pleasing&#8221;.</p>

<p>I will do a follow up report on thinks like dynamic range etc. as to how worthwhile the RAW files are in the context of Aperture down the road. For now Here are a couple of Aperture 3 default conversions as compared to the out of camera neutral JPG&#8217;s. These are all from the Panasonic GF1.</p>

<p>I tried to show a variety of color temperature, lighting contrast, and hues from subtle to bold, neutral to primaries. I am not super unhappy with these and the Olympus files look just as good or better from a default RAW decode in Aperture 3. Just a note - ACR 6 did not do as good a job with the default color interpretations. It&#8217;s not &#8220;bad&#8221; but there is definitely more of a hue shift on many colors compared to OOC JPEG files and get this Lightroom / ACR fans, the shifts were not in what I would consider a pleasing manner! I will probably do a more detailed analysis and post my findings from a color/detail/noise perspective because you guys/gals no - I just can&#8217;t help myself even though I will choose the tool overall vs one aspect. I&#8217;ll share the results soon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9110417.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2361" title="P9110417" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9110417-300x136.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="136" /></a>The FedEx man finally came to deliver my Panasonic 20mm f 1.7 lens that happened to come with a free (see previous posts) GF1 camera in the box. What a deal. You&#8217;ll have to wait to see a couple images and tests from the GF1 as the battery was completely dead except for the 5 minutes or so I spent confusing the crap out of myself with the menus. I do have to say my first impressions are that I like the E-P1 handling a bit better than the GF1 but we really won&#8217;t know for sure until I figure it out.</p>

<p>The thing that intrigued me is that the I was overall not at all impressed with the AF speed compared to the E-P1. In fact it seemed slower, even with the 20mm lens. Hmmm. Could be a dead battery. Could be me having no idea what I am doing with it yet. More later on this. The other thing that disturbed me was that I seemed to get the lens stuck in a mode of constant hunting twice with no way to cause it to cease and desist save for turning the camera off and back on. Could be anything, again waiting for the battery to charge.</p>

<p>Here are a couple of items of note regarding the GF1:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Far better looking in person than what you may think. Really nice.</li>
    <li>A hair lighter than the E-P1 but not as much as you would think. Not really going to be a deciding factor from my standpoint.</li>
    <li>The screen is a lot higher resolution but doesn&#8217;t seem to make any real difference in use or enjoyment as compared to the E=P1</li>
    <li>I can tell you within 10  seconds that I like the overall layout and access to functions on the E-P1 better than the GF1 but I will have to give it some time. I can tell you that some functions and the way they work are better on the E-P1 and some are better on the GF1. In reality they are more the same than different unless the one thing that one camera does a hair differently than the other happens to be the make or break deal for you.</li>
</ol>


<p>Obviously I will have some follow up to this. Give me some time. I will tell you that something is very very wrong. I don&#8217;t know what yet but given the battery for the GF1 is dead, I tried the 20mm on the E-P1. Focus was hideously slow - as in broken slow. I mean broken because a lot of the behavior was bizarre. Constant non-stop focus hunting back and forth that wouldn&#8217;t and couldn&#8217;t be stopped with no buttons depressed. It seemed to happen after the first shot while trying to focus the second shot. I had to turn the camera off to stop it. Finally that ceased but behavior continued to be unexplainable.  Exposure in live view was all over the map but the actual saved images were fine. The Aperture opening and closing and changing f-stops while you watched - which may be normal but not in combination with the live view issues.</p>

<p>I will update all the firmware in the lens and bodies and get back to you on this. I may have a dud.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, do you remember my last post from about 3 hours ago where I said that a Panasonic 20mm f 1.7 micro 4/3 lens was showing up tomorrow? It happens to be attached to a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB002MUAEX4%3Fie%3DUTF8%26coliid%3D%26ref_%3Dolp_tab_used%26me%3D%26qid%3D1284169307%26qid%3D1284169307%26sr%3D1-1%26sr%3D1-1%26seller%3D%26colid%3D%26condition%3Dused&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Panasonic GF1 camera</a> that is pretty much free as we established from that entry level lesson on rationalizing gear money.

Well, I got to thinking about all that philanthropic work that I was going to do for all my fellow photo-oriented mankind and give you my take on the ups and downs of the Panasonic compact micro 4/3 versus the Olympus micro 4/3 systems. All that thinking lead me to believe that grabbing the 14-42 Panasonic lens was a must do so I could compare the two.</p>

<p>Believe it or not I didn&#8217;t order the 14-42. You see, thinking some more about it lead me to the conclusion that my fellow mankind would be served much better by ordering a Panasonic LX5 instead. I&#8217;ll walk through how I got there so it makes any sense. There are slightly more advanced rationalization techniques in use here so pay close attention so you can put them to good use in your photographic endeavors as well. This is really important stuff for all of you just starting out in acquiring just the right combination of gear.</p>

<ul>
    <li>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB002MUAEX4%3Fie%3DUTF8%26coliid%3D%26ref_%3Dolp_tab_used%26me%3D%26qid%3D1284169307%26qid%3D1284169307%26sr%3D1-1%26sr%3D1-1%26seller%3D%26colid%3D%26condition%3Dused&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Panasonic LX5</a> is almost the same price as the 14-42 lens as long as you are using the right rounding techniques.</li>
    <li>Using that same advanced mathematics it&#8217;s about the same size as well. So it&#8217;s exactly the same thing from a cost and size standpoint. In fact in any way you want to measure it as long as you are using the same kind of round numbers they are exactly the same purchase.</li>
    <li>Now when you factor in that I already have the Olympus 14-42 micro 4/3 lens that I have deemed perfectly fine, it makes the LX5 make much more sense.</li>
    <li>Not only much more sense but common sense tells you it&#8217;s actually better because the zoom range is better and the maximum aperture is better.</li>
    <li>So there is nothing that is not better about this idea. You see?</li>
    <li>Add on the good Karma from pointing out all the ups and downs of a true high-end compact vs the leading micro 4/3 systems and wow. I mean who out there doesn&#8217;t want to know this from being able to shoot them side by side?</li>
</ul>


<p>All that rationale aside - I have been grumbling about this really nice, really small, really good image quality, good performance camera thing for a long time. To be fair I have played with it before. I really have. My conclusion was that the category was still lacking in a big way. This was probably 2 years ago with minor dabbles along the way.</p>

<p>When I say lacking. I really don&#8217;t mean in some stupid comparison say between a GF1 or a Canon G10, or an LX3 or LX5 compared to say&#8230; A Nikon D3s. That&#8217;s ridiculous and probably will be depending on how you measure for quite some time to come. What I mean is lacking compared to what my personal minimum performance requirements have been for a picture taking device where I wouldn&#8217;t be constantly wishing I had my other camera because of real limitations for what I like to shoot - how I like to shoot it, and basic image quality that I will not find wanting.</p>

<p>Even with the announcements of the micro 4/3 when it looked pretty good the initial pricing was such that I didn&#8217;t want to bother with it. I didn&#8217;t want to bother with it because it was at least twice the cost of a similar or better performing DSLR from Nikon or Canon. I could easily just forgo the 17 lenses and go with one prime on say a D5000 for five hundred bucks. Over the last couple months the pricing of micro 4/3 in both the Panasonic and Olympus lines as come down to the same price points. Now we are cooking with gas so to speak.</p>

<p>So where does the LX5 come in. Well let me explain. The LX3 was a fantastic camera from a lot of perspectives except one. Handling and speed. The LX5 makes a couple of very big leaps in both categories that puts it in the running. I did also play with the G9 and G10 - I found them lacking in too areas for me to take the plunge. The G11 is a little too big - I rather have the GF1, but I cannot comment on it&#8217;s other characteristics as I have not used it first hand. So what the heck I figured the LX5 was a good jumping off point for me to compare with my new found fondness for micro 4/3. If the G11 is as good so be it. Doesn&#8217;t matter. I just wanted to know.</p>

<p>As I make my journey forward with my small camera bag I am going to share my experience with all of you that may have had the same set of things rattling around in your head for a while as well. I hope that my first hand observations will help those that really want to know how to choose between the emerging performance of the super-compacts and micro 4.3 for their small gear aspirations. I hope to be able to answer that given that in the past this was an easy answer for me - Leica M and never look back. That&#8217;s what I wanted and now there is not only that solution available but a few others that cost a little bit less.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. See what happens when I start with the gear? Holy crap. This is worse than looking at a Hasselblad catalog. At least that smacks you so hard in the face with heavy price tag that you think twice about hitting the buy button.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You guys/gals know how much I love my Leica gear due to the quality and the fact that I can fit everything I own - including stuff I don&#8217;t need into a little tiny bag. You also know that I don&#8217;t shy away from shooting film. You also may have picked up that I bought a compact digital to jamb in with my Leica kit. A cut-rate refurbished Olympus E-P1.</p>

<p>Well - I have been having so much fun with this little guy that I want to expand. I told you I will be disciplined and NOT buy a camera with a viewfinder until I thoroughly break my habit of &#8220;needing&#8221; one. I am not going to go back on that. I will spend a few months at this sans viewfinder. Meanwhile I did decide I want a fast small lens native to micro 4/3. You pretty much have two choices if you don&#8217;t want an adapter and you don&#8217;t want a tele. You have the Panasonic 20mm f1.7 and you have the Olympus 17mm f2.8.</p>

<p>This ones easy - give me the faster lens any day of the week. On top of that the internet crowd has blessed the Panasonic as &#8220;better&#8221;. Honestly I do not know how much weight I would but on that but it is undeniably more interesting to me because of the greater than 1 stop faster maximum aperture. So I am getting one. Here is the gear acquisition syndrome rationalization logic on this purchase broken down for you so you can adapt it to your own needs&#8230;</p>

<ul>
    <li>You cannot find reliable sources of used 20mm Panasonic&#8217;s that are any less money than new ones - in fact a lot of chuckleheads want MORE than a new one.</li>
    <li>The cheapest US source that I would buy from seems to be in the $394 neighborhood. Let&#8217;s say that is $400.</li>
    <li>I can get a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB002MUAEX4%3Fie%3DUTF8%26coliid%3D%26ref_%3Dolp_tab_used%26me%3D%26qid%3D1284150961%26qid%3D1284150961%26sr%3D8-1%26sr%3D8-1%26seller%3D%26colid%3D%26condition%3Dused&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">mint condition used Panasonic GF1 camera with a 20mm lens and goodies</a> with a return guarantee from $650. That&#8217;s like $600. (See this is GAS rounding watch what happens next)</li>
    <li>If I take the $400 off the $600 that is like $200 for a whole stinking camera the Panasonic GF1. That&#8217;s like free.</li>
    <li>If I have the GF1 I can really really compare the crap out of the Olympus to the Panasonic in all kinds of conditions and even have the VR on the Panasonic lens that I am getting any way but now I can tell you guys which stuff is actually better and when it is better. Is the focusing speed all in the lenses or is it the firmware or the body. This is like philanthropic work so it &#8216;s good karma and the body is like free anyway. You people want to know this stuff anyway.</li>
    <li>If I really really really need the EVF the Panasonic EVF is like $100 and that is like $200 less expensive than the Olympus EVF that won&#8217;t work unless I buy the E-P2 and that is like $1100 for the kit with the EVF so not only is the body free but potentially it will save me like thousands of dollars as well until I absolutely need an E-P2 or E-p3 or GF2.7</li>
</ul>


<p>Okay - done deal it&#8217;s coming tomorrow.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. Did you follow all that? Bottom line - you guys get to hear first hand about the ups and downs of both systems in all kinds of conditions because you know you want one of these things one way or the other and &#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9050341.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2353" title="P9050341" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9050341-300x239.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="239" /></a>I know you people are sick of my E-P1 crap by now but someone did ask me about video via email. I really am not prepared to answer that question. I bought this thing for stills, I honestly don&#8217;t know when I will use the video recording. My hard drives fill up with crap quickly enough. I did take a grand total of one handheld video and I was impressed with the &#8220;quality&#8221;. I will try to get up the energy to actually make a serious effort on the HD video for this little guy soon.</p>

<p>Until then let me give you my thoughts on video, HD video, and all of the internet generated shortcomings that have been bantered about regarding not only the Olympus Pen cameras but a lot of DSLR&#8217;s as well. I applied the same thought process to this camera as I have when considering other cameras that happen to do HD video. First off - for me it&#8217;s totally secondary at the moment. In fact it is not part of the equation but if it were I think most of the criticisms  about autofocus durning video, lack of exposure modes and adjustment while shooting video, and under performance of &#8220;vibration reduction&#8221; as some sort of commentary on the video performance is absolute hogwash written by neophytes that wouldn&#8217;t know the first thing about how to shoot a &#8220;high quality&#8221; video in the first place.</p>

<p>For instance - the complaint about AF and handholding. Hmmm. If you let the camera focus for you so that the focus jumps about AND you hand hold video it will suck. End of story the video will suck. Who the hell cares if it&#8217;s HD, it sucks. Same goes for &#8220;auto exposure&#8221; while shooting. Who cares about auto exposure - set it or lock it on the ONE exposure for that shot then shoot it. If you don&#8217;t the variation even by a little during that shot will also cause it to suck.</p>

<p>I know what you are thinking - you are thinking that I am absolutely around the bend on this one. Okay don&#8217;t believe me. Take a look at ANY good video. Let&#8217;s take something from Hollywood for a second. Is focus all over the place? How often does one see a change in focus point on a particular shot? Maybe 1% and even then how do you think that is done? hmmm. marks on the lens. marks on the floor, all preplanned and executed at the exact time the director wants it done. For the vast majority of shots it will be a pre-chosen focus point with a predetermined depth of field.  Same for exposure. Do you see the scene brightness jumping all over the place when the actors move or a window comes into the shot? Answer = no. Even across multiple shots that are supposed to be in the same location at the same time, even if they were shot weeks apart are at the same EV.</p>

<p>You starting to catch on here. Okay let&#8217;s take hand held shooting of video - again this happens 1% of the time and then half that is with a very very expensive steady-cam (look it up) or it&#8217;s all jiggly on purpose for special effect. You know like when it&#8217;s supposed to be footage taken by some POV victim that just got shot or blown up or trampled on by a monster. Okay so all the internet experts want a built in steady cam. Fine - if you use it for 100% of all your high quality HD footage your videos will still suck.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t shoot your video like this who the heck cares if it&#8217;s HD? Shoot it with your cell phone and save the effort and expense. Do you think the guys shooting serious stuff even with DSLR&#8217;s don&#8217;t shoot it the way I just explained? Of course they do. Check out the biggest proponent of HD video in DSLR&#8217;s on the planet. Laforet or whatever his name is.</p>

<p>Okay - so that&#8217;s my thoughts on all of the criticisms aimed at the E-P1. You have already seen what it can do on the commercial - of course the shot it just like they would if they were using a camera that cost a quarter million dollars. Se that is the great equalizer, not bull crap about auto exposure and autofocus on these toys.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just wanted to post a quick update on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB002CGSYKS%3Fie%3DUTF8%26coliid%3D%26startIndex%3D0%26ref_%3Dolp_pg_refurbished%26me%3D%26qid%3D1283800919%26qid%3D1283800919%26sr%3D8-1-catcorr%26sr%3D8-1-catcorr%26seller%3D%26colid%3D%26condition%3Drefurbished&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">little E-P1</a> and it&#8217;s high ISO performance. As some of you might know I am not the worlds biggest fan of super &#8220;perfect&#8221; images shot at astronomical ISO speeds. As long as 400 is workable I usually fine. In other words it is not my number one criteria in evaluating a camera. I know that most of the internet photographic community get&#8217;s it&#8217;s knickers in a bunch if even the slightest bit of noise can be detected when shooting a black featureless surface in the dark so take this assessment with that in mind.</p>

<p>Nobody really likes noise. Well I like some kinds of noise - like film grain with the right scene. The only real color &#8220;noise&#8221; that I ever appreciated was that of Kodachrome 200. That is the one film I liked the look of that had huge grain. Some folks like that Scotch Chrome 1000 or whatever. There was guy that made a career with that film shooting vodka bottles but that&#8217;s another story. My verdict on the E-P1 is that it more than passes my meager criteria for high ISO shooting. Heck I cannot wait to get my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB002IKLJVE%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dsr_1_1_olp%26s%3Delectronics%26qid%3D1283800671%26sr%3D8-1-catcorr%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">Panasonic 20mm f 1.7</a> and shoot with this thing. I really have no issue with the ISO 1600 performance for real world subjects that I am likely to shoot in light that low. They will look fine.</p>

<p>Believe it or not I feel the same way about 3200 and 6400 on this camera. Obviously it&#8217;s not appropriate if you want absolutely &#8220;perfect&#8221; color, detail, and smoooothness. Well actually you could crank either the on camera noise reduction up or the one in your image editor of choice and get smooth as well. Me - I won&#8217;t bother. Here&#8217;s why - most real world subjects I am likely to shoot in light that low are probably filled with detail. If they aren&#8217;t they will be more &#8220;set-up&#8221; because they are supposed to be perfect, meaning I will probably worry about the light first. So for the rest of it there is a good chance the look of the image will be appropriate for my purposes. Heck half the time I will probably want it black and white anyway.</p>

<p>When in black and white I will run it through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB001DEV95W%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dsr_1_fkmr0_2_olp%26qid%3D1283800713%26sr%3D8-2-fkmr0%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">Nik Silver EFX Pro</a> and one of their film simulations. Take my word for it that each and every film simulation in NIk, from 50 speed PanF to TMAX 100 to TMAX 3200, the grain engine totally overwhelms the digital noise by an order of magnitude and it looks fine. No need to run noise reduction first. Here are a couple of shots to see what I mean.</p>

<p>First off we have ISO 1600 strait out of camera with NR set to normal and everything else &#8220;flat&#8221;</p>

<p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9060348.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2339" title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9060348-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>

<p>Next we have the same image with a TRI-X simulation and no other changes.</p>

<p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9060348_1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2337" title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9060348_1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>

<p>Okay same thing at ISO 3200</p>

<p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9060351.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2341" title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9060351-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>

<p>Now with the same TRI-X simularion</p>

<p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9060351_1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2340" title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9060351_1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>

<p>Ultimately we have 6400 ISO - crazy stuff for a compact camera.</p>

<p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9060354.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2345" title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9060354-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>

<p>Same old TRI-X simulation</p>

<p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9060354_1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2342" title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9060354_1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>

<p>Now this is kinda moot because as I have explained before due to the way digital resizing works all of these images show way way more grain and noise than they should at these display sizes but will look fine when printed because&#8230;. printer pixels are SMALLER. Same goes for optical printing - grain gets SMALLER at small print sizes so you can&#8217;t see it. That is not what happens when you take a 12 MPIX image, add grain, then scale it down to screen size. The resize KEEPS THE NOISE/GRAIN AT SIMILAR SIZES TO WHAT IT WAS IN THE BIG IMAGE - ie. one or two pixels. That&#8217;s not the point - the point is that the film simulations render all three images pretty much identical. If you shoot color I would say you be the judge as to worrying about the high ISO. Me - I really don&#8217;t give a hoot about this level of noise in real world images, especially if my primary purpose is printing. As you can see, even with NO extra care the out of camera images look fine in color as long as their is detail and light gradation (usually the first couple of reasons to take an image in the first place). I do agree that a blank wall shot with 3200 and 6400 will look like crap. Who cares.</p>

<p>If you like to shoot/print black and white you have it made in the shade. Silver EFEX film simulations - every one - completely overwhelm any hint of noise even at extreme ISO&#8217;s on the E-P1. I already knew that but being the paranoid belt and suspenders kind of person I do like to know what to expect before committing. Hope this was at all useful to anyone out there biting their fingernails over the noise performance &#8220;issue&#8221; with this camera.</p>

<p>For you pixel peepers - here is worst case ISO 6400 in all it&#8217;s extreme magnification glory - who cares? Not me, but just to be complete you can&#8217;t have any kind of image review on the internet and not talk about the almighty 100% because you know that&#8217;s what people ask me all the time when I show them a book or a print. They say - &#8220;wow really nice but what does it look like at 100%?&#8221;</p>

<p>Click to get the actual pixels (don&#8217;t forget to enlarge in the lightbox if there is an icon in the upper right corner)</p>

<p>And the Silver EFEX Pro TRI-X simulation to see if you can find any of the original camera noise in it.</p>

<p>Have a great holiday (well at least in the USA)</p>

<p>Ps. If you like black and white but shoot digital <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB001DEV95W%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dsr_1_fkmr0_2_olp%26qid%3D1283800713%26sr%3D8-2-fkmr0%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">Nik Silver EFEX Pro</a> is a must have - I like the Photoshop version for many reasons but the Aperture plug-in version works the same way and it is cheaper.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/delta100-pyro.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2332 alignleft" title="delta100-pyro" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/delta100-pyro-300x239.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="239" /></a>Here is a really lousy shot from one of my 9 year old Delta 100 rolls that I found a while back. I have been using it to shoot &#8220;stupid stuff&#8221;. Sort of what I use digital for in a lot of cases. I am a big advocate of shooting stupid stuff. You know - the kind of stuff you know won&#8217;t work but it&#8217;s fun anyway.</p>

<p>Anyway I wanted to demonstrate something regarding Pyro developers that you really have to see for yourself but I find fairly cool. Whenever there are storms coming or going the birds around here get nuts. They fly around and land. Then they explode and go somewhere else. When the wind is blowing they go at like 60 MPH. Hence why they are a little blurry. Anyway - I had a bunch of stupid stuff on this roll and was planning on developing the whole thing at N+ because of the subject matter. Then I shot this - I shot it the same way I would have shot anything else that day, same exposure, meaning the sky was off the charts in terms of brightness and exposure. Heck it was the light source - so I shot the light source at the same exposure you would use for stuff lit by the light source. On my contact sheets it showed up as expected, pure white.</p>

<p>Now here is where the cool part comes in. I still developed the roll at N+ (high contrast) which put the sky in this scene even further into the woods but looking at the negative I could see there was some tonal variations. What to do? I just printed it down and look ma, great differentiation in the clouds. I swear without a lot of attention the sky that day seemed just plain grey with not a bunch of cool clouds. As they say the camera does see more than the eye.</p>

<p>Now this part is where you have to trust me when I say this is what &#8220;they&#8221; are talking about when people rave about highlight differentiation vs other developers. Trust me if you use say&#8230; D-76, which is perfectly fine and put big parts of your image in say zone IX they you over develop it and try to print down or burn in that area what you will end up with is blah grey instead of pure white with not a whole lot of tonal separation. This is why I like pyro developers. I can develop the crap out of the negative for good local contrast (similar to Rodinal) and still be able to print down or burn in highlights with lots of separation. Very cool.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9040276-Version-2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2316" title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9040276-Version-2-300x136.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="136" /></a>I decided to play around and shoot something today that I have never shot before. Butterflies. Nothing special but I did have a purpose. I really wanted to build up my confidence in the E-P1 focusing system from a speed and accuracy standpoint. I am paranoid about such things. Not overly so but I do like to know what to expect and what limitations I am working with. The photo at the top is a crop of the full width of the out of camera jpg. No messing around - settings were &#8220;normal&#8221; all the way around. I did use the choose your own autofocus point but I wasn&#8217;t especially careful. Auto WB and exposure did the heavy lifting. I just got as close as I could without scaring the little critters away. They are a bit more skittish than I imagined.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s the verdict? I would say it is workable. Wouldn&#8217;t you? Take a look at the weather report for the east coast mid-atlantic area today. I shot these with the butterflies moving as normal - they are not dead and with 15 MPH wind knocking both butterfly and branch about. I am right on the water so there really isn&#8217;t any respite from wind to speak of. Just so you don&#8217;t think it was a fluke here are a couple of &#8220;100% crops&#8221;. Strait out of the camera! No shit. I did shoot about 20 images and I would say 90% were fine in terms of focus accuracy and speed. I did blow two or three but I could blame me at least as much as the camera&#8217;s systems. Like I said, you would think this thing is a complete dog when you read the reviews regarding AF speed but if you can&#8217;t nail 90% of things you might want to shoot you are probably pretty much hopeless with any camera.</p>

<p>Does this thing make beautiful JPEG&#8217;s or what?</p>

<p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9040276-Version-3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2317" title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9040276-Version-3-300x240.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="240" /></a></p>

<p>Click on the image to see them in all their pixel peeping glory. Be sure to make sure the lightbox is showing you everything - there is an icon in the upper right corner to see everything if the lightbox is scaling it. These things have been JPG compressed like 4 times each via the camera, export from Aperture, import into Wordpress, and resizing for the small display sizes. Sheesh.</p>
