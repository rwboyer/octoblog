I do believe that that came up in a few comments on the post and I did link them but it looks like they disapeared when my server had a run-in with some lightning a number of weeks ago. Here are a couple of podcasts that I enjoy and can say that I still listen to regularly. Do realize that I am a podcast-aholic, just not attracted to most of the photography or technology subject matter.</p>

I have received so many emails regarding a couple of the Aperture book articles that I have posted recently that I decided to publish a work-around for changing the fonts that I use all the time. I actually like some of the predefined book themes that Aperture ships with but&#8230; hate the default fonts. Instead of monkeying around with manually changing the font styles for every freaking text box in a book there is a fairly simple way to change the fonts with Apertures book themes so that they are completely reusable. You just need to get you hands a little dirty with a few of Aperture&#8217;s inner gears.</p>

I had a conversation the other day with an enthusiastic friend who had just acquired a brand new DSLR upgrade from a P&amp;S digicam and I happened to mention that she would not have to worry as much about the crop anymore when printing to 4x6 paper (as she does most of the time). At that point she asked me what I was talking about. After a long deja vu like conversation and explanation. Here is a thought that I discussed with her that you may find amusing. Namely the insane, idiotic, full circle capture formats and popular consumer print formats have taken in over the decades. Sheet film was invented, paper formats followed, and 8x10, 5x7, and 4x5 prints/frames became popular. Roll film became popular with consumers, some cameras used frames that were appropriate or matched the aspect ratios of existing papers, some didn&#8217;t. 35mm film caught on became much better, consumer photography exploded as did film processing and printing still using the same paper formats that didn&#8217;t match the 35mm 3:2 aspect ratio. A few dozen years ago the 4x6 print size became the most popular final output for consumers and after a long long time consumer capture aspect ratio matched the most popular final output aspect ratio - ahhhhhh peace and harmony.</p>

Lightroom round 9.7. I will try to tackle key-wording (is that a word now?) as quickly and painlessly as possible. First off some quick bottom line kinds of things and then some details. Both applications are so far and away better than older tools that we won&#8217;t even bother to compare them. If you are using either of these and not tagging your images with keywords you should be ashamed of yourself or something. Aperture introduced some ground breaking features with it&#8217;s release way back before Lightroom was around. </div>

Well on with the show. I received way more feedback and questions on my last Aperture quick tip regarding using books for project notes than I would have ever expected. A lot of the feed back was related to using Aperture books for services other than Apple&#8217;s book printing service. After responding to a bunch of very specific questions in email I thought it might be useful to provide a more general overview of how to use Aperture&#8217;s book layout features with any service that you would like to use so here goes.</p>

The question - &#8220;Is there any way to keep notes for a project as a whole&#8221; - sort of like meta data for the whole project. My instant reaction was no but another user posted an idea to use a web journal as a way to keep notes about the project. This is a great idea and I refined it a little bit and posted another response - How about using an aperture book as project notes. This is one of the things I really like about Aperture. No matter how much you use it there is always another way to use it that you may not have thought of. On that note I thought I would share a the book as project notes tip with you.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just added a new feature to the site. The Digg button. Hopefully it&#8217;s not too obtrusive or obnoxious, the button is located at the very end of each article post, only on the post page itself. Check it out. If you find an article useful, informative, entertaining, or enraging - Digg is an easy way to share it with others along with your own comments.</p>

If you ever find yourself in the unenviable position of being on a tight deadline for a wedding, story, commercial client, whatever and you have a problem accessing your Aperture library you only have a few options that are supported by Apple. Option one - recover your entire library from a vault, time machine backup, or other backup if you have one (and you should). </div>

Originally posted in an article about interpretation of histograms, this kind of lighting set up is typical in lighting workshops that I host. Although I feel that this kind of thing is best seen and experienced hands-on, here is my best quick and to the point description of how this particular image was lit.</p>

<p>The main light is to camera right. It is a 3&#8217; x 4&#8217; softbox that positioned very close to the model at about 3&#8217; away just out of the camera frame. It is also as high as I could put it in a room with 9-10&#8217; ceilings, that is the bottom of the box was about waist height. </div>
