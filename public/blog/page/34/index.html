  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/ApertureScreenSnapz005_1.jpg"><img title="ApertureScreenSnapz005_1.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/.thumbs/.ApertureScreenSnapz005_1.jpg" border="0" alt="ApertureScreenSnapz005_1.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="94" align="left" /></a>Until we see Aperture 3 I am going to try to get all you Aperture fans &#8220;ready&#8221; by trying to give you some useful stuff that you may not know or may not have thought about in the version that we all have right now. For some of you it might be a whole lot like getting a new version.</p>

<p>This is a quick one covering something obvious but there are a couple of little hints in here that even you experts might have missed. As you know I am a big fan of stack mode if you have been reading some of my other stuff. Stack mode helps me get to selects really fast. I use compare mode as well but to a much lesser extent and usually use it way down the road in my work-flow to compare very different images.</p>

<p>One of the things that we all need to do is compare similar images - not just overall composition but also images that are very similar compositions in a quick sequence to get to our selects. Aside from an overview we photographers compare detail - usually at 100% - sometimes for sharpness but mostly for subtleties.</p>

<p>The Aperture loupe tool is the worst way to do this. Really it is. The zoom tool (Z key) is the best way. Especially if you are in stack mode or compare mode. Both images get zoomed to 100% and you can drag them around with the space bar. Better yet you can drag them both around at the same time using Shift+Space. Using Z and Shift+Space to compare two images is about 900 times more productive than trying to go back and forth using the loupe.  Try it.</p>

<p>But wait there is more - zooming and shift space works on any number of images in a selection when you have more than one being displayed in the viewer. Yep it works with three or four or&#8230; I do this all the time and it is by far the fastest way to do things in a lot of cases. Esp if you are a shortcut key junkie like I am.</p>

<p>Hold on - we do have one more thing (as Steve would say). You hecklers out there may be saying to yourself - dragging images around zoomed in or using the loupe tool is so slow it sucks. Well you are sort of right but you are actually wrong. You are right if you do not have any idea how to do things effectively in Aperture - If you have a fantastic machine two images with a ton of performance killing adjustments layered on that you want to compare you should be fine. If you want to do it on not so great a machine with those same adjustments it will drag. If you have 4 images up and they have a tone of stuff going on even the biggest machine will be brought to it&#8217;s knees.</p>

<p>So what to do - well that&#8217;s easy instead of complaining over on the Aperture support forum of how bad Aperture sucks because it allows you to ask it to do a lot of work easily - just do it smarter. Even on the lowliest machine this works great. Before you start dragging the images around zoomed in just hit the &#8220;M key&#8221; to disable all the adjustments - drag - hit the M key again - bang no performance lag. Now if you use the menu for everything instead of shortcut keys this would be cumbersome. If you learn to use Aperture well it can be a joy in terms of responsiveness and work-flow productively. So&#8230;</p>

<ol>
    <li>Select images</li>
    <li>Z key</li>
    <li>M key</li>
    <li>Shift+Space drag them</li>
    <li>M key</li>
</ol>


<p>I swear I can be about 4 times as productive even on a 13inch last gen MacBook with Aperture, its shortcuts, and it&#8217;s UI options than I can with Lightroom. If you didn&#8217;t know this or have not thought about it before give it a try and be sure to get used to the shortcuts so they become automatic - I swear it will feel like you got a new machine and a new version of Aperture.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/kylie_bax_helmut_newton.jpg"><img title="kylie_bax_helmut_newton.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/.thumbs/.kylie_bax_helmut_newton.jpg" border="0" alt="kylie_bax_helmut_newton.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="149" height="150" align="left" /></a>One of my all time favorites. My work is heavily influenced by Helmut Newton. Like Salgado (which I admire but is not a giant influence in my own endeavors), when I think I am doing okay - I revisit some of Newtons vast archive of decades of photography. That sets me strait with how much further I have to grow and I get back to work again.</p>

<p>Helmut Newton is one of the few successful commercial photographers that blended his own vision for his art with a commercial commodity with no compromise. You either wanted Newton for your look or you didn&#8217;t. If all you see is fantastically sexy women and men in some gorgeous settings that anyone could shoot you are missing Helmut Newton in a big big way. This guy is fantastically unimaginably good.</p>

<p>Take an in depth look at his work. Again, a book is way better than just surfing the web for a<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/67_Helmut_Newton_TwoPairsOfLegsInBl.jpg"><img title="67_Helmut_Newton_TwoPairsOfLegsInBl.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/.thumbs/.67_Helmut_Newton_TwoPairsOfLegsInBl.jpg" border="0" alt="67_Helmut_Newton_TwoPairsOfLegsInBl.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="140" height="150" align="right" /></a>couple of his more well known images. They are good but they are not even close to being comprehensive or even representative of is vast body of personal, art, and commercial work. Buy a book or six, schedule yourself a few hours on the weekend with a nice bottle of wine and really take some time so see what is going on with this guy&#8217;s images. There is of course the initial wow but what makes this guy so so very good is the depth and complexity of his work with such seemingly simple compositions.</p>

<p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/helmut_newton_008_1975_409x604.jpg"><img title="helmut_newton_008_1975_409x604.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/.thumbs/.helmut_newton_008_1975_409x604.jpg" border="0" alt="helmut_newton_008_1975_409x604.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="102" height="150" align="left" /></a>I don&#8217;t think I have seen a Helmut Newton image that does not exude  lavishness, decadence, privvy, sexuality, and have at least a subtext of fetishistic polarities - pain, pleasure, want, desire, lust, love, tender, harsh. Amazing.</p>

<p>Holy crap his stuff has me sounding like a blabbering art critic or something. I probably own more Helmut Newton monographs than any other photographer. One of my heros.</p>

<p>Enjoy</p>

I thank everyone for their input. I do take it to heart. I have also received some questions about the &#8220;coming soon&#8221; eBooks.</p>

<p>Questions like:</p>

<ul>
    <li>When?</li>
    <li>What happens with Aperture 3?</li>
    <li>What&#8217;s next?</li>
    <li>Can I just get them all with one click?</li>
    <li>If I buy them all can I get a special deal?</li>
</ul>


<p>I am going to let you know where my head is at and if anyone else has some input or suggestions please do not hesitate to chime in. I really want to make them accessible and as good as they can be.</p>

<p>Let me start by saying that I choose the first two subject based on the lack of available information out there on the topics that I covered. The next one will be the same. It will cover some ground on the Aperture Book tool. It will be out in about a week and it will be in the same context of the eBooks so far. It will assume that you have seen the book tool and will not spend a whole lot of time talking about the obvious.</p>

<p>This one was a tough one to keep succinct, cover a lot of ground, and provide some illustrations &amp; examples that should point you in the right direction for getting anything done. The issue that I had with it is that if you try to follow just the words and a few screenshots but are new to Aperture you could get lost. Hence I will be providing some bonus content. First of all, you probably guessed this one - a few screen casts that walk through the examples in the text visually. The other thing is a download or two of technical stuff that I describe but some people may not feel comfortable monkeying with themselves - like automator PDF scripts. So there you have what is coming this week.</p>

<p>As for the other ones. Here is where I am at - I offer these things at a ridiculously low price compared to what is out there (check yourself and let me know if there is a better value - yea right). I do not want to get tangled up with &#8220;upgrades&#8221; and Aperture 3. I feel that the eBooks so far are stand alone and will be extremely helpful no matter what happens with Aperture 3 and changes - some stuff you just gotta know. Of course I will update them for Aperture 3. I may even put something out on Aperture 3 ONLY assuming you have read the other eBooks.</p>

<p>Here is the rub - I have a good feeling that some of the stuff that I have not published yet will probably see the most substantial changes. Adjustments, metadata, and things of that ilk so I am holding off on publishing those for a wee bit. They are pretty much done for Aperture as it sits now but I would feel terrible if Aperture 3 hit next week or next month and I just sold 200 copies of adjustment and metadata eBooks that may be somewhat obsolete - the book stuff, the organization, the file management - we will probably see more but the current paradigm will not be obsolete - it will have additional options and features.</p>

<p>As for multi-eBook purchases. I will probably implement a shopping cart for people that two or three when they are all out but I will probably just keep the prices for all of them extremely low and not do any gimmicky discount crap. It&#8217;s too confusing and too gimmicky for my tastes. The buying pattern so far has been less then 20% of people buy one and immediately buy the other it has been more like 60%+ buy one and then a few days later buy the other one.</p>

<p>Let me know what would be convienient or better for you.</p>

<p>Just wanted to keep everyone up to date - if my thought process is off on this please chime in.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Anybody that cares to offer an opinion or vote please do so. i just put up another test on YouTube. The question I have is if the 720p quality at full screen is &#8220;good enough&#8221; to see what is going on in the screen cast video for mini Aperture tutorials?</p>

<p>The other question I had is the pacing - I am trying to go slow enough so that you can see what is going on but not too too slow. I set this one to a song so that I could gauge how fast I was going and so viewers could has well. All comments and suggestions are welcome and appreciated. Again please select 720p in the menu and watch full screen.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am extremely selective in the previews that I have Aperture generate. For the most part it consists of my top rated images and maybe some other stuff that I use regularly. If you have read some of my work-flow posts or file management eBooks you should know how to control Aperture previews in a lot of different ways. I thought I would share something that I found obvious but surprised a friend of mine the other day when he saw me doing it.</p>

<p>The first thing is that you can use Aperture itself as a media browser for any application that accepts images as drop items. If Aperture has a preview generated - that is what you will get. You can use all of the search functionality and it can sometimes be easier than using the media browser window itself. If you have started to fine tune your preview generation then you might want a couple of ways in Aperture to make sure you are only looking at images that actually have a preview. Since I generate previews for my top rated images I just use that in addition to other search criteria. In some other cases I have an album called previews existing in a project that I use to house images that have previews - that is how I generated them in the first place. I also typically have a smart album for every project that lists top rated images for a lot of purposes. It serves double duty when I am using Aperture as a media browser.</p>

<p>Here is another tip that might surprise you if you haven&#8217;t tried it. The media browser that is opened for ANY application works with any other application. It even works if that target application is not &#8220;media browser enabled&#8221;. What I mean is you can open a media browser for an email message and drop images from it just about anywhere. You can drop them on the desktop, heck you can even drop them in Blurb&#8217;s BookSmart book software and bypass that horrible UI for browsing images that is included. Try it, you&#8217;ll like it.</p>

I interpreted this as an &#8220;art&#8221; project so I suggested the Aperture Book tool.</p>

<p>Instead of explaining it I just did a little tiny video. Actually if I were doing this I would probably zoom the images a bit and skew them as well just so when I put it all together the pieces of paper would be overlapping and crooked when the image was correct.</p>

<p>Enjoy. Be sure to up the resolution to 720p if you watch it large.</p>

I will be offering a new service to help readers that need a little more specific or intensive assistance than a blog comment or an email. A dozen or so people have asked me for this kind of assistance and I have been hesitant to provide it. Actually I have provided it for free. Rather than doing it on a hit or miss basis, trying to schedule it around my &#8220;real&#8221; business I have decided to offer it as a service integrated into my &#8220;real&#8221; business.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s really not new - I do workshops and provide One on One assistance to many photographers that are local to me via workshops and in person help. The new part is that I will be offering it as a remote service to anyone that needs it. What kind of things will I offer? Obviously help with Aperture work-flow, printing, or even problem resolution. The nice part is I am a photographer - not a tech support person so I can provide help with a wide range of photography related topics at the same time. Camera gear. The best way to approach shooting your chosen subject with the gear you have. Making your work-flow more efficient. You name it. All in the context of Apple Aperture or other software that I know if you choose but you know my favorite.</p>

<p>I have struggled with how to make this work well and have landed on what I think will be practical and provide a good value. You contact me via email and tell me what kind of help you need. I respond with how long of a session that will be by my estimate. One hour, or one half hour being typical for focused topics. I also send a schedule of available time slots. You purchase time in 1/2 hour blocks. We set up a remote connection and voice - either you to me or me to you and we do it.</p>

<p>That is simple enough and so far my clinical tests have suggested this is probably the best way to approach this kind of service. If you have any suggestions let me know. If you need help contact me with your needs - that part is free. If I don&#8217;t think a One on One session will be helpful I will be candid and let you know that as well.</p>

<p>If anyone that I have helped One on One in a workshop or locally - feel free to chime in and let people know what you thought.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yep, The site is white. It&#8217;s not you - you did not die and this is some ghostly experience. Something big is coming and it&#8217;s coming tomorrow. Am I talking about Aperture 3? Well maybe we&#8217;ll get Aperture 3 tomorrow but this is not quite that big and it is coming tomorrow. It may not be big to you but it is big for me. It is a commitment from me to offer a couple of services that are very related to Aperture as well as some other topics that are photography related.</p>

<p>Will it cost money you ask. The short answer is yes. The long answer is that it won&#8217;t be a whole lot of money - it will be just right. Enough for me to treat the service seriously and professionally as I do with the &#8220;real&#8221; work I do but not so much that nobody will want it or be able to afford it. I am finishing up the final touches on it and will probably post something later this evening or early tomorrow - This is for sure, so there won&#8217;t be any Aperture 3 guessing games.</p>

<p>About a dozen of you out there know exactly what it is - you asked for it.</p>

<p>On another note - let me know what you think of the white. Do you like the opposite color better? Do you want me to stick with the old traditional RB color scheme after the gala event? Should I stick with this color scheme - is it better for you?</p>

<p>Here is our own little off-year special election that we can vote on without the need for a political argument.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/ApertureVC1.jpg"><img title="ApertureVC1.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/.thumbs/.ApertureVC1.jpg" border="0" alt="ApertureVC1.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="94" align="left" /></a>I just went through an exercise with a reader that was doing all his RAW NEF conversions in Capture One Pro prior to importing into Aperture because the RAW conversion was so much &#8220;better&#8221;. The reality is that Aperture RAW processing is really really good. It just is neutral/flat out of the camera and juiced way way up by default without doing anything &#8220;out of the box&#8221; with Capture One Pro. Really.</p>

<p>Personally I think the default Capture One Pro settings for &#8220;film curve&#8221; and the default sharpening and saturation are way over the top but that first impression kills - doesn&#8217;t it. This became a huge &#8220;issue&#8221; when a lot of people new to photography in general went digital and then went &#8220;serious&#8221; and started shooting RAW - prior to that contrast curve, default edge sharpening, and color saturation were not the gold standard for evaluating RAW conversion quality or image quality. In fact those things get in the way to really evaluate a RAW converter.</p>

<p>To be blunt - all of the major vendor&#8217;s RAW converters here today in 2010 are pretty darn &#8220;good&#8221;. So are the sensors. Apple&#8217;s is actually in the top tier in terms of &#8220;goodness&#8221;. The screen shot at the top is a RAW conversion from a readers D700. The left image is Aperture, the right one is Capture One Pro. I turned the tables on this a bit because I decided to leave the &#8220;default&#8221; curve and saturation blow the whites in Capture One and I turned off the default unsharp mask in Capture One - I meanwhile added three adjustments in about 5 seconds to juice up the Aperture conversion - really less than 5 seconds but any of you could do it in 5 seconds. I further gilded the lilly by adding a very subtile edge sharpen block while leaving the Capture One turned off.</p>

<p>Not really my taste in color, etc. but you can get pretty much anything you want from Aperture&#8217;s<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/ApertureDefault.jpg"><img title="ApertureDefault.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/.thumbs/.ApertureDefault.jpg" border="0" alt="ApertureDefault.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="94" align="right" /></a> RAW converter - save the adjustment as a &#8220;preset&#8221; in an album of presets that you like as a &#8220;default&#8221; and stamp them on your images when imported in like 1.285 seconds. Still way way faster than Capture One Pro that is as slow as a dog. The screen shot in the text is the way the RAW NEF came into Aperture. This is NOT how you evaluate RAW converter &#8220;quality and goodness&#8221;</p>

<p>Ps. F.C. If you want me to take your image down I will just drop me a note.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/DSC0009.jpg"><img title="DSC0009.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/.thumbs/.DSC0009.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC0009.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="99" align="left" /></a>Okay - so I have been like a whining baby that last few days. Let me say a couple of positive things about Apple Aperture as we are winding the week down. The first thing that I want to say is that in my opinion it is still the best photographic tool in it&#8217;s class by a large margin. This doesn&#8217;t mean that it cannot stand some room for improvement. It can but&#8230;</p>

<p>Aperture blows the living crap out of anything else out there in terms of an organizational tool combined with a lot of really really nice RAW processing and adjustment tools. People that complain about it usually have no idea what they are doing. So I will address some of what I complain about with a little context of expecting perfection.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think you have ever heard me complain about Aperture&#8217;s speed - that is because I haven&#8217;t. I run Aperture and have since the beginning with the appropriate hardware and appropriate expectations for the files that I am dealing with and the amount of work that I am asking it to do all at once. I am serious here - try Capture One Pro, or Nikon NX2 and then let me know what you think. Aperture blows the crap out of them in terms of RAW performance. Yeah yeah yeah a bunch of people will chime in about how wonderfully &#8220;fast&#8221; Lightroom is - bullshit.</p>

<p>Here is why it is bullshit. When I first started hearing this from some people and dug into it guess what I found. They were trying to run Aperture on like a first gen white MacBook with intel integrated graphics and a gig of RAM. Yeah right - brilliant. The second thing that I found is that most of this is perception - Aperture lets you do way more - way faster than LR from a workflow perspective. It is easier to ask Aperture to do a lot of work than it is to ask LR to do a lot of work. The third thing that I found is that humans are easily distracted by gee-gaws and shiny objects. When LR is doing a couple of common things ti is actually SLOWER but&#8230; It moves stuff while it is doing it. Aperture doesn&#8217;t. Not faster just no look at me I am doing something while the work is going on.</p>

<p>I know that there are a lot of you that will argue me on this point - I have settled this debate many times in person by challenging various LR users whose primary reason for using LR was &#8220;speed&#8221;. Out of more than a dozen or so such challenges that I went end to end on a real world work-flow (their work-flow) I won. Yes there are a lot of variables in this but who cares - Aperture gets to the end faster. Oh - you don&#8217;t know how to use Aperture, then you are right a much much dumber software will make you faster, maybe.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s move on to RAW processing. I am a Nikon shooter (and a Leaf and a Phase One&#8230;.) I complained about Aperture handling of NEF files. My complaint was exactly the same complaint that I had with ALL other software and I did not start complaining until ACR 5. My complaint was - 1) Handling of WB and 2) No profiles. This was because up until ACR 5 nobody handled it better except Nikon. In reality Aperture&#8217;s RAW processing is about as good as it gets. It is really really good. There is just one extra step that I have to do in a lot of cases. Now that ACR can do it - Apple and everyone else should figure it out. I do have to say that the newer NEF&#8217;s are even better in Aperture than the older NEF files.</p>

<p>Capture One - widely regarded as one of the &#8220;BEST&#8221; RAW converters out there in terms of quality. Compare it to Aperture sometime - Aperture is better in quality in a lot of ways. Apple&#8217;s RAW conversions are actually very very good quality.</p>

<p>On to adjustment tools - Apertures tool set is one of the best out there in terms of usability and capability of very very fine control. Yes the noise reduction is not capable of dealing with horrendous noise. To be blunt this is getting to be more and more moot but if you need really really &#8220;good&#8217; noise reduction you will need a 3rd party no matter what. The rest of the built in tools are fantastic - forget the lame dodge and burn - I do not consider that to be built in. If you end up in PS for a lot of your images then who cares. If you don&#8217;t retouch your images or do effects to them then again who cares. I find LR&#8217;s local adjustments to be a giant pain in the ass to be honest. I end up shooting things to Photoshop in either LR or Aperture.</p>

<p>The most gigantic mistake that Apple made with it&#8217;s built in adjustments are the UI with the levels control - functionally it is pretty much the same as the &#8220;curves&#8221; in Lightroom but nobody in the universe is used to dealing with curves that way. Apple should change that - really, the entire click at the top and play and then click at the bottom and play is not what you want to be doing - it is counter productive because there is no visual feedback to tell you where you want to be when you adjust one of the top and bottom &#8220;quarter tone&#8221; sliders - it takes too much messing with comparde with manipulation of a single point. Okay that was negative but over all it is positive.</p>

<p>The other thing that I noticed was that &#8220;newbies&#8221; didn&#8217;t think that the adjustment controls did &#8220;much&#8221; - I guess that is because they are so used to the exaggerated effects of having sliders that move a tiny little bit in the range and produce HUGE effects. That&#8217;s fantastic - all of the useful range of motion is only 13 pixels wide out of 300. Reminds me of camera dudes<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/DSC0009CapOnePro.jpg"><img title="DSC0009CapOnePro.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/.thumbs/.DSC0009CapOnePro.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC0009CapOnePro.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="99" align="right" /></a>grabbing a lens in a camera store and looking through it and immediately concluding it was &#8220;sharper&#8221; because the focus throw was only about an inch verses a lens with 4 times the focus throw. Yea right.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. That &#8220;crappy&#8221; Aperture NEF RAW conversion is at the top. The one at the bottom is from Capture One Pro V5. Both are &#8220;good&#8221; if not fantastic conversions.</p>
