I chucked up a couple of images that I shot while walking around. The shots were of stairs. Yep you heard that right - stairs. You see I for reasons unknown to me have some really strange compulsion to shoot stairs of all shapes and sizes. I have never made a &#8220;real&#8221; project out of it and am usually ill equipped to shoot them. Even without making it a concerted effort I have about 70 prints that I have made over the years of these images.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t do anything with them. I don&#8217;t hang them up on walls or show them to people. The APUG discussion was a rare exception where I sought out a bunch of people thoughts on which particular similar image they thought was print worthy. Hey I am trying to go green here I don&#8217;t think I want to actually make 3 different prints of the same staircase with different compositions. I didn&#8217;t get an answer - definitively - as to which one was printworthy. There were supporters and detractors of each image. Who would have thought? I guess that didn&#8217;t surprise me, what did surprise me is how many folks have similar secret<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2009_005_22.jpg"><img title="2009_005_22.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2009_005_22.jpg" border="0" alt="2009_005_22.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="100" align="right" /></a> subjects - things that for no particular reason they are compelled to shoot. I am not talking about general things like people or landscapes. I am talking about very specific things like stairs, doors, windows, electric meters, dead trees, you name it. Not just once or for a week but over years and years.</p>

<p>Does every photo enthusiast have that other think that they are <a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2009_005_23.jpg"><img title="2009_005_23.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2009_005_23.jpg" border="0" alt="2009_005_23.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="left" /></a>drawn to shoot? Do you have something like that? Would love to hear what it is. I am sure it would make those of us that have that secret obsession feel a little less strange. The attached images are the latest grabs from a walk I took to warm up the Leica M6 for it&#8217;s come back as my carry around camera. They were shot on Kodak TRI-X and processed in Pyrocat HD.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Leo Patrone looks like he gets a bunch of work. I can see why, he has a great style for weddings. You really should check his work out. If you shoot family pictures just for yourself or professionally you owe it to yourself to get some ideas from this guy. Timeless and classic - meaning not tricky, it&#8217;s all about the people in the pictures. The pictures just get out of the way.</p>

<p><a href="http://leopatronephotography.blogspot.com/">Leo Patrone does classic work</a>. He shoots film. I will bet money that 10 years from now the people that hire this guy will be really happy and continue to cherish this work where the people that hire the latest greatest digital guy that is running all the fad of the moment photoshop actions will more likely cringe when the get a peek of those out of the corner of their eye. I am telling you - all special tricks and wow that looks cool stuff that is so prevalent in a lot of commercial and wedding photography today is tomorrows polyester leisure suit.</p>

<p>This guy uses very simple but nice equipment - A Contax 645 with normal 80mm f2 and Nikon F5&#8217;s with a 50 and an 85. He shoots all his stuff on film AND he processes his own C41. You could probably afford the same state of the art film processor from a few years ago if you had the space for it as well - you may be able to find one for free locally. No shit.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. This guy is not an cranky old guy like me - he is like 26.</p>

I ran across a couple of guys that shoot color film - commercially. In fact they do NO DIGITAL capture. Their work looks great and they use two different labs for processing. They don&#8217;t do this to be arty or even use it in their marketing to be some Â sort of &#8220;retro&#8221;. In fact they claim to have lost a couple of weddings because the clients could not quite understand that they would get digital output as well. Sort of reverse FUD. They claim (as I have predicted previously) that way too many digital photographers produce way too low of quality and way to cheesy effects that may be the wow of the moment but will look like shit in a couple of years. I agree.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.twinlenslife.com/search?q=film+digital">Any way here is one of their sites</a>. Again they use really good film equipment (not as good as mine) but do not spend a ton of money on it. I think the reason the vast majority of casual/amateur photographers switched over to digital, even enthusiasts is due to a couple of factors that are not all that important. The first is that they used shitty labs and got shitty output. Most labs - back when their were a lot of them - sucked. The development sucked and the printing sucked. Today there are some fantastic labs, even the shitty ones give better output than they did but still shitty compared to a great lab and the cost is not really that much different. The other reason is learning - I think amateurs and enthusiasts had a hard time learning with film - especially if they were not involved with processing and printing. If you take what you know now and get a really good lab you might be amazed how good film is and how much better you are.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Maybe this is not news you all of you but McNally&#8217;s assistant just posted something about his workflow. Seems like he uses Aperture for all the organization amongst other things. Guess what the hitch is - he is a Nikon shooter and he does all of his RAW processing in Capture NX2. Given the pain in the ass factor this has to be a giant endorsement for some of Aperture&#8217;s wonderfulness vs. Lightroom and at the same time a giant indictment about Aperture&#8217;s RAW processing on NEF files.</p>

<p>The other thing to note is that McNally (and the guy that does the work) loves the Nik suite of tools. Yep so do I. So much so that if Apple would somehow get the RAW processing straitened out and get into bed with Nik incorporating Viviza local adjustments - or the whole suite into Aperture in a more integrated way. Even if it was the &#8220;smart object&#8221; kind of way (just saving all of the control points file by file and reapplying them when entering the tool again) this would be a game changer in the Aperture v Lightroom competition. I guess what I am saying is take the best out of NX2 and jamb it into Aperture or something thereabouts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/615KQ7TK7TL._SL500_AA240_.jpg"><img title="615KQ7TK7TL._SL500_AA240_.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.615KQ7TK7TL._SL500_AA240_.jpg" border="0" alt="615KQ7TK7TL._SL500_AA240_.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" align="left" /></a>I wanted to share with some of you that my not have experienced Edward Weston&#8217;s Photographs that were one of the inspirations for me when I was young. Some famous some not so famous. These are the primary reason I love black and white photography. From an aesthetic point of view I gravitate much more towards Edward Weston or Seiff or Irving Penn or Richard Avedon than I do Ansel Adams.</p>

<p>If you love photography and have not studied these guys work you really should. A well made book is okay - better than the web but the only way to really experience the breathtaking beauty of the work is to see the real prints. If you are anywhere close to a venue that will allow you to see them I implore you to make the effort. Way back in the day you could schedule time at the National Gallery in Washington DC and actually go downstairs and pull the prints for study up close - not behind glass. I don&#8217;t know if you can still do that but if you can please do so, you owe it to yourself. I spent a week in washington doing this and it change the way I see and think forever. Best of all it is free and the viewing rooms are private - spend all the time you like.</p>

<p>To get a feel for the man look at his work and r<a href="http://www.photoquotes.com/ShowQuotes.aspx?id=51&amp;name=Weston,Edward">ead these quotes - all of them</a>. He is not extremely verbose but these quotes are all very connected in a subtle way - the same way as his work.</p>

<p>Without further delay&#8230; here are some EW photographs.</p>

<p><img title="416414.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/416414.jpg" border="0" alt="416414.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="376" height="480" /></p>

<p>Of course you have all seen the peppers but they are fantastic -</p>

<p><img title="Edward_Weston_Pepper_1930.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Edward_Weston_Pepper_1930.jpg" border="0" alt="Edward_Weston_Pepper_1930.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="315" height="395" /></p>

<p>And the shells - by the way EW was not the first to do the shells by a longshot - It was a favorite subject of still life since the 1890&#8217;s by lots of photographers.</p>

<p><img title="Edward_Weston_Shell_2.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Edward_Weston_Shell_2.jpg" border="0" alt="Edward_Weston_Shell_2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="300" height="381" /></p>

<p>But not like this he definitely made them his own - I have seen an identical composition by a british photographer to the above but the treatment of tonal ranges was inspired completely unlike the other guy.</p>

<p><img title="nautilus_1927.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/nautilus_1927.jpg" border="0" alt="nautilus_1927.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="470" height="600" /></p>

<p>EW did more than just peppers - all of is vegetable stuff was awesome.</p>

<p><img title="1794608674_44d16c82f7.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/1794608674_44d16c82f7.jpg" border="0" alt="1794608674_44d16c82f7.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="500" height="392" /></p>

<p>Fan-f&#8217;ing-tastic. He even did landscapes.</p>

<p><img title="Picture_1_719894.png" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Picture_1_719894.png" border="0" alt="Picture_1_719894.png" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="536" height="418" /></p>

<p>His range of subject matter is not even scratched here, some of the images he did of things like toilets and bedpans were stunning - you have to see the prints to really appreciate them. I think a lot of them were generated by a debate between Weston and a group of Â &#8221;form follows function&#8221; devotes that he thought was idiotic - Weston&#8217;s aesthetic was much more of form is form.</p>

<p><img title="edward_weston_excusado_toilet_19251.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/edward_weston_excusado_toilet_19251.jpg" border="0" alt="edward_weston_excusado_toilet_19251.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="377" height="475" /></p>

<p>Next time you feel like there is nothing to shoot go shoot a fantastically gorgeous image of your toilet, or some vegetables in your icebox. If you don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s tough try to reproduce somethings like this - trust me it is more than a couple of minutes worth of work.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoyed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2000_030_23.jpg"><img title="2000_030_23.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2000_030_23.jpg" border="0" alt="2000_030_23.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="left" /></a>Wanted to follow up on shooting people close to you and having a camera with you. The Leica M is a fantastic camera to carry around with you. Be it M9 or M3. I always had mine with me and have some pretty amazing shots to prove it. A point and shoot digicam is better than nothing but it does a completely different job than the Lieca - really.</p>

<p>This shot is not fantastic and I wished the focus was on the close eye instead of the far eye, etc, etc. but I wanted to use it as an example of real world grab shots - just one in sub optimum conditions. This was in a Friendly&#8217;s restaurant and yes I had my Leica M6. It happened to be loaded with Ilford Delta 100 (actually more like 80 ISO) because I was shooting one of my final calibration rolls that day while walking around. Okay so ISO 80, indoors, what do you think the shutter speed was? I will tell you it was probably like 1/15 at f 2.8. Have you seen your shutter speed indoors at ISO 80 lately?</p>

<p>I am not the steadiest of shooters but I can definitely shoot my Leica at 2 stops maybe 3 lower than I can shoot ANY SLR I have ever owned - really. I can also do it with confidence quickly. The point here is that I picked the camera up and grabbed this shot more quickly than a point and shoot digicam could have charged it&#8217;s flash. Really. Why did I care about this shot? Long story but here is the summary.</p>

<p>Did you notice the band-aid on daughter No. 3&#8217;s hand and the way she is very carefully holding it away from everything including her other fingers? Well 2 days prior to this daughter No. 3 was carrying around one of her favorite objects - a little snow globe that she used to carry around with her blanket constantly since she got it. Her and I were at opposite ends of the kitchen and she dropped it. Before I could get to her - I literally flew across the room - she reached down and grabbed a piece of the broken glass.</p>

<p>Blood, tears, you know the story. Yea I know I am a bad parent for letting her have such a thing. Well it gets worse - the injury was to the thumb that she used as a pacifier to go to sleep. This was major trauma - over the next few days she named it boo-boo summy and eventually made the pacifier transition to the other thumb.</p>

<p>That was a long long time ago but to this day if you ask her to show you boo-boo summy I will bet she will involuntarily lift her hand and show you that thumb in a manner almost exactly like in this picture.</p>

<p>Now I know nobody gives a crap about this picture except me but that is exactly what I am trying to point out - that is the only thing that is important. Am I glad I shot this and other ones on my M vs. a 1 megapix digicam available at that time - YES. Would I have got this shot going from nothing to &#8220;shoot it now&#8221; with a point and shoot digicam even now - NO. Would I have a D3 or D700 and fast lens in a Friendly&#8217;s while not getting paid - definitely not.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just for giggles I have been casually looking at random camera deals on EBay over the last couple of days. No real direction or intent, just things that struck my fancy at the time and some random searches, etc. I cannot believe what you can buy in film cameras of all shapes and sizes for next to nothing now. I need another camera like I need a hole in the head but I may not be able to pass some of this stuff up if I am on the computer at the right time. Heck I could give this stuff away to needy kids or something and they would be shooting higher quality than most of the digital yo-yo&#8217;s spending big bucks.</p>

<p>Check some of these out that I was watching a short time ago. You would need to shoot a hell of a lot of film to make up for the cost of a high end digital:</p>

<p>An Olympus OM4 that looks like it was never used - you know the kind of guy who uses a never-ready case kind of owner. These things were totally fantastic cameras and really small and light as well. This one came with a nice lens for $162.50. WTF?</p>

<p><a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=320434373979&amp;ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT#ht_500wt_1024">Olympus OM4</a></p>

<p>How about a decent condition Nikon FM with a 55mm Micro for $89. Not quite as small or as good cosmetics as the Olympus but still small and light and a true joy to use.</p>

<p><a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=370273256525&amp;ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT#ht_4366wt_909">Nikon FM</a></p>

<p>Okay want some real durability, mechanical precision, and something you could kill somebody with and it will still work. How about a gorgeous - fantastically good condition Nikon F2A with a 55mm Micro for $226. These have a special place in my heart and are semi collector items that is why the price double in the last 2 seconds of the auction. But $226?</p>

<p><a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=320434386762&amp;ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT#ht_500wt_924">Nikon F2A</a></p>

<p>Want something a bit more modern with a little more panache? How about a brand new looking Contax G2 with the one and only true rangefinder zoom lens on the planet for $664? I had a G2 and every single lens made for it for about a year but decided I liked my Leicas better. These things are great cameras and the lens collection is amazing as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=230386911759&amp;ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT">Contax G2</a></p>

<p>Sticking with the Contax - holy shit a brand newish looking Contax RTS with a Zeiss zoom for $100.99.</p>

<p><a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=320434392783&amp;ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT#ht_500wt_924">Contax RTS</a></p>

<p>All of these cameras are amazing and capable of fantastic results. They will probably make better pictures that your current DSLR and are a joy to use, hold, and behold. Add a classic well damped fast prime or so - Olympus, Zeiss, Nikon, or even a Zeiss in Nikon mount and you will be good to go. Hell you can pretend you were a rich professional when only the top notch pros could afford stuff like this. The Leica and Hasselblad stuff goes for bigger numbers but still cheap compared to acquiring it when everyone was shooting film.</p>

<p>Just something to think about. Know some kid that is into photography? - buy him/her one of these with a brick of film and mailers instead of a plastic crappy cam. With decent processing and scanning the results should amaze his/her friends. The really funny thing is this stuff will still be useable even when you would never consider shooting the digicam that you buy this year brand new. Funny stuff.</p>

<p>I swear the very next time somebody asks me for camera advice I am going to find out what they want to make with their images - my answer is going to be.</p>

<p>Web and looking at them on your laptop = cheap digital.</p>

<p>Make prints, books, posters, movies, projection HD quality slide shows - used fantastic film gear.</p>

<p>Here is a secret - If you want good quality and good images you have to spend time on it no matter what the medium. You have to work at it. If you don&#8217;t want to work at it, then it will not matter and digital will be easier and you can be lazier. If you do want to work at it digital does not a whole lot but save you some wait time before you can see your images.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2000_032_23.jpg"><img title="2000_032_23.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2000_032_23.jpg" border="0" alt="2000_032_23.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="100" align="left" /></a>I have had a lot of conversations via email and even a couple over the phone/skype regarding my relatively recent push for people to shoot film. I wanted to share some of the thoughts that I have had and some realizations regarding those conversations. The very first thought and clarification is that I love digital - I really really do but I do not think that digital capture is the only way to go. In fact I really think that for most people it is not the way to go, at least not all the time.</p>

<p>Digital is a huge deal when it comes to actually making things. Making things like fantastic video or other projected presentation of your photographs. Making things like really nice books - nice and inexpensive - way more inexpensive than custom prints from the chemical output age. If you want to spend some money on your best stuff after refining and editing and refining your concept some more you can get books make that will blow your mind in terms of quality level. I am not talking about blurb or any of the HP Indigo stuff. Hit me up if you want some companies that I have seen output from. And when it comes to printing the quality, size, and materials that you can make at home or have made for you is absolutely amazing - color or black and white.</p>

<p>Digital is great for actually making things - things with quality that you could not even dream of affording 20 years ago. Forget $30,000 for a capture device that has nothing to do with making really nice stuff. 20 years ago you couldn&#8217;t afford the equipment or the services to actually make something out of your photographs that were amazing - that is the real revolution here. The gigantic equalizer is digital output and making really cool stuff. Want to make a magazine - try MagCloud.com - if it take off and is great get a better printer and up the quality of output. This has absolutely nothing to do with your capture device.</p>

<p>It really saddens me that so many people do not actually make things with their photographs - not even albums of 4x6 machine prints like they did just a short while ago. Instead they are all caught up thinking that they need an $8,000 camera or a $30,000 camera to compete or stay up to date or produce fantastic quality. This is ridiculous. I assure you that a nice $2000 or even $500 medium format kit with 100 speed slide film or actually just about any film with a decent scan will put you miles ahead of the $8000 camera and on par with the $30,000 camera. If you are commercial photographer and the savings in labor, film, processing, turnaround, whatever are actually going to pay for itself inside a couple of months and make you more expense efficient or tangibly more competitive - sure go for it. It is probably a small part of your studios budget anyway. If you shoot for a news service sure go for it.</p>

<p>If you do this for the love of it and want to up your quality game substantially get some film and some fantastic film gear for cheap - the same stuff that was blowing the minds of people 10 years ago for virtually nothing and actually make some really really cool stuff via digital hybrid process that there is no way you could have afforded 10 years ago. I am dead serious. This is why I sold my D3 cameras and have not replaced them yet. Do I use digital cameras - sure, I probably always will but I also use film cameras. I haven&#8217;t shot 35mm film in a while but I am going to because I really really like using my M series and want to see if it makes any sense at all to plunk down $7,000 on one that had digital output. I have always shot medium format film - not constantly but for some jobs and some personal stuff I never stopped. I have also shot medium format digital, I only purchased one digital back for my medium format kit and it is long obsolete, I have rented them occasionally but until it makes any sense at all for either my volume or some yet to occur project needs I will probably not buy one again. That does not mean I do not think that some of the latest stuff is not fantastic, it is. Just not applicable for any of my current needs.</p>

<p>I guess the bottom line is digital is great in a lot of ways - mostly in making stuff - as in final product. Digital capture on the other hand is usually not the best way to go unless there is a really really good reason. If all you want to make are email images and a web gallery or two film makes no sense - neither does a D3X or a Lieca M9. If you want to make fantastic stuff, figure out what you want to make and grab your self tools that will do the job. Most likely that will probably be what you already have or if you want to up the quality level - a level of film gear that you could never have afforded 10 years ago.</p>

<p>Quick story - my mom. My mom is not a good photographer but she does have a good eye. Every once in a while she makes an amazing image on her Nikon digital point and shoot. Not just from her point of view but my very critical eye as well. Usually when this happens she wants me to make a print for her. With out fail I say to myself NOT - I wish she had more megapixels in her point and shoot, NOT I wish she had a D3x. To be honest I think to myself - I wish she would have shot this on her olympus stylus on film (a camera I gave her like 10 years ago), fantastic little camera, great 2.8 lens, and if she would have had it loaded with like Kodak Ektar 100 or whatever 100 speed film the walmart was selling it would go from really great image - too bad it looks like shit blown up to 11x14 - wow fantastic print.</p>

<p>No shit - I am serious. She doesn&#8217;t care but I do.</p>

<p>Just want to leave you with this link - A real honest to goodness photojournalist that still uses film today - film and digital but definitely film. Here is <a href="http://www.alanschin.com/projects.html">Alan Chin&#8217;s site</a>. I will post more of these as I run across these guys.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2009_003_25.jpg"><img title="2009_003_25.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2009_003_25.jpg" border="0" alt="2009_003_25.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="100" align="left" /></a>Someone was seeking some advice regarding the Leica M9 and shooting his kids in one of the post comments a while back. I thought I would share some of the images from that last roll of eight year old Kodak Tri-X that I developed a couple of days ago. The images in the original post and these were some of the the images on that roll.</p>

<p>Personally I believe that shooting your kids, your brother&#8217;s, sister&#8217;s, and neighbor&#8217;s kids is probably one of the most &#8220;important&#8221; and &#8220;valuable&#8221; things you will ever shoot. You can make money doing just about any job - not just photography jobs but when it comes down to what you point your camera at - your kids and people that are close to you, or their kids, will probably be the most important in the long run. Some of the best and most appreciated gifts I have ever given anyone were images of their children. Not for money - just gifts. Unlike other commercial photographers I actually have shot tens of thousands of<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2009_003_15.jpg"><img title="2009_003_15.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2009_003_15.jpg" border="0" alt="2009_003_15.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="right" /></a> images of my children. I think I am pretty good at it. So do other commercial photographer friends of mine - they have begged me to shoot their kids - mostly because they don&#8217;t. Shooting kids is really hard and most images of kids really suck.</p>

<p>So what about the Leica M and kids? I believe it is a fabulous tool to shoot kids and all people for that matter. These are pretty much some strait scans off of that eight year old roll of daughter No. 3 playing in a puddle. They are not the best images that I have ever made of her but I am glad I made them. I have similar stuff all shot with a Leica M6 - mostly with a 50mm Summicron. If you want to shoot your kids in a football or baseball game from the stands or sidelines the M series is not going to cut it. If you <a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2009_003_22.jpg"><img title="2009_003_22.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2009_003_22.jpg" border="0" alt="2009_003_22.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="left" /></a>want something that you will always have with you and can shoot fast with confidence the M series is great. Would I want to carry around my Nikon SLR gear with a fast zoom all the time - hell no. In addition to having it with you, it also is very unobtrusive - even with kids this seems to matter.</p>

<p>So I guess my answer to the Leica M9 and kids would be - Yes it is fantastic for shooting kids. What do you think? Do you want to shoot everyday situations like daughter No. 3 playing in a puddle? If yes the M series will do the job, maybe better than your DSLR and definitely better than your point and shoot. Assuming that you put<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2009_003_09.jpg"><img title="2009_003_09.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2009_003_09.jpg" border="0" alt="2009_003_09.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="100" align="right" /></a> in the effort to learn how to use it.</p>

<p>I actually think some of these long lost images may have some potential with a little dodging and burning and a slight crop here and there. What do you think? I hope that sharing some of the random non-perfect stuff that I point my camera at is at all informative to you.</p>
