I ran across a couple of guys that shoot color film - commercially. In fact they do NO DIGITAL capture. Their work looks great and they use two different labs for processing. They don&#8217;t do this to be arty or even use it in their marketing to be some Â sort of &#8220;retro&#8221;. In fact they claim to have lost a couple of weddings because the clients could not quite understand that they would get digital output as well. Sort of reverse FUD. They claim (as I have predicted previously) that way too many digital photographers produce way too low of quality and way to cheesy effects that may be the wow of the moment but will look like shit in a couple of years. I agree.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.twinlenslife.com/search?q=film+digital">Any way here is one of their sites</a>. Again they use really good film equipment (not as good as mine) but do not spend a ton of money on it. I think the reason the vast majority of casual/amateur photographers switched over to digital, even enthusiasts is due to a couple of factors that are not all that important. The first is that they used shitty labs and got shitty output. Most labs - back when their were a lot of them - sucked. The development sucked and the printing sucked. Today there are some fantastic labs, even the shitty ones give better output than they did but still shitty compared to a great lab and the cost is not really that much different. The other reason is learning - I think amateurs and enthusiasts had a hard time learning with film - especially if they were not involved with processing and printing. If you take what you know now and get a really good lab you might be amazed how good film is and how much better you are.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Maybe this is not news you all of you but McNally&#8217;s assistant just posted something about his workflow. Seems like he uses Aperture for all the organization amongst other things. Guess what the hitch is - he is a Nikon shooter and he does all of his RAW processing in Capture NX2. Given the pain in the ass factor this has to be a giant endorsement for some of Aperture&#8217;s wonderfulness vs. Lightroom and at the same time a giant indictment about Aperture&#8217;s RAW processing on NEF files.</p>

<p>The other thing to note is that McNally (and the guy that does the work) loves the Nik suite of tools. Yep so do I. So much so that if Apple would somehow get the RAW processing straitened out and get into bed with Nik incorporating Viviza local adjustments - or the whole suite into Aperture in a more integrated way. Even if it was the &#8220;smart object&#8221; kind of way (just saving all of the control points file by file and reapplying them when entering the tool again) this would be a game changer in the Aperture v Lightroom competition. I guess what I am saying is take the best out of NX2 and jamb it into Aperture or something thereabouts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/615KQ7TK7TL._SL500_AA240_.jpg"><img title="615KQ7TK7TL._SL500_AA240_.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.615KQ7TK7TL._SL500_AA240_.jpg" border="0" alt="615KQ7TK7TL._SL500_AA240_.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="150" align="left" /></a>I wanted to share with some of you that my not have experienced Edward Weston&#8217;s Photographs that were one of the inspirations for me when I was young. Some famous some not so famous. These are the primary reason I love black and white photography. From an aesthetic point of view I gravitate much more towards Edward Weston or Seiff or Irving Penn or Richard Avedon than I do Ansel Adams.</p>

<p>If you love photography and have not studied these guys work you really should. A well made book is okay - better than the web but the only way to really experience the breathtaking beauty of the work is to see the real prints. If you are anywhere close to a venue that will allow you to see them I implore you to make the effort. Way back in the day you could schedule time at the National Gallery in Washington DC and actually go downstairs and pull the prints for study up close - not behind glass. I don&#8217;t know if you can still do that but if you can please do so, you owe it to yourself. I spent a week in washington doing this and it change the way I see and think forever. Best of all it is free and the viewing rooms are private - spend all the time you like.</p>

<p>To get a feel for the man look at his work and r<a href="http://www.photoquotes.com/ShowQuotes.aspx?id=51&amp;name=Weston,Edward">ead these quotes - all of them</a>. He is not extremely verbose but these quotes are all very connected in a subtle way - the same way as his work.</p>

<p>Without further delay&#8230; here are some EW photographs.</p>

<p><img title="416414.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/416414.jpg" border="0" alt="416414.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="376" height="480" /></p>

<p>Of course you have all seen the peppers but they are fantastic -</p>

<p><img title="Edward_Weston_Pepper_1930.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Edward_Weston_Pepper_1930.jpg" border="0" alt="Edward_Weston_Pepper_1930.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="315" height="395" /></p>

<p>And the shells - by the way EW was not the first to do the shells by a longshot - It was a favorite subject of still life since the 1890&#8217;s by lots of photographers.</p>

<p><img title="Edward_Weston_Shell_2.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Edward_Weston_Shell_2.jpg" border="0" alt="Edward_Weston_Shell_2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="300" height="381" /></p>

<p>But not like this he definitely made them his own - I have seen an identical composition by a british photographer to the above but the treatment of tonal ranges was inspired completely unlike the other guy.</p>

<p><img title="nautilus_1927.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/nautilus_1927.jpg" border="0" alt="nautilus_1927.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="470" height="600" /></p>

<p>EW did more than just peppers - all of is vegetable stuff was awesome.</p>

<p><img title="1794608674_44d16c82f7.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/1794608674_44d16c82f7.jpg" border="0" alt="1794608674_44d16c82f7.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="500" height="392" /></p>

<p>Fan-f&#8217;ing-tastic. He even did landscapes.</p>

<p><img title="Picture_1_719894.png" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Picture_1_719894.png" border="0" alt="Picture_1_719894.png" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="536" height="418" /></p>

<p>His range of subject matter is not even scratched here, some of the images he did of things like toilets and bedpans were stunning - you have to see the prints to really appreciate them. I think a lot of them were generated by a debate between Weston and a group of Â &#8221;form follows function&#8221; devotes that he thought was idiotic - Weston&#8217;s aesthetic was much more of form is form.</p>

<p><img title="edward_weston_excusado_toilet_19251.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/edward_weston_excusado_toilet_19251.jpg" border="0" alt="edward_weston_excusado_toilet_19251.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="377" height="475" /></p>

<p>Next time you feel like there is nothing to shoot go shoot a fantastically gorgeous image of your toilet, or some vegetables in your icebox. If you don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s tough try to reproduce somethings like this - trust me it is more than a couple of minutes worth of work.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoyed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2000_030_23.jpg"><img title="2000_030_23.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2000_030_23.jpg" border="0" alt="2000_030_23.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="left" /></a>Wanted to follow up on shooting people close to you and having a camera with you. The Leica M is a fantastic camera to carry around with you. Be it M9 or M3. I always had mine with me and have some pretty amazing shots to prove it. A point and shoot digicam is better than nothing but it does a completely different job than the Lieca - really.</p>

<p>This shot is not fantastic and I wished the focus was on the close eye instead of the far eye, etc, etc. but I wanted to use it as an example of real world grab shots - just one in sub optimum conditions. This was in a Friendly&#8217;s restaurant and yes I had my Leica M6. It happened to be loaded with Ilford Delta 100 (actually more like 80 ISO) because I was shooting one of my final calibration rolls that day while walking around. Okay so ISO 80, indoors, what do you think the shutter speed was? I will tell you it was probably like 1/15 at f 2.8. Have you seen your shutter speed indoors at ISO 80 lately?</p>

<p>I am not the steadiest of shooters but I can definitely shoot my Leica at 2 stops maybe 3 lower than I can shoot ANY SLR I have ever owned - really. I can also do it with confidence quickly. The point here is that I picked the camera up and grabbed this shot more quickly than a point and shoot digicam could have charged it&#8217;s flash. Really. Why did I care about this shot? Long story but here is the summary.</p>

<p>Did you notice the band-aid on daughter No. 3&#8217;s hand and the way she is very carefully holding it away from everything including her other fingers? Well 2 days prior to this daughter No. 3 was carrying around one of her favorite objects - a little snow globe that she used to carry around with her blanket constantly since she got it. Her and I were at opposite ends of the kitchen and she dropped it. Before I could get to her - I literally flew across the room - she reached down and grabbed a piece of the broken glass.</p>

<p>Blood, tears, you know the story. Yea I know I am a bad parent for letting her have such a thing. Well it gets worse - the injury was to the thumb that she used as a pacifier to go to sleep. This was major trauma - over the next few days she named it boo-boo summy and eventually made the pacifier transition to the other thumb.</p>

<p>That was a long long time ago but to this day if you ask her to show you boo-boo summy I will bet she will involuntarily lift her hand and show you that thumb in a manner almost exactly like in this picture.</p>

<p>Now I know nobody gives a crap about this picture except me but that is exactly what I am trying to point out - that is the only thing that is important. Am I glad I shot this and other ones on my M vs. a 1 megapix digicam available at that time - YES. Would I have got this shot going from nothing to &#8220;shoot it now&#8221; with a point and shoot digicam even now - NO. Would I have a D3 or D700 and fast lens in a Friendly&#8217;s while not getting paid - definitely not.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just for giggles I have been casually looking at random camera deals on EBay over the last couple of days. No real direction or intent, just things that struck my fancy at the time and some random searches, etc. I cannot believe what you can buy in film cameras of all shapes and sizes for next to nothing now. I need another camera like I need a hole in the head but I may not be able to pass some of this stuff up if I am on the computer at the right time. Heck I could give this stuff away to needy kids or something and they would be shooting higher quality than most of the digital yo-yo&#8217;s spending big bucks.</p>

<p>Check some of these out that I was watching a short time ago. You would need to shoot a hell of a lot of film to make up for the cost of a high end digital:</p>

<p>An Olympus OM4 that looks like it was never used - you know the kind of guy who uses a never-ready case kind of owner. These things were totally fantastic cameras and really small and light as well. This one came with a nice lens for $162.50. WTF?</p>

<p><a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=320434373979&amp;ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT#ht_500wt_1024">Olympus OM4</a></p>

<p>How about a decent condition Nikon FM with a 55mm Micro for $89. Not quite as small or as good cosmetics as the Olympus but still small and light and a true joy to use.</p>

<p><a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=370273256525&amp;ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT#ht_4366wt_909">Nikon FM</a></p>

<p>Okay want some real durability, mechanical precision, and something you could kill somebody with and it will still work. How about a gorgeous - fantastically good condition Nikon F2A with a 55mm Micro for $226. These have a special place in my heart and are semi collector items that is why the price double in the last 2 seconds of the auction. But $226?</p>

<p><a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=320434386762&amp;ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT#ht_500wt_924">Nikon F2A</a></p>

<p>Want something a bit more modern with a little more panache? How about a brand new looking Contax G2 with the one and only true rangefinder zoom lens on the planet for $664? I had a G2 and every single lens made for it for about a year but decided I liked my Leicas better. These things are great cameras and the lens collection is amazing as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=230386911759&amp;ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT">Contax G2</a></p>

<p>Sticking with the Contax - holy shit a brand newish looking Contax RTS with a Zeiss zoom for $100.99.</p>

<p><a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=320434392783&amp;ssPageName=STRK:MEWAX:IT#ht_500wt_924">Contax RTS</a></p>

<p>All of these cameras are amazing and capable of fantastic results. They will probably make better pictures that your current DSLR and are a joy to use, hold, and behold. Add a classic well damped fast prime or so - Olympus, Zeiss, Nikon, or even a Zeiss in Nikon mount and you will be good to go. Hell you can pretend you were a rich professional when only the top notch pros could afford stuff like this. The Leica and Hasselblad stuff goes for bigger numbers but still cheap compared to acquiring it when everyone was shooting film.</p>

<p>Just something to think about. Know some kid that is into photography? - buy him/her one of these with a brick of film and mailers instead of a plastic crappy cam. With decent processing and scanning the results should amaze his/her friends. The really funny thing is this stuff will still be useable even when you would never consider shooting the digicam that you buy this year brand new. Funny stuff.</p>

<p>I swear the very next time somebody asks me for camera advice I am going to find out what they want to make with their images - my answer is going to be.</p>

<p>Web and looking at them on your laptop = cheap digital.</p>

<p>Make prints, books, posters, movies, projection HD quality slide shows - used fantastic film gear.</p>

<p>Here is a secret - If you want good quality and good images you have to spend time on it no matter what the medium. You have to work at it. If you don&#8217;t want to work at it, then it will not matter and digital will be easier and you can be lazier. If you do want to work at it digital does not a whole lot but save you some wait time before you can see your images.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2000_032_23.jpg"><img title="2000_032_23.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2000_032_23.jpg" border="0" alt="2000_032_23.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="100" align="left" /></a>I have had a lot of conversations via email and even a couple over the phone/skype regarding my relatively recent push for people to shoot film. I wanted to share some of the thoughts that I have had and some realizations regarding those conversations. The very first thought and clarification is that I love digital - I really really do but I do not think that digital capture is the only way to go. In fact I really think that for most people it is not the way to go, at least not all the time.</p>

<p>Digital is a huge deal when it comes to actually making things. Making things like fantastic video or other projected presentation of your photographs. Making things like really nice books - nice and inexpensive - way more inexpensive than custom prints from the chemical output age. If you want to spend some money on your best stuff after refining and editing and refining your concept some more you can get books make that will blow your mind in terms of quality level. I am not talking about blurb or any of the HP Indigo stuff. Hit me up if you want some companies that I have seen output from. And when it comes to printing the quality, size, and materials that you can make at home or have made for you is absolutely amazing - color or black and white.</p>

<p>Digital is great for actually making things - things with quality that you could not even dream of affording 20 years ago. Forget $30,000 for a capture device that has nothing to do with making really nice stuff. 20 years ago you couldn&#8217;t afford the equipment or the services to actually make something out of your photographs that were amazing - that is the real revolution here. The gigantic equalizer is digital output and making really cool stuff. Want to make a magazine - try MagCloud.com - if it take off and is great get a better printer and up the quality of output. This has absolutely nothing to do with your capture device.</p>

<p>It really saddens me that so many people do not actually make things with their photographs - not even albums of 4x6 machine prints like they did just a short while ago. Instead they are all caught up thinking that they need an $8,000 camera or a $30,000 camera to compete or stay up to date or produce fantastic quality. This is ridiculous. I assure you that a nice $2000 or even $500 medium format kit with 100 speed slide film or actually just about any film with a decent scan will put you miles ahead of the $8000 camera and on par with the $30,000 camera. If you are commercial photographer and the savings in labor, film, processing, turnaround, whatever are actually going to pay for itself inside a couple of months and make you more expense efficient or tangibly more competitive - sure go for it. It is probably a small part of your studios budget anyway. If you shoot for a news service sure go for it.</p>

<p>If you do this for the love of it and want to up your quality game substantially get some film and some fantastic film gear for cheap - the same stuff that was blowing the minds of people 10 years ago for virtually nothing and actually make some really really cool stuff via digital hybrid process that there is no way you could have afforded 10 years ago. I am dead serious. This is why I sold my D3 cameras and have not replaced them yet. Do I use digital cameras - sure, I probably always will but I also use film cameras. I haven&#8217;t shot 35mm film in a while but I am going to because I really really like using my M series and want to see if it makes any sense at all to plunk down $7,000 on one that had digital output. I have always shot medium format film - not constantly but for some jobs and some personal stuff I never stopped. I have also shot medium format digital, I only purchased one digital back for my medium format kit and it is long obsolete, I have rented them occasionally but until it makes any sense at all for either my volume or some yet to occur project needs I will probably not buy one again. That does not mean I do not think that some of the latest stuff is not fantastic, it is. Just not applicable for any of my current needs.</p>

<p>I guess the bottom line is digital is great in a lot of ways - mostly in making stuff - as in final product. Digital capture on the other hand is usually not the best way to go unless there is a really really good reason. If all you want to make are email images and a web gallery or two film makes no sense - neither does a D3X or a Lieca M9. If you want to make fantastic stuff, figure out what you want to make and grab your self tools that will do the job. Most likely that will probably be what you already have or if you want to up the quality level - a level of film gear that you could never have afforded 10 years ago.</p>

<p>Quick story - my mom. My mom is not a good photographer but she does have a good eye. Every once in a while she makes an amazing image on her Nikon digital point and shoot. Not just from her point of view but my very critical eye as well. Usually when this happens she wants me to make a print for her. With out fail I say to myself NOT - I wish she had more megapixels in her point and shoot, NOT I wish she had a D3x. To be honest I think to myself - I wish she would have shot this on her olympus stylus on film (a camera I gave her like 10 years ago), fantastic little camera, great 2.8 lens, and if she would have had it loaded with like Kodak Ektar 100 or whatever 100 speed film the walmart was selling it would go from really great image - too bad it looks like shit blown up to 11x14 - wow fantastic print.</p>

<p>No shit - I am serious. She doesn&#8217;t care but I do.</p>

<p>Just want to leave you with this link - A real honest to goodness photojournalist that still uses film today - film and digital but definitely film. Here is <a href="http://www.alanschin.com/projects.html">Alan Chin&#8217;s site</a>. I will post more of these as I run across these guys.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2009_003_25.jpg"><img title="2009_003_25.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2009_003_25.jpg" border="0" alt="2009_003_25.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="100" align="left" /></a>Someone was seeking some advice regarding the Leica M9 and shooting his kids in one of the post comments a while back. I thought I would share some of the images from that last roll of eight year old Kodak Tri-X that I developed a couple of days ago. The images in the original post and these were some of the the images on that roll.</p>

<p>Personally I believe that shooting your kids, your brother&#8217;s, sister&#8217;s, and neighbor&#8217;s kids is probably one of the most &#8220;important&#8221; and &#8220;valuable&#8221; things you will ever shoot. You can make money doing just about any job - not just photography jobs but when it comes down to what you point your camera at - your kids and people that are close to you, or their kids, will probably be the most important in the long run. Some of the best and most appreciated gifts I have ever given anyone were images of their children. Not for money - just gifts. Unlike other commercial photographers I actually have shot tens of thousands of<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2009_003_15.jpg"><img title="2009_003_15.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2009_003_15.jpg" border="0" alt="2009_003_15.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="right" /></a> images of my children. I think I am pretty good at it. So do other commercial photographer friends of mine - they have begged me to shoot their kids - mostly because they don&#8217;t. Shooting kids is really hard and most images of kids really suck.</p>

<p>So what about the Leica M and kids? I believe it is a fabulous tool to shoot kids and all people for that matter. These are pretty much some strait scans off of that eight year old roll of daughter No. 3 playing in a puddle. They are not the best images that I have ever made of her but I am glad I made them. I have similar stuff all shot with a Leica M6 - mostly with a 50mm Summicron. If you want to shoot your kids in a football or baseball game from the stands or sidelines the M series is not going to cut it. If you <a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2009_003_22.jpg"><img title="2009_003_22.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2009_003_22.jpg" border="0" alt="2009_003_22.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="left" /></a>want something that you will always have with you and can shoot fast with confidence the M series is great. Would I want to carry around my Nikon SLR gear with a fast zoom all the time - hell no. In addition to having it with you, it also is very unobtrusive - even with kids this seems to matter.</p>

<p>So I guess my answer to the Leica M9 and kids would be - Yes it is fantastic for shooting kids. What do you think? Do you want to shoot everyday situations like daughter No. 3 playing in a puddle? If yes the M series will do the job, maybe better than your DSLR and definitely better than your point and shoot. Assuming that you put<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2009_003_09.jpg"><img title="2009_003_09.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2009_003_09.jpg" border="0" alt="2009_003_09.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="100" align="right" /></a> in the effort to learn how to use it.</p>

<p>I actually think some of these long lost images may have some potential with a little dodging and burning and a slight crop here and there. What do you think? I hope that sharing some of the random non-perfect stuff that I point my camera at is at all informative to you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A short while ago I wrote something about image magnification, film scanning, sharpening etc. The <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2009/10/02/megapixels-image-magnification-and-why-you-probably-dont-need-a-new-camera/">original post</a> was making a point that looking at some of the unsharpened film scans at 100% that I presented while discussing various characteristics of film has nothing to do with image sharpness on the film, in any reasonable sized print, or in comparison with any DX/FX sized camera sensor available.</p>

<p>I also made a point that consumer digital capture has a long way to go and may never get to a place that is easy to get with medium format film. The point that I was making was not anything aesthetic, although I could argue about that as well, the point was all about image magnification and why lower image magnification = better. The way that I explained it caused some confusion and conversation with a couple of readers so I thought I might try to clarify the whole image magnification thing one more time.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s forget about pixels for a second and talk just about the size of the capture medium vs the size of the final output product. If you have an FX or 35mm sized capture device, be it digital or film, and make an 8 inch wide print that corresponds to the short side of your sensor the magnification will be about 8x - end of story. This is because the short side of that capture medium is about 1&#8221; by 1.5&#8221; Â on the long end (not being exact, just making things simple), hence if you make it 8 inches that will be 8 times as big. Very simple. Let&#8217;s say that your capture medium is perfect - your sensor or film has no flaws. Every other flaw in the image making process will be magnified by 8x - movement, vibration, imperfect focus, lens flaws, etc. etc. Yes I know that movement and vibration are affected by focal magnification as well but all else being equal they will all be magnified by that amount. Also realize that there is no such thing as depth of field when talking about perfect focus - there is exactly right focus and varying degrees of out of focus. The more the magnification the more you can see them - yes the &#8220;varying degrees of out of focus&#8221; also depends on aperture but at the end of the day what is acceptable depth of field is also governed by image magnification.</p>

<p>Here is the part where I confused some people in my original post. I brought pixels and dpi into the conversation. The only thing that pixels and dpi have to do with anything related to image magnification is when you also start talking about viewing at &#8220;100%&#8221; on your output medium. This is what everybody does to judge image quality, they view all of the pixels at a one to one ratio with their screen - 100%. So let us bring megapixels into our little example - say I have a Nikon D3 12 megapixel camera with an FX sized sensor and I view it at 100%. Assuming you and I have a normal modern monitor we have an output device that is really close to 100 pixels per inch. So we are now going to be viewing 2,832 pixels at 100 pixels per inch or&#8230; something 28 inches tall - just a section of it. Using our 3rd grade math skills that would be an image magnification of, hmmmm 28x.</p>

<p>Are we good so far? That 28x is like really, really microscope-ish. To tell you the truth things really start to fall apart at a close viewing distance at maybe 10x or 15x - if you are far away they will still be fine but close up they fall apart. Now let&#8217;s say that we keep the same lenses, and more importantly the same shooting technique and conditions. Same flash units whatever but we buy ourselves a brand spanking new Nikon D3x with a small size pixel dimension of Â 4,032. Woo hoooo our stuff is going to be so much better - wrong. It will probably be about the same but now when we go look at it at 100% we get to see it at 40x magnification - gee golly. Now we are well into microscope territory and I can bet you your focus sucks, autofocus sucks, your lenses suck - oh and your shooting technique and conditions really really suck at 40x.</p>

<p>When you are getting more megapixels you are getting the ability to magnify more with out your pixels turning into squares but you are doing nothing about the magnification factor that will always be a killer depending on your output intent and viewing distances. Hey if you are a hundred yards away you can output billboard sized stuff and it will look fantastic. Now if we get back into practical sized stuff that we deal with close up - how big do you want to go and how good do you want it to look. Just about anything looks great at 4x and below, I really do mean just about anything. Reasonably competent stuff looks good up to about 8x. I am talking about really close up.</p>

<p>Beyond 8x and technique, lenses, etc, etc become much more critical. For instance I was shooting some fashion stuff a long time ago with my lighting kit that is perfectly fine and plenty powerful. The problem was I was shooting on medium format for something that involved a lot of action and the target display size was going to be about 20x. Guess what - my flashes had a duration of 1/750 second - pretty fast but at 20x you could see motion ghosting in the models hair. Not good for what the job was. I had to spend a ton of money on some profoto packs and heads just to get a flash duration of 1/2000s to make the ghosting go away. The images would have been perfectly fine at 10x. If I could have I would have shot it on 4x5 but there was no way to do that and get the job done in any reasonable amount of time - if ever. I definitely needed to shoot more than a frame or two to nail the shot.</p>

<p>Fast forward to my posts and medium format film - when I scan medium format film that has a short side of 9000 pixels and show you an unsharpened &#8220;100%&#8221; view you are seeing a piece of something that is 90 inches wide from a foot away or&#8230; 40x magnification. Ta&#8230;.Da&#8230;. Something that most of you have never seen - a 40x magnification of something under a microscope that was hand held shot in available light at 1/125 second at f4 and quickly manually focused on 400 speed black and white film. In the real world of stuff we might make with that negative like a big book it will not only look fantastic but quite possibly look better than anything shot on a smaller format no matter what the pixel count because of the fact for the real world stuff the magnification will be lower due to the larger capture device.</p>

<p>I hope I did not confuse the matter even more. Bottom line - when making pictures image magnification counts a lot - the lower the better - not just pixel count. In fact unless you are actually running into issues where you need to make images bigger and do not have enough pixels to do so than they don&#8217;t do much. As for cropping - sure go ahead but not too much - no matter how many pixels you have to crop out of, you are increasing image magnification. If you think you are going to crop out a head from a crowd and it will be a fantastically beautiful headshot because you have more pixels you are dreaming. You really do need to get the image size &#8220;about&#8221; right on the film/sensor/etc. if you do not want it to fall apart. Hence - If you want to occasionally make really big images that look great you may find it easier and cheaper to grab some of the fantastic medium format film gear that is out there.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. EVERYTHING at 40x microscope magnification looks like crap, all movement and vibration starts to show up, unless you focused at 40x magnification your focus looks like crap, EVERYTHING looks like it sucks. When will you make output that is 20x magnification designed for close viewing? NEVER - if you have to you are using the wrong device to capture your images, get something bigger and go for lower magnification for the same target output size.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2009_003_05.jpg"><img title="2009_003_05.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2009_003_05.jpg" border="0" alt="2009_003_05.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="left" /></a>A quick update on my commitment to shoot film with my M6 prior to springing for an M9. Well, I finally got the kinks worked out of my development process and tools, so I am ready to go. Remember the first two rolls I sent through? Almost decade old TMZ and TRI-X? I found the answer of what was going wrong - it wasn&#8217;t me. The tank I was using had developed a crack that was invisible for the most part but not invisible to the film. I did the latest roll with a larger different tank and no more giant fog and &#8220;opened the camera back&#8221; look.</p>

<p>I did order a replacement small batch tank and a bunch of fresh film. I ordered some fresh stuff in both medium format and 35mm. I figured if I am going to fire up the wet process there was no reason to just shoot with the M series. I will give my medium format film stuff some exercise as well. This is actually fun. The images included with the post are two frames from the beginning of that last roll that didn&#8217;t have any obvious faults. Again 7 or 8 year old TRI-X that I had never processed. There are actually a bunch of frames that have some potential. I wonder why I chucked this roll to the side way back when? Most likely I got busy with commercial stuff and didn&#8217;t have a slot for the the film type/developer for it and forgot about it.</p>

<p>For anybody that is remotely curious the developer that I have been using is Pyrocat HD in<a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/2009_003_03.jpg"><img title="2009_003_03.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/.thumbs/.2009_003_03.jpg" border="0" alt="2009_003_03.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="right" /></a> glycol. I have a bit of experience with it in the past and now that it comes premixed in glycol it should keep extremely well - the glycol doesn&#8217;t do anything but preserve the stock solutions better than water but that is important if I am not going to be doing high volume work. The liquid kit cost about $30 and makes 50 liters of working solution. For my uses that is about 100 rolls of film. I could probably double that if I change my process a bit but 500 ml is about the practical limit for a single roll of film in my setup. So I guess the price is about 30Â¢ a roll - not too extravagant.</p>

<p>The fresh films that I ordered are Kodak TRI-X 400 (TX), TRI-X 320 (TXP), TMAX 100 (TMX), TMAX 400 (TMY), and Efke R100. For the uninitiated, the TX and TXP are completely different films - both wonderful - but Kodak should have probably named them something completely different. The only thing they have in common is spectral response. The TMX is one of my go to films, the TMY is the new version that I have never tried so I am going to calibrate it and see what I think - just in case TRI-X goes away or maybe I will be surprised and find that I love it for some reason. The R100 is to see if this is actually the same really old style stuff that gives me results like Veripan - I tried some of it a long time ago and it had a really nice scale so we will see.</p>
