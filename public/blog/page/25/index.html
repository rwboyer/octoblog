  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/DSC_0282v3.jpg"><img title="DSC_0282v3.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/.thumbs/.DSC_0282v3.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_0282v3.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="100" align="left" /></a>Warning - this is a philosophical post, not a technical post. It is not about right or wrong, not a value judgement, and certainly not a rant. Most of my rants are meant to be semi-sarcastic - I am old enough to know that that type of presentation is not widely received in a positive manner. This is my first and possibly only seriously post regarding the rarified subject of art and photography at the same time. I have spent a long time thinking about this subject and wrestling with it as so many others have in the past. You may know my taste at this point in time gravitates heavily toward photojournalistic images that bring every element that I consider to be the essential elements of still photographs together in a way that transcends the merely documentary with out any pretense, artifice, in their most pure and un-adulterated form. Obviously my thought process is flavored and biased by this - I will not argue that it is not. Now that the warning label is over let&#8217;s get to the thoughts - spurred via an email conversation I had with a photographer that ran across some of my film/prints/art lesson posts.</p>

<p>Answer the following question for yourself - why do you take pictures? Really - why? Family or personal memories, recording historical evidence of things near and dear to you? Yes okay - probably pretty important maybe the most important reason to make photographs. Fantastic - what if what is near and dear to you is of interest to other people - even better because you now have an audience - if it is a big audience this might allow you to just do that thing and all will be well in the world. Can we agree on the above - the &#8220;near and dear part&#8221;? Let&#8217;s call that class 1 images no matter how &#8220;good&#8221; they are and no matter what size your audience for those are. Â It really does not matter what the subject matter is - if the audience size is one or the world - those images are important.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s move down the list to images of things that interest you in some way. Doesn&#8217;t matter what the subject matter is - just that it interests you. The subject - not the end result of you making an image of the subject but the subject of the image in and of itself. In other words you would pay attention to what is in front of you and spend time doing so even if you had no agenda to make an image of some sort. The difference is that these subjects are not in the &#8220;near and dear&#8221; category. Of course they may also be interesting and relevant to other people as well. Let&#8217;s call these class 2 images.</p>

<p>Down another notch is making images of subjects where you are way way more interested in the result you will achieve by making the image rather than the subject of the image itself. Now I was very specific in this description - I did not say NO interest in the subject - I said less interested in the subject than the result of you making the image. Let&#8217;s say that can range from zero interest to right up to the point where it hits the same interest as the end result. Let&#8217;s call these class 3 images.</p>

<p>Yes I know that was long and wordy - sorry about that. I do need to add one more condition to the above classifications. All of those classifications can have similar audiences and be equally as profitable - keyword is &#8220;can&#8221; but&#8230; The differentiator which is entirely a personal thing is that you absolutely would probably not be spending your time on class #3 type images if there was no reward in the end result - usually money but sometimes other currencies. Class #1 on the other hand is something you would be spending time on no matter what - images no images, reward or not. Finally Class #2 is hmmm, a maybe category maybe you would maybe you wouldn&#8217;t be spending time on the subject if there were no image making involved - maybe you would - maybe there is some external reward for making the images you make maybe there isn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>If we can agree above on the three arbitrary but general categories I have described then let&#8217;s move on to assign &#8220;commercial&#8221; endeavors - this is where you make money from your images. This has nothing to do with classification 1, 2 or 3. It has to do with a personal evaluation because all of three have commercial potential - I did not nor would I assign a specific subject to a classification - it is all about your personal relationship to the images you shoot. Here is a secret - the vast majority of professionals make their living on class #3 images. I am not saying that they would rather be a ditch digger 0r a bank executive - maybe they would maybe they wouldn&#8217;t but I can say that most of them make a living shooting class #3 subjects as related to themselves. Here is why - the market defines what you shoot and how you shoot it. The end.</p>

<p>There are a handful of photographers that make a living shooting class #2 images - they are very very lucky. If you make your living doing anything that could be class #2 subject matter you have it made in the shade and if you don&#8217;t you are in the same boat as 90%+ too bad. There are very very very few people that make a living making class #1 image or doing class #1 anything - images are even tougher than other endeavors for a multitude of reasons.</p>

<p>If you do photography for the joy of it I would suggest you really really think through why the heck you would waste your time on anything remotely close to class #3 subject matter - further more I would suggest that you really examine how you treat (in terms of production, post Â production, and presentation) the class #1 and class #2 images you decide to make and why you do what you do with them. They can serve a number of purposes - illustration of a story, instructional, evidentiary, documentary, or &#8220;art&#8221;. Of course they can serve more than one purpose.</p>

<p>OOoops there is that word I warned you about - &#8220;ART&#8221;. Means a lot of different things to a lot of different people - to some it is an &#8220;investment&#8221; and the investment part is what imbues the &#8220;value&#8221;. To others it&#8217;s exclusivity and the rarity is what makes it &#8220;valuable&#8221; to them - for others it is decorative in the sense that there is some aesthetic reason for it&#8217;s existence as an object that may not be wholly dependent on it&#8217;s own individual beauty or meaning but more part of the decor. Then there are thought precesses of art as beauty or meaning that is intertwined in some strange way.</p>

<p>If we take that last thought there are two schools of thought on &#8220;art&#8221; one that says the beauty and meaning is in the who and how,when, and the context of the object&#8217;s making - not the object itself. The other is that the &#8220;art&#8221; is the object itself - as in what it looks like, what it is made out of, etc. No matter which school you subscribe to or a little bit of both you have to admit that a &#8220;reproduction&#8221; of such an object - no matter where it obtains it&#8217;s value or how you define it&#8217;s &#8220;artfulness&#8221; - the reproduction is somehow lesser than the real object. In fact I would go so far as to say that the espousers of the second school are a little wrong-headed, not my judgement, just my observation in none of those that subscribe to this put &#8220;value&#8221; on a reproduction - even a &#8220;perfect&#8221; reproduction. How can that be - you mean that even the object speaks for itself and has nothing to do with the artist people do not value perfect reproductions the same? Hmmm. There is a flaw in that thought process somehow, isn&#8217;t there?</p>

<p>All of those words - just to bring the conversation to this point. I would go so far as to say that the only context a reproduction of &#8220;art&#8221; has is as a representation of the original if it has meaning and beauty as art in the first school of thought - who, how, when, effort, context, tools, medium, etc - not as a perfect or imperfect reproduction of the object itself. That brings us to the philosophical question of digital simulations of things that are not inherent in the digital image capture medium itself and where they belong in your personal photographic endeavors.</p>

<p>For class #3 images anything goes and anything is valid - for the most part they are ephemeral in nature they exist for one purpose only - to do a job and they they are disposable for both producers and consumers of those images when that purpose is done. The market dictates where things like digital grain simulations, and brushstrokes, etc, etc are &#8220;appropriate&#8221;.</p>

<p>For class #1 and class #2 images that we make I really really question the utility, the purpose, and the motivation of the producer in the simulation of anything that is not inherent in the chosen capture and presentation medium. Digitally simulated grain? For what purpose? I am serious. If I want to go further maybe digital &#8220;Black and White&#8221; maybe not but it would be an interesting topic to discuss. Is it for purely decorative or &#8220;artistic&#8221; value? If it is then why not just use the medium that has those inherent properties? We are talking about class #1 and class #2 images here - not class #3. Is the motivation that they are personal art works? The subject is of interest to you and on top of that you feel the need to simulate some other properties it might have had if you have used another medium? Why? Are you trying to fool yourself or other people into beliving there is some sort of history or context or effort in the making of the &#8220;art&#8221; that there is not? Why does that make it better to you? Â I am not making fun of anyone that does these things. It is a question I continue to wrestle with myself - for now I do not produce any end product that I consider class #1 or class #2 images to anyone anywhere for pleasure or profit that contain any simulations not inherent in the capture or delivery medium until I get to the bottom of this question for myself. I would love to hear others thought process on this - with the exception of class #3 images - market directed.</p>

<p>That brings me to digital &#8220;fine-art&#8221; photographers and why I make fun of this endeavor. I mock because I do not understand it&#8217;s motivation, it&#8217;s goal, most of it&#8217;s subject matter, and the objects that are produced under this umbrella - with almost no exception the images produced simulate the characteristics of other mediums and therefor make absolutely no sense in ether school of thought on &#8220;art&#8221;, they use a self imposed label of &#8220;fine-ART&#8221; but seem to possess no characteristics that make art worth much - either school of thought, and that seems to me to fall into class #3 images because the primary motivation of production seems to be to sell prints. Â I am still waiting for someone to explain how they don&#8217;t. But&#8230; But&#8230; The object - C&#8217;est magnifique - well only in the sense that a CNC, laser produced machine part will blow the crap out of the finest 15th century craftsmanship but it is not the same thing as a renaissance sculpture in terms of an object d&#8217;art. Sort of defeats the whole purpose does it not? Pointless?</p>

<p>I will wrap this never ending 2000 word post up with a question, I have asked a few so far and really would love to hear your answers. This one is more of a multiple choice on so it&#8217;s easy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I will bet you can guess that this is yet another rant. Can any of you reading this post please, please, please, oh please answer some simple question? It is a two part question.</p>

<p>Part One - Why the hell do photographers in this day and age of mid-2010 continue to do what seems to me like the stupidest thing in the world - strip the color profile out of images that they post on the web on their own freaking web site?</p>

<p>Part Two - WTF?</p>

<p>On to the rant - way way way back in 2003 or 2004 I was in a workshop that had nothing to do with digital photography and as usual digital, computer, and internet crap came up. When this happens and I happen to be participating in a workshop on things NOT DIGITAL my freaking eyes literally roll back in my head. I can&#8217;t stop it. Why? because I know what is coming next - usually ridiculous nonsense passed on from the presenter that doesn&#8217;t know much about how anything actually works. Then it gets confused, convoluted, and voodooized beyond imagination into something that is completely different than what it started as. After this goes through 10 generations it becomes so ridiculous and treated like some sort of stone tablets brought down from the mountain by a prophet and stuck in an awe inspiring box with the power of god - then worshipped by countless generations till kingdom come (forgive the religious references - hyperbole).</p>

<p>So way way back - as part of the digital aside the speaker repeats the advice to make sure the image is sRGB AND THEN strip all of the color profile information to make sure it shows up CORRECTLY on the web. WTF? I knew this was idiotic back in the early part of this century. Yea I know a lot of browser users still have browsers that do not respect color profile data, and not many people have calibrated viewing environments - so the f#$% what - why why why why why do professional photographers (and non-pro&#8217;s) - people that should know better - continue to this day to do this ridiculous counter productive exercise so that NO ONE ANYWHERE CAN POSSIBLY SEE THEIR IMAGES AS INTENDED?</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. Seriously I do want to hear from people that do this as to why they think it is a good idea - I promise I will not make fun of you. Promise!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/DSC_9596Ap3_DaylightD200std.jpg"><img title="DSC_9596Ap3_DaylightD200std.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/.thumbs/.DSC_9596Ap3_DaylightD200std.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_9596Ap3_DaylightD200std.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="101" align="left" /></a>Disclaimer - I still think Adobe ACR and camera profiles are a decent way of going about the RAW conversion business and that Apple has it&#8217;s collective head up it&#8217;s you know what when it comes to NEF processing but&#8230;</p>

<p>Being the ever color vigilant - I noticed something about the updates for the latest greatest ACR (supported versions) on some (not all Nikon NEF files). I am going to show you a camera that is near and dear to my heart and one that now seems to be broken - from my earlier testing and memory - it used to work in ACR 4.5, and 5 - The D200.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at three quick and dirty conversions, first up is the gold standard NX2 rendering daylight WB (not as shot) and Picture Control Standard.</p>

<p><img title="DSC_9596NX2_daylight_std.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/DSC_9596NX2_daylight_std.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_9596NX2_daylight_std.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="500" height="335" /></p>

<p>Next up is ACR 5 using the same profiles, and daylight WB applied -updated with the latest updates - ooops what happened?</p>

<p><img title="DSC_9596ACR6_daylight_std.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/DSC_9596ACR6_daylight_std.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_9596ACR6_daylight_std.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="500" height="335" /></p>

<p>Finally Aperture 3 with my patented D200 NEF presets and my ultra secret sauce daylight WB preset.</p>

<p><img title="DSC_9596Ap3_DaylightD200std.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/DSC_9596Ap3_DaylightD200std.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_9596Ap3_DaylightD200std.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="500" height="335" /></p>

<p>Hmmm - looks like my way is now the winner. Maybe I should work on the presets some more like with curves vs the brightness/contrast sliders and start charging like ten bucks ;-)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/1999_009_09_flatten_4x6.jpg"><img title="1999_009_09_flatten_4x6.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/.thumbs/.1999_009_09_flatten_4x6.jpg" border="0" alt="1999_009_09_flatten_4x6.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="left" /></a>I have written about Nik&#8217;s wonderful Silver EFX Pro on numerous occasions, including one of my very rare non-review reviews. In a word it is the only black and white simulation software I would bother with. It is really really good in a lot of ways. In my review I did complain about the film simulations not being quite right - sort of like over the top cartoon versions of the represented films - of course you can fine tune them to your liking. My main point was that if you are going to simulate a bunch of different classic B+W films why not do it &#8220;right&#8221; - I guess that is in the eye of the beholder.</p>

<p>My other complaint was that I really didn&#8217;t like the way the grain simulation engine worked - from a perspective of the defaults that are built into each film simulation and far more importantly I really would like a better way to tell the software - or for the software to determine how much grain their should be. To summarize - there is no real &#8220;scale&#8221; to the grain. You absolutely need to treat the grain simulation entirely on two factors - one how many pixels your image actually has - and how big a print you are making. The other thing I didn&#8217;t really declare as perfect was that the simulation didn&#8217;t really work the way real grain does - I will say it is by far the closest thing out there.</p>

<p>That summarizes what I have written about Silver EFX Pro&#8217;s grain simulation and film simulations - so why do I bring this up? Well&#8230; A reader that consumed all of that as well as my rants on how wonderful film is and why you need to treat it intelligently when you digitize it and scale it in a very very nice way told me that it would be freaking nice if I said something productive instead of just complaining. Okay - so I will show you and then let you know how I deal with some issues of grain simulation - I will take Silver EFX Pro first, rather than film since I am sure that is the more productive conversation.</p>

<p>Here is a 100% view of real Kodak TRI-X processed in D-76 by me:</p>

<p><img title="1999_009_09_crop.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/1999_009_09_crop.jpg" border="0" alt="1999_009_09_crop.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="438" height="438" />\</p>

<p>Here is an image captured on a DSLR 100% processed with Silver EFX Pro&#8217;s TRI-X simulation:</p>

<p><img title="06022008000089SFX_TX_crop.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/06022008000089SFX_TX_crop.jpg" border="0" alt="06022008000089SFX_TX_crop.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="466" height="466" /></p>

<p>Now - when I say 100% that can mean a lot of things - in this case it means that I upres&#8217;ed the digital image to the same pixel dimensions as the film scan and then ran the Silver EFX Pro simulation - why did I do this? Because if I didn&#8217;t it would not be a fair comparison. The relative grain to deal would be lower. In other words the grain would be proportionally BIGGER to the image detail because the Silver EFX Pro&#8217;s complete dependency on the original image pixel dimensions (remember this is something that I criticized). You might say - no RB you are wrong - because that is not what the grain engine says it is doing&#8230; I say to you - No you are wrong think about the grain per pixel thing for a couple of more minutes and then get back to me. Better yet let me show you.</p>

<p>Here is the TRI-X simulation run on a full size (same size as 35mm film scanned at 4000 DPI or about 25 megapixels) and then resized to approximately 4x6 on your monitor.</p>

<p><img title="06022008000089SFX_TX_flatten_4x6.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/06022008000089SFX_TX_flatten_4x6.jpg" border="0" alt="06022008000089SFX_TX_flatten_4x6.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="600" height="402" /></p>

<p>Here is the image resized to 4x6 on your monitor and THEN the TRI-X simulation is run on that smaller image:</p>

<p><img title="06022008000089SFX_TX_smart_4x6.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/06022008000089SFX_TX_smart_4x6.jpg" border="0" alt="06022008000089SFX_TX_smart_4x6.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="600" height="402" /></p>

<p>Whoa&#8230; Wot? Okay it is exaggerated a little bit because the image I sent in was really small but it exaggerates the problem that I have been talking about. The image size you start with TOTALLY dictates what the grain simulation effects are.</p>

<p>Assuming you are following this so far let&#8217;s evaluate the real TRI-X scan vs the simulation. Depending on how picky you are you can evaluate it one of two ways as visually presented. For arguments sake let&#8217;s say you are not super picky and we&#8217;ll say - &#8220;hey it&#8217;s not too bad - in fact it is pretty close&#8221;. Okay it is pretty good but that is ONLY because the digital capture is now the equivalent of 25 megapixels - if you are shooting at say a more reasonable 12-15 it is going to be far far exaggerated as compared to the detail size in the image. Hold that thought for a second and also consider that to a large degree that digital resizing works the opposite of optical resizing. There are some things that work the same but when it comes to grain downsizing the image for display actually exaggerates the grain. It does this in areas of the image where the grain has relatively high contrast because it keeps those high contrast pixels and throws out the low contrast pixels that are the same - this is because to render things you CANNOT get smaller then a pixel, even though the grain is only a pixel or two across at 40x magnification it stays the same size even as the image gets resized smaller.</p>

<p>So what does this translate into in the real world of displaying images? It boils down to this - There is no one size fits all setting that works on ANY ONE image let alone across all images of differing input sizes. There are dependencies that need to be taken into account and different simulation settings. They are:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Input image pixel dimensions.</li>
    <li>Output image apparent magnification (you can use the word size but it is really size vs. what size you want to seem like you started with 35mm, MF, LF?)</li>
    <li>Output resolution/ppi/dpi</li>
</ol>


<p>The bottom line is that you will need different settings for print vs screen at any given real image dimensions and those settings will vary tremendously based on the pixel dimensions of the original image you started with (4 mpix, 6mpix, 12mpix, 24mpix?)</p>

<p>If you were expecting a one shot recipe that you could stamp all over your images - sorry but that is impossible for me to deliver given the workings of the software at this point. I can give you some general guidance - compared to real life film. If you are working with 25 megapixel starting images the settings are almost right assuming you are comparing 35mm film. I would say they may be a little overboard Â but it depends on real world processing factors that can only be speculated on. You be the judge based on the two images I showed you. They are way way too much for medium format and larger at similar pixel densities. So&#8230; If you are starting with less pixels and/or you are trying to simulate larger formats of film - you need LESS and smaller grain in the simulation.</p>

<p>I say all of that in the context of making prints where your real output resolution is at or above 300ppi. Images to be displayed at web sizes on the screen require far less grain for the given film sizes - the issue is that what settings are appropriate are highly image and resize method dependent.</p>

<p>Someday I wish Nik would provide parameters that are conceptually similar to what they have done with Sharpen Pro vs what they have with Silver EFX Pro at the moment. Maybe something like film format, output magnification, and output medium or ppi. The the software could render the appropriate grain simulation taking into account what you were after. You could spec something like 35mm, 8x (8x10), print (vs monitor). Nik would take over and render the appropriate grain simulation based on film type and give you an image that looked appropriate no matter what you input image size was.</p>

<p>Hope this was at all helpful to any fellow Silver EFX Pro fans/users.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps - yet another reason I run Nik filters in PS on smart objects.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I do not write a lot about Photoshop - honestly I do not use it for anything remotely sophisticated now. I make stupid logos, use it for a plug-in/filter consolidation platform as I described, a couple of printing tools that I find essential - like genuine fractals, but for the most part no big deal retouching.</p>

<p>A few people have emailed me about my last post to 1) thank me for pointing out the obvious - they were using BOTH Aperture plug-ins AND Photoshop - duhhhh and 2) Ask me my thoughts on CS5. Especially since I advised waiting - at least in the context of using it as a filter consolidation platform - as I do for the most part - namely with Nik Software. It is pretty useless if your filters/plug-ins are still 32bit. They wanted to know what I thought overall.</p>

<p>Here is the short version - I think it will be a worthwhile upgrade when all the pieces come together. I think the content aware fill is awesome - sort of wipes out a lot of what we all learned to do the hard way or the &#8220;right way&#8221;. Amazing stuff for panos and such. What I cannot stand is the stability of it - or lack there of. If you complained about Aperture 3 - brace yourself. Both people that wrote me experienced the same issues as I did. Specifically it only runs for about 5 minutes, if that, before unpredictably consuming all available memory.</p>

<p>All of us running OS X 10.6.3 and 10.6.4 - doesn&#8217;t matter. Here is how it goes - open up CS5 on a small 100Meg-ish image file, everything is fine memory stabilizes with CS5 using about 200-300 Megs, add a curves layer, maybe another one - everything fine still about the same. Select a new tool over in the toolbar or bring up a dialog - lots of seemingly random dialogs like say the new HDR toning, or color picker, or the lasso tool, with no seeming rhyme or reason - bam - CS5 is now gobbling down 3G of REAL ram with a giant virtual foot print for no apparent reason.</p>

<p>So three people that I talked to in the last hour have seen this - why is it not all over the web? Is it and my google is not working or something?</p>

<p>Anyone else know what is going on with CS5? For the most part I am sticking to CS4 for now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/DSC_7945.jpg"><img title="DSC_7945.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/.thumbs/.DSC_7945.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_7945.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="99" align="left" /></a>As most of you already know but some may not, I am an avid Nikon shooter, black and white photographer, ex-commercial/fashion photographer, and film shooter. So what does this have to do with Aperture 3 and digital photography? Believe it or not a whole lot but you need to know how I arrived where I am and also get some context about what I am about to recommend.</p>

<p>Being a Nikon digital shooter since the way way back time of a decade ago, I am very familiar with Nikon Capture - as ugly as it was, it has grown over the years and it&#8217;s current incarnation is NX2. Capture NX2 is not a supreme work-flow tool but it did give me an introduction to Nik Software&#8217;s control points because they are built in. After using them you become extremely spoiled and do not ever want to use a brush again for masking - nor anything else. At least not for the most part. Having been active in fashion and commercial photography I am no slouch when it comes to Photoshop either. Enter Nik Viveza and then Nik Silver EFX Pro, and then Nik DFine, and then Nik Sharpener. You get the idea. I love them all but&#8230;</p>

<p>I do not use the Aperture plug-ins. I use the Photoshop plug-ins. I do this not only because I own Photoshop but also because it is a far far better work-flow than using the Aperture plug-ins. If you have ANY need for Photoshop or even if you don&#8217;t but use more than one image filter in any frequent way on the same image what I am about to say might be for you.</p>

<p>My work-flow for just about any image that requires localized corrections and ANY image tilter like Viveza or Silver EFX Pro, or anything else is ALWAYS - &#8220;edit with&#8230;&#8221; CS4 from Aperture. The reason I do this is two primary factors - space efficiency and work-flow efficiency. All of my local adjustments and filters are packaged into just one 16-bit PSD that is only a little bit bigger than EACH AND EVERY file you create if you use more than one Aperture plug-in. The second and bigger reason is that I immediately create a smart object in Photoshop CS4 that does a couple things - it is a bit of a space saver for filters vs. multiple bitmapped layers and better yet every single thing I do is saved and can be tweaked without having to re-invent the wheel to go back in my work-flow.</p>

<p>Now that Aperture 3 is 64bit and Nik plug-ins are still 32bit I am even more glad that I choose to do this vs struggling with switching modes and all the issues of running 32bit plug-ins in Aperture 3. That brings me to my next point about the state of affairs with Nik plug-ins, Aperture 3, Photoshop CS5, and any other 32bit plug-ins you might already have. If you are wondering what do to about upgrades, etc. JUST STOP for a second and consider the following.</p>

<p>CS5 is 64bit but a whole lot of plug-ins, including NIk&#8217;s are 32bit. They can work but not well - they actually have MORE memory space under CS4. If you are going to upgrade seriously consider waiting for your plug-ins to be 64bit before doing so. If you own Nik&#8217;s 32bit plug-ins for Aperture seriously consider buying the 64bit versions of PHOTOSHOP plug-ins rather than upgrading your Aperture plug-ins. If I am right Nik is going to charge a bundle for the 64-bit upgrade for existing customers - they always do. Do yourself another favor - nag the crap out of them to allow you to &#8220;upgrade&#8221; your Aperture plugins to Photoshop plug-ins for some fee. This is not an available option last time I checked but I do know of some few that were successful in convincing Nik to allow this - don&#8217;t know the details.</p>

<p>My own plan is to upgrade my CS4 to CS5 when the Nik plug-ins are 64bit unless I have a really really good reason to do it sooner. I would have about 3 years ago or 10 years ago when my giant film scans were active work but now I scan only a little bit of film - I can wait.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/2000_064_07.jpg"><img title="2000_064_07.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/.thumbs/.2000_064_07.jpg" border="0" alt="2000_064_07.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="100" height="150" align="left" /></a>I had an interesting conversation with a reader of this site that wanted to know about some of my photographic biases. Her words - not mine, note that she has never commented on any of the posts in question that display those biases and I doubt she will comment on this one so I hope I represent things fairly and accurately. My intent is to clarify some undertones that have obviously crept in over the years.</p>

<p>The main points of her inquiries can be summarized as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li> Why do I hate digital - considering I use it and write about it and obviously know the digital world so well.</li>
    <li>Why do I hate speedlights, built-in flash, and for that matter just about any little portable flash units.</li>
    <li>Why do I hate HDR</li>
    <li>Why do I hate new cameras and innovations.</li>
</ul>


<p>I will take these point by point but first I want to say that I don&#8217;t hate any of them - not one. I can see how one would think that I do based on quite a few flippant remarks and asides woven throughout the site - especially if you do not know me and we have never spoken. In general I would have to say I take the devil&#8217;s advocate&#8217;s position on what I would lump into the category of silver bullets, the emperor&#8217;s new clothes, over-hyped technical solutions to problems that don&#8217;t exist, over complication, and last but not least - snake oil salesmen that prey on the faithful in need of a cure.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s cover digital first. This obviously is in the context of film vs. digital. I don&#8217;t hate digital, I am not an either or person. I just love film in certain contexts and applications. A lot of film has an inherent beauty that digital just does not reproduce - it has a different &#8220;look&#8221;. I bring this up a lot because I feel it is important if you have a love of photography that you find some way to experience using film. I do this because the vast majority of people that I run into in 2010 that are photography enthusiasts have never really experienced film in a meaningful way, if at all.</p>

<p>I love the fact that more people are actually &#8220;into&#8217; making good photographs because of digital - the downside is that they really don&#8217;t have an appreciation of film and some of it&#8217;s wonderfulness. That wonderfulness extending to some things that are considered weaknesses. Yep - limited exposures, time to process, one ISO, less options for the treatment of color, actually choosing and knowing that you are shooting either color or black and white at capture time, grain, all of that stuff can be strengths and either teach or bring back an appreciation of subtlety. That last one - tiny, minuscule differences are one of the essential things that make or break a photograph - hopelessly lost in the age of digital where wild swings in color, saturation, sharpness, contrast, etc. are the norm. I don&#8217;t think most people can even evaluate subtle differences any more. In my book this is a bad thing.</p>

<p>Moving right along to portable/small/built-in flash. I don&#8217;t hate them either. I hate that built-in, autoflash, in the worst possible position has become the default. I think the default ruins most pictures people take. I think that the default makes people extremely lazy where they don&#8217;t even think about the actual light in the scene anymore.</p>

<p>Here is where it get&#8217;s really complicated. I also believe that most great images out there taken by ANYONE are not lit in anyway but ambient conditions. Â After making hundreds of thousands of photographs both professionally and personally combined with my own viewing experience from masters to my mom - I think the best photographs employ only ambient light. This doesn&#8217;t mean that there is not a place for &#8220;lit&#8221; photographs - of course there is. I made a living from this for 7 years. In fact some photographic endeavors are best served via strobe either aesthetically or practically or both. The other reason I pooh-pooh the current little light craze is because I think there are way too many people that know better purveying a bunch of nonsense for profit reasons - in other words telling people to do exactly the wrong thing to achieve a set of results - TTL automation, off-camera lights, expensive battery powered small units to achieve results that are easier, less expensive and better via manual large strobes.</p>

<p>HDR - now here is a topic that is sure to win me a curmudgeon of the year award. This one ranks right up there with things I consider wayward fashion trends that took too long to go away. I could be wrong here but I think HDR will go the way of the dodo bird real soon. Don&#8217;t take this the wrong way - I mean HDR as it sits now - with that nasty Photomatix software and such things. When someone says HDR what they really mean is Photomatix or something just like it.</p>

<p>The act of translating the very very contrasty world onto a piece of paper has been in existence since cavemen started drawing on cave walls. Painters do it - good painters to it very very well. Black and white photographers have ALWAYS done it - black and white film captures an amazing amount if information. Slide film shooters and digital guys do it and always have with graduated filters and balanced fill light of sorts. Even digital guys do it with multiple exposures long before the advent of automatic blending nonsense like Photomatix. In fact I think some of the multi-exposure composites I have seen are fantastic - I linked to a guy that does this a long time ago - I think I titled it &#8220;HDR done right&#8221; or something.</p>

<p>By the way - the choices of what goes black what goes white, where there is detail, where there is not, where there is high midtone contrast and where there is low contrast is the art of making a photograph - both at time of capture and when it comes to making a print. The HDR that I hate - and I do hate it is the rubbish that I see run through Photomatix et, al. Yea I know, I know, we will all agree on the generality of &#8220;good&#8221; and &#8220;bad&#8221; HDR but I am going to go further - it is all rubbish. I have given it a chance, I have let it sit. Even the work of the &#8220;masters&#8221; of sliding those Photomatix sliders - guess what, a year later even the images that I thought I liked look ridiculous to me at this point. Without fail my desire is to see a &#8220;regular&#8221; version of the same scene done well. Polyester leisure suit of the early 21st century.</p>

<p>I will not bother to answer the last one because I in no way hate innovation. Hope that clears up my position on things a bit more than just a flippant remark pointing to idiotic things like the 9 speedlight ring flash.</p>

In fact I know I have too much &#8220;stuff&#8221; so even though there are a few lust items - mostly ridiculous things that I have wanted since my youth like that giant ParaFB. Take it seriously when I say that there is a lens I have come across that has my attencion. The image at the top was made by a friend of mine, you can tell because it is outside and not 10 feet away from my front door, oh and it doesn&#8217;t have people in it which means it is somewhere in the middle of nowhere - not my favorite type of hangout.</p>

<p>The image is strait out of his camera using a lens that is one of the finest pieces of glass I have ever seen. Even at the relatively high price it costs. The brand, brand, brand new Leica may be as good or even a hair &#8220;better&#8221; at three times the cost but lacks the same features. I am sure the two are comparable - this is probably one of the best 24mm lenses for 35mm/FX ever made. The Nikon 24mm tilt-shift. Absolutely phenomenal. Check it out if you need fantastic glass - it truly blows me away compared to my okay lenses in that range.</p>

<p>On to the next thing - Have I just got some sort of vendetta from past experience or do the people at Apple have some sort of conspiracy to drive us all mad with nagging metadata issues? Has anyone noticed the couple that seem to be true across all cameras in Aperture 3? Like the Lens Model EXIF NOT being exported - ever. Does someone have any idea why this is true? Has anyone ever seen any Aperture 3 install on any camera actually export Lens Model in any format? WTF?</p>

<p>Last for Friday morning - I am long over my crazed want and desire for the Leica M9 - the answer for me is NO. I am perfectly happy with shooting film in my Leica cameras for now. I do still really really really want a small high quality portable digital kit with a largish sensor for many many reasons - more aesthetic DOF reasons than techno-nonsense. I guess I will have to wait - maybe forever. Until then I am thinking seriously of a D5000 for cheap and two large aperture fixed lenses as my point and shoot. Anyone try this sort of small P/S kit yet?</p>

If you have a minute I would like to know your thoughts on a topic that is of great interest to a good friend of mine. He is a fantastic travel/nature photographer and journalist. His bread and butter are shooting assignments for traditional print media outlets (won&#8217;t name names right now - doesn&#8217;t matter). I have been nagging and nagging him to bring himself into the 21st century and have finally convinced him to give it a try.</p>

<p>He travels all over the planet to really out of the way places - of course he will still do what he does while doing that. Namely he will shoot a bunch of images at hours way too early for my taste and end up with a couple fantastic giant prints. I have convinced him to do something else as well. Here is what I would love to know from all of you web iTravellers - Would you be at all interested in a daily blog report of his endeavors with a couple less than perfect documentary photos? The trials and tribulations of getting to the middle of nowhere - travel arrangements - experiences with lodging, equipment, failures of equipment, plan vs reality, what to do with wife and children while traveling on photo business, physical challenges, people he meets, etc, etc. The good the bad and the ugly - in real time?</p>

<p>I have convinced him to give this kind of thing a whirl vs just ending up with a couple page story and 10 perfect images that see the light of day. What do you think? Any other things you would be really interested in? If you have a moment I would love to hear your specific thoughts in comments as well.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/DSC_1172___Version_2.jpg"><img title="DSC_1172___Version_2.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/.thumbs/.DSC_1172___Version_2.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_1172___Version_2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="100" align="left" /></a>I urge you to take a few moments, moments when you are not distracted by anything else, not tempted to click somewhere else, not distracted by your email and - watch these few short videos from photojournalists brought to use by the Sydney Morning Herald. You can learn a lot from listening to these people - more than you can by reading about lenses, the latest digital non-sense, or noise tests. Look at their photographs while they are speaking.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/interactive/2010/national/photos1440/index.html">Here are the mini-interviews</a> All of these people sum up the reasons I continue to say that photojournalism is the highest form of the art of photography - the one unique thing that still photography does that no other medium does. They also sum up the reasons I so detest what I used to do - commercial fashion. No matter what you shoot and why I guarantee you these people will help you and you will not regret spending the few minutes.</p>

<p>The first guy - Steve Christo is probably the photographer that I agree with everything he says and identify with the most, even though he shoots mostly sports - something i have no interest in. The second photographer - Brendon Esposito is spot on - even thought his opening contradictory comments are hopelessly false, the reason they are contradictory is a quintessential truth all thoughtful photographers wrestle with. All of them shoot amazingly powerful images and there are some themes that they ALL say - either implicitly or explicitly. Get close to your subjects if at all possible, both physically and psychologically (note focal lengths used for the best stuff). Really great images are really really hard to make and they have NOTHING to do with resolution, etc, etc, etc. Even being talented, dedicated, and doing it every single day for decades - they claim only a handful of really great images.</p>

<p>Please - watch and listen to this. A very rare moment when some people who know their stuff drop the pomp, and the bullshit, and provide invaluable photographic education.</p>
