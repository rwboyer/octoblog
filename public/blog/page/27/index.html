  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/DSC_0315___Version_2.jpg"><img title="DSC_0315___Version_2.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/.thumbs/.DSC_0315___Version_2.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_0315___Version_2.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="64" align="left" /></a>Forgive me for not updating the site in what seems like a decade. I would love to say that I have been hard at work on finishing up the Aperture 3 updates to my eBooks or producing a gaggle of Aperture 3 screencasts that are better and more reasonably priced than my more capitalistic colleagues but the fact is that I have been suffering from spring fever. Happens every year. I hope to be over it soon. On that note I have been at least jotting down all of the things that cross my mind to post regarding Aperture, photography, etc. What is it they say about &#8220;The faintest ink&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>I was going to write a really insightful but non-exciting soliloquy  about all of the wonderful new Adobe stuff like CS5 and LR3 but to tell you the truth I am not that excited about it. Don&#8217;t get me wrong I will eventually upgrade to CS5 just for the 64bit-ness. Instead I am going to write a little about inspiration. Again. Not for the purpose of inspiring you with my thoughts and experiences but more to help fellow photographers to find there own method. Yes - method. That might seem a little bit contrary to the whole notion of inspiration and it sort of is but  if you are going to be successful in your own artistic endeavors you are going to need a process.</p>

<p>Instead of trying to express some detailed complete and holistic recipe I&#8217;ll just share some snippets of things I do - religiously - and where they lead me. I&#8217;ll try to keep this short but with enough of my own thought process so that hopefully it will be a little more than the bottom line of &#8220;write your ideas and inspirations down&#8221; - always, without fail and do it immediately. Everyone knows this, right? Why do so few people do it? My guess is that they feel either stupid doing it, the particular emotion, feeling, etc has nothing to do with the particular thing they are working on or thinking about right now, or they don&#8217;t think it is useful. Trust me, even if 80% turns out to be useless. The 20% will be useful. If not now, it will be down the road, even if only to lead you somewhere else in your thinking. Write down anything, just a few words will do, reflect on it a little the next day, write down some more if something crosses your mind. It doesn&#8217;t have to stand on it&#8217;s own, it doesn&#8217;t have to be anything. It can be sterile and boring or poetic. Doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>

<p>The other night I was outside at about 10pm and got a surge of electricity, pangs of anxiety. Not the bad kind - the good kind. The rock star taking the stage kind with all the associated adrenaline fueled restlessness that comes with it. Why? The endless promise and possibilities of a new summer. So what did I write down? Embarrassingly enough - just a couple of words and phrases describing my surroundings - the things my physical senses told me about.</p>

<p>&#8220;Blue velvet sky with countless stars&#8221;, &#8220;soft silvery moonlight&#8221;, &#8220;fireflies&#8221;, &#8220;smell of honeysuckle&#8221;, &#8220;music&#8221;, &#8220;laughter of post adolescent teenage girls&#8221;, &#8220;warm glow of lights through open windows&#8221;. That&#8217;s it. The next day I read those things and thought a little bit about why those things exerted such power on me. Guess what all of a sudden a late teenage summer tradition hit me like a train. I wrote it all down, everything I could think of. To spare you the recitation of the semi-coherent short story that was the final result of my scribblings I&#8217;ll just summarize the event that I wrote down.</p>

<p>In the way back time in the area I grew up in, a well-to-do, very republican suburb most parents and younger siblings would disappear for large portions of the summer. Right down the road from me in a place called Rose Tree there were two sisters about my age that would have parties at least once a week. Dozens of girls from the all girls prep school that they attended and boys from all over the place. The road they lived on was wooded and infested with honeysuckle - so powerful you could hardly breath. They lived in a stone english manor style house typical for the neighborhood with a long stone drive lined with ancient elm trees and rose gardens. Walking down the drive towards the house you could hear the music coming from the patio on the back lawn and see a few of the people spilling out the sides. Over the music and chatter you could hear the song of young women&#8217;s laughter. The only light was that from the interior spilling out through the open windows and the moon on perfect - clear June nights. Hell I even wrote about how the giant weeping willow tree down by the stream at the back of the lawn looked and sounded.</p>

<p>I left out all of my feeble attempts to capture how that makes me feel, or things I remember saying to my friends walking up that drive with me on various occasions but I wrote them down anyway. Why? Am I working on some sort of summer image project? Nope but&#8230; I can personally pull about 100 image ideas directly from those memories and 1000 more ideas from my memories of how people looked, expressions, gestures, relationships, etc., etc. If not next week then a year from now. I have no idea where or what will become of the 15minutes I spent writing all of it down. The 30 seconds when it hit me or the balance when reflecting on it. Based on previous experience the absolute least it will do is paint me a picture on demand for anything related so that I can use it to inspire gesture or expression, the most it will do is give me a direct narrative for something I actually produce.</p>

<p>I hope that all of that was not a complete waste of time. I thought some of you t just starting to develop your own creative process will get some insight into a small part of mine. The bottom line that I mentioned at the beginning about writing everything down is on point, ideas, circumstances, memories, triggers, details - they all matter when producing a narrative of any type. Maybe more importantly is trying to grasp at the essence of things that evoke a strong reaction in you. You will forget the nuances if you don&#8217;t process them and the nuances and subtleties are what it is all about.</p>

<p>More later.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/144a9ky.jpg"><img title="144a9ky.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/.thumbs/.144a9ky.jpg" border="0" alt="144a9ky.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="50" align="left" /></a>Hope all of you have a fantastic weekend. I certainly plan on it. I am actually going to shoot some images this weekend. Maybe even of a guitar. Maybe even work it into a screencast work-flow lesson for Aperture 3 next week. I am feeling quite energetic. If you are not shooting enough (happens to me a lot) what gets you motivated to shoot?</p>

<p>For me most of the time it is something internal in my brain that goes click. Part of my bipolar nature I guess. Sometimes it is something external, some sort of outside motivation. I have been thinking for a while about what I could do to provide some outside influence or motivation to others out there to shoot more. A week or so ago I decided to shoot at least one decent image of a guitar. I personally have never taken a good one and most I see do not capture the essence of the object. It is harder than you might think. For whatever reason this got me motivated to shoot gaggles of images last week. No good ones but at least I am making progress on it and they started to evolve - environmental factors seem to be key in what I am trying to do with these images. Little tiny snippets of ambient surroundings that give a feel that I want. That and obviously the right composition and angles and light on the subject itself.</p>

<p>To connect the two ideas I was thinking&#8230; Do you have hobbies/interests that you don&#8217;t try to capture the essence of with your photography? Maybe because it is to &#8220;intellectual&#8221;, &#8220;cerebral&#8221;, &#8220;conceptual&#8221;, just plain difficult to do? If so how about a little mini online exposition of readers photographs of their hobbies/endeavors that ARE NOT the only subject matter they shoot - but more of the ones that they DON&#8217;T. Example - if you love camping and the outdoors - NO LANDSCAPES, how about your fishing rods instead if you like fishing. Something like that. I&#8217;ll host it and if we have a dozen or so people that want to participate it will be fun and educational in a lot of ways to each other but more importantly to yourself.</p>

<p>Any takers? Maybe we will make it some sort of contest with a prize based on votes or something?</p>

<p>On another note, I know that all of you are not musicians but a heck of a lot of you are here is a great example of why us whacked out guitarists routinely do not use traditional musical notation - it can be worse that useless in some cases. Personally I am not a good sight reader but I am educated and assure you this is quite accurate (well sort of - missing all the really important stuff like nuance and HOW that makes it what it is). A special prize goes to the first one to figure out what song is at the top of the post is the very first part of the intro to.</p>

<p>TGIF</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. For the not so musically inclined - you are not left out. Today is stupid subconscious pun day. There are three of them in this post. Special prize if you caught them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been quiet lately. Mostly because I have been idiotically busy with some other endeavors some of which are a wee bit more profitable than this web site. Not only that but I have also been playing my guitar (badly) since I started airing out my amps a week or so ago. Like usual I just about have my calluses back - almost. Now is about the time that I will get busy and distracted and all the crap will go back into storage for another year.</p>

<p>Enough of that - Did everyone install the latest Aperture 3 upgrade that recently came out? I did and it pretty much cures just about anything that was causing me grief. YMMV but Aperture 3 has come a long long way in a very short amount of time in my estimation. I am almost in digital photographic nirvana - almost. Now I may just have to upgrade to CS5 for my 64bit goodness from end to end. I know that I will - the big question for me is whether I wait until any of the plug-ins that I use are also upgraded or do it now. I use photoshop to package the couple of plug-ins from Nk that I use in a nice convienient one file wrapper with the added bonus that I can go back an tweak any of them after the first edit. I&#8217;ll write a bit on that later when I have a few moments.</p>

<p>One of the things that occurred to me this week related to Aperture 3 was that for the most part I do not use Aperture a whole lot differently than I ever did. I don&#8217;t know if this is an indicator of a really great design and feature set from the get go or just my human nature of doing things the same out of habit. The one exception to this is that ever since Aperture 3 hit my computer I have been spending more and more and more time in Aperture 3 full screen mode. Even on my big monitor. I think I will try to spend a little more time focused on using some of the Aperture 3 specific features a little more and see if I can improve my workflow just a wee bit more. If any of you folks are using Aperture 3 way differently than you were using Aperture 2 I am sure that we would all love to hear about it.</p>

<p>One other thing occurred to me while I was posting guitar silliness last week - I have never taken a decent image of any of my guitars - EVER. I haven&#8217;t really tried. I have Ebay quality images but nothing at all decent. More like evidence photos that the gear actually exists. I think I will give it a shot this week and try to do something with a little atmosphere that doesn&#8217;t take too much setup and production. Guitars are extremely challenging subjects to photograph and convey their beauty and presence in a two dimensional space. Sort of like photographing women competently - not easy.</p>

<p>Take a Fender Stratocaster for instance - this is one of the most beautiful pieces of sculpture ever created. If you have only seen pictures of one then you have no idea what one actually looks like. Well, maybe a vague idea but it in now way compares to the sumptuous beauty of the real thing in 3D. At least I have never seen a photo of a Stratocaster that gives me the same impression as the real thing. Maybe this will be a good summer non-project for me. It will teach me some things about making photographs and keep me playing.</p>

<p>Before you ask - the answer is NO, I have never ever photographed a woman and a guitar in the same image - I have no plans on ever doing so. Has anyone ever done this that doesn&#8217;t look like the cheesiest image ever?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/DSC_1064.jpg"><img title="DSC_1064.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/.thumbs/.DSC_1064.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_1064.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="100" align="left" /></a>I am amazed at how many musical/ex-musical/guitar people happen to be readers here. Even if just aficionados - is it Aperture? Does Aperture work the way music folk &#8220;get it&#8221; or what. Anyway I was truly surprised at the number of off-line internet conversations that my last post spawned all prefixed with &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to comment but&#8230;&#8221;. So I am sick of talking Aperture today - I have had way to many one on one&#8217;s this week. All of them very pleasant  and with some fantastic photographers and just great people but enough is enough for a week. Hence some controversial guitar stuff - and this stuff is more religious - chicken bone waving voodoo than any Canon/Nikon or Aperture/Lightroom talk will ever be. So here is a few things to chew on and either nod in agreement with or feel free to tell me how big an idiot I am as well.</p>

<p>Here are some random guitar thoughts that you may (or may not) find interesting based on my 30+ years of on and off playing. The good the bad and the ugly.</p>

<p>I love Fender Stratocasters -  I have owned  more than a dozen and up until a year ago when I started clearing out my gear warehouse of stuff that I never played (guitars, amps, effects, all of it) I had a stable of &#8220;to die for&#8221; &#8220;holy grail&#8221; strats. All of them but one were of the Fender Custom Shop variety, relics, NOS, pretty much a sample of premium built strats of all kinds. They were fantastic instruments - every one. Comparing them to the &#8220;real thing&#8221; which I also owned - meaning a couple of &#8220;pre-CBS&#8221; 60&#8217;s strats w and w/0 rosewood &#8220;necks&#8221; I can tell you beyond a shadow of a doubt that the Custom Shop versions were better instruments in many ways - they were absolutely perfect versions - prime examples of the vintage strat. Unless you are a collector forget &#8220;vintage&#8221; strats - they are a hit or miss thing in terms of wonderfulness from a players perspective. The Custom Shop &#8220;copies&#8221; are definitely the way to go. That being said guess what I kept as my ONLY strat. A late model American Standard that I put Kinman Woodstock pickups in. This is by far the best strat I have ever owned - best sounding - best playing - best best best. No shit. Not the prettiest - not the most &#8216;vintage vibey-ness&#8221; just the best and a fantastic example of how a great strat should play and sound. If you want a great playing/sounding strat go with an American Standard for a fraction of the price of a Custom Shop hand built jobby. I bought my daughter a Mexican traditional strat that is not bad either but the pick-ups were shit.</p>

<p>On to Les Pauls - I do not like them as much as strats - nope. But&#8230; everyone has to have one. When you are in the mood for an LP you just got have one. I had a bunch over my lifetime and up until the sell-off I had three prime examples - all of them absolutely gorgeous - figured tops, etc, etc. My favorite that I have ever owned and played - the ONE that I kept. This is going to knock your socks off - A 1999 Les Paul DC Studio in cherry sunburst - it is pretty but not like some of the &#8220;AAA&#8221; top guitars that cost a ton of money now. It is a very simple beast - wrap around &#8220;stop&#8221; tail piece - NO TUNE-O-MATIC. In fact NO individual intonation adjustments for each string - just a set screw on the left and right. Dot neck, rosewood finger board, the two stock pickups - a vintagey one and a slightly hot vintagey one. The standard tuners that you used to find on really old Les Pauls. Gold vs pearl lettering on the head stock. Dead simple - light weight (lighter than my strat) due to the &#8220;tone chambers in the mahogany part of the body. Maple top with a little tiny bit of figure which I am sure is an accident. I swear that this thing is the best playing best sounding LP I have ever had or even played - anywhere. It sounds like a les paul with maybe a tiny bit of SG in there - a little bit livelier than your garden variety. If you are hankering for a great LP at a bargain basement price - get the DC (double cut)  studio. They are NOT popular but I think are the most overlooked Gibson EVER. They stopped making them a few years ago.</p>

<p>On to amps - out of the fleet that I owned - actually more like an armada here is what is left with similar things that I got rid of because they did not sound as good:</p>

<p>1) Marshall JCM 2000 DSL 100 - the best Marshall head ever made. It is what I kept instead of a &#8220;real&#8221; JCM 800, a reproduction hand built Marshal 1967X Plexi, and a hand wired repoduction 1959SLP Plexi of the same ilk. The DSL100 can do them all - even better. I did keep two 4x12 cabs - an &#8220;A&#8221; with C75&#8217;s (you gotta love these if you came up in the 80&#8217;s) and a &#8220;B&#8221; with V30&#8217;s - completely different.</p>

<p>2) Mesa Heartbreaker - replaced a whole battle group of &#8220;vintage&#8221; crap.</p>

<p>3) Mesa LoneStar Special - One of the best amps ever - got rid of a Matchless DC-30 - yep the Mesa is better and can do so much more or sound exactly like the Matchless.</p>

<p>4) Victoria Victorilux - think of this as a prime example of a vintage fender with all the right parts and built with TLC so that it is perfect. Replaced a couple of &#8220;real&#8221; tweed fenders and a &#8220;black face&#8221; delux, and a reissue bassman (the hand built one) - If you want vintage fender nobody does it better than Mark at Victoria.</p>

<p>5) A real honest to goodness 1965 Fender Twin that looks like it has been through the war that I have had since I was about 17 - I kept it even though I was NOT into fender-y clean at that age. It has the worlds worst redo of the speaker grill that I did with the wrong material the wrong way when I replaced the blown speakers way way back as a teenager. An amp as old as me - sounds great - need I say more.</p>

<p>6)Line 6 PODxt and gearbox for recording into garage band and noodling around without bothering people 6 counties away.</p>

<p>As for effects - all digital delay type effects blow - no exceptions they sound like garbage. So I have a really old blue version of a boss analog chorus, a new BB preamp, an old Ibanez AD202 analog delay, and an old MXR white &#8220;micro amp&#8221; That is the effects = that is it.</p>

<p>On a note about amps - tube amps absolutely RULE. Amps are more important than guitars. They are part of the instrument - not just reproducing some sound that already exists. The amps I chose to keep represent the absolute best sounds across the major delineation of  every school of electric guitar. This is based on owning just about everything else at some point. The digital simulators sound like crap - with one exception and that is at LOW volume. I have never owned a tube amp that sounded good or even acceptable clean or dirty at &#8220;house/wife/girlfriend/kid/neighbor/eardrum&#8221; friendly levels. If you think any of the digital simulators sound okay at all it means that you are playing at &#8220;acceptable&#8221; volume levels and have probably never ever heard what a great amp sounds like in it&#8217;s zone of optimal operation. Every one of my amps doesn&#8217;t start to sound right in terms of harmonic reproduction, etc, etc, etc, until is opened up to about 40% or better. Maybe 30% on the Fender type stuff. Even my &#8220;little&#8221; amps with 1x12 are earth shatteringly loud at that output - my JCM with 2 4x12 cabs at 40% could be classified as a weapon - bone shattering, skin blistering, nuclear shockwave loud at 40-50% and that is just getting into the fantastic zone. So.. don&#8217;t by a tube amp that was made for a large club or a stadium and expect it to sound as good as your $200 digital amp simulator at any reasonable volume - heck even a single-ended 5 watt amp with a 10 or 12 inch speaker is really really loud by the time it sounds good.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/DSC_1056.jpg"><img title="DSC_1056.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/.thumbs/.DSC_1056.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_1056.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="100" align="left" /></a>As part of my annual ritual in the spring - sort of my version of spring cleaning once it is warm enough for me to open the windows I have the perennial airing out of the amps. That and I cannot even move my semi-arthritic old man fingers well until it warms up.</p>

<p>So yesterday I was firing up all of my beloved guitar amps so they could breath a little. God they sound so good. The Marshall, The 1965 Fender Twin, The Heartbreaker, the Victorilux, The Lonestar Special - all so very very sweet and very very different. Well the Lonestar had an issue - I am theorizing it&#8217;t the rectifier tube and I don&#8217;t happen to have a 5Y3 on hand - I could jamb a bigger one in, that&#8217;s supposedly safe but&#8230; If it is something else I do not want to deliver more current. Any whoooooo&#8230;.</p>

<p>I ran across this while searching for some info on diagnosing the Lonestar - I love this some of my best performances were me and another guy in a music store - so raw. Ahhhh.. back in the day when the local music store was sort of like a little improv gig. If you were ever a local musician you will know what I am talking about. Andy Timmons however takes it to a whole new level - check it. This is raw unbelievable live performance at it&#8217;s most basic. Inspiring. If you never heard of the guy he is pretty freaking good. I love the one comment on this clip - &#8220;Freaking brilliant - I never heard of this guy before&#8221;. I do believe he was in Danger Danger before he went solo a ways back.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you use referenced masters in Aperture 3 you are probably going to want to know about this. Especially if you use them on multiple volumes. Somewhere along the way, maybe with the initial release of Aperture 3, maybe later, I cannot be sure. Aperture stopped working the way it used to in Aperture 2 with respect to changing out a volume of referenced masters with a backup volume.</p>

<p>Say you have your Aperture library on volume &#8220;V1&#8221; and a second drive with all your masters called &#8220;V2&#8221;. You also have a backup of &#8220;V2&#8221; called &#8220;V2backup&#8221;. In the past if your &#8220;V2&#8221; drive went bad all you needed to do was hookup &#8220;V2backup&#8221;, rename the volume to &#8220;V2&#8221;, fire up Aperture and off you went. Done. With Aperture 3 you also need to use &#8220;locate masters&#8221; to reconnect all the masters on the drive. If you don&#8217;t they will continue to be disconnected.</p>

<p>This is not a huge deal because the &#8220;locate masters&#8221; in Aperture 3 seems to work a little more reliably than it did in Aperture 2 but all the same it is not as convenient as it was and a potential pit fall when recovering from an drive failure. I discovered this a few weeks ago when attempting to help out a fellow Aperture user with drive issues. I then made sure that the behavior was the same on my systems since this is something that I had not tested yet.</p>

<p>The funny thing is I cannot tell if this was an accident or an intentional change. I cannot imagine why Apple would think that anyone would want it to work this way. The reason this happens is that Aperture stores the volume UUID (virtually impossible to change by normal people) along with the volume name and path of the referenced files. The way that it seemed to work in the past was that Aperture used the volume name if it existed and the volume uuid if the volume name changed - this way Aperture would help you out if you renamed the volume via the volume uuid AND it would work by renaming a backup to the same name as the original volume. In Aperture 3 the UUID must match or Aperture will not recognize the volume as the same even if the paths, file names, and file attributes are all identical with out the explicit reconnect via &#8220;locate masters&#8221; on your part.</p>

<p>If you do not like this behavior I implore you to submit feedback to Apple.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Remember the other day when my site was down for say oh&#8230;.. most of the day. Yep it was freakin&#8217; Wordpress again. It only took me about an hour to debug and fix but considering I do this for free and had somewhere else that I had to be when I discovered the hacking&#8230; I left and fixed it later.</p>

<p>Now here is the deal - I am a little unconventional in that I hate typing in a little crappy web text box, I hate the available image upload utilities for WP, I hate all of it. So I used a kludged together system where I can post a google doc which then posts to my WP blog - unfortunately the entire chain of WP specific crap was put together by shoemakers or something - definitely not technology people so it barely works. This has nothing to do with the site hack but the site hack is a symptom of the same set of issues. A bunch of really crappy ugly code black taped together.</p>

<p>Combine that with the popularity of Wordpress and the relentless searching of better programmers for hacks of any site that gets more than like 2 subscribers and it is a pain in the a$$. Now - my Apache site itself seems secure enough - never been hacked - my unix install seems secure enough - never been hacked - etc. The only thing is WP. The funny part is that the hacks have in all cases been exploits of the PHP, not the surrounding technology. I am not even very careful about the surrounding technology - I just make sure things have passwords that is about it - in fact you can find many many things open on my systems that &#8220;shouldn&#8217;t&#8221; be - I wish these had something to do with the WP exploits - they don&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Anyway - I fooled around for about 15 minutes this weekend and converted EVERYTHING. Now I have not had a chance to write all the CSS/SASS along with some other stuff but all of my content is there and all my metadata is there and I can serve it dynamically or statically and&#8230; and&#8230; check it out at my <a href="http://ruby.rwboyer.com/">current domain</a> or even the weird and whacky wonderfulness that allows me to <a href="http://rwboyer.github.com/">host it at Github</a> with a git push - amazzzing. Wow now I can use any editor I want.</p>

<p>So - If I do not become un-pissed-off in the next day or so I am giving Wordpress the heave-ho. If any of you ever wondered why I have not put up a better discussion system/forums/etc it is mostly because of my complete distaste for the mess of a disaster that is Wordpress PHP and all the crap that goes along with it. Themes - plug-ins - all of it. With very few exceptions it is complete crap. I cannot stand to mess with it so I avoid it. If I do convert to homegrown technology I will probably spend a couple hours integrating some decent forums - discussions - etc - etc.  If you think it is not a giant mess take a look the CSS for this site (yea I stole it and hacked it for my needs but I would never bother to make it nice - look at the ugliness) Wordpress - &#8220;code is poetry&#8221; my ass.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am not a big fan of FLICKR - ever since they cancelled my paid account about a month into it and get this&#8230; I never ever even received an email about why. This made me so angry that I tried for 3 months to contact anyone at Flickr and Yahoo to no avail. I sent emails, I tried every single means in every single channel after digging and digging - Nada, nothing. Not a peep as to why. No response.</p>

<p>So I guess I will try this&#8230; Pretty neat for free.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>17 Apr 2010 - Along Way From Home</h2>

<p>Well, I am sick and tired of WordPress. Really I am sick of the whole mess that is PHP land. A long long time ago in a galaxy far far away, I was a software developer for about 18 years - accidently. You see I went to school for Physics and Math and chucked in a CompSci major for the fun of it then accidently spent 18 years screwing around with computer crap. Then I sort of semi-retired and did the commercial photography thing - then I got sick of it when it felt just like.</p>

<p>Anyway here we are. Every time I mess around with my site I have to fix somebody&#8217;s crappy PHP code. The issue is some of the stuff I want to get done with it leaves me&#8230; dreading looking at the mess of fork-lift reuse and horrendously bad crap that is WordPress plug-in&#8217;s, themes, etc, etc. I really wouldn&#8217;t mind if it was even remotely elegant, clever, cool&#8230; pretty but it is not. When I came across this stuff in my professional life I &#8220;refactored&#8221; it - a nice way of saying ditch it and start over. The problem is that I really do not want to write software any more - if I did I would. The pay is fantastic. Now I enjoy fooling around with a few things here and there for pure recreation. When doing that I will only use the tools I actually love to use. I can write C in my sleep and as long as any code that touches mine is fantastically good I don&#8217;t mind that. Forget C++, not because it is bad - it is just the majority of the frameworks blow and again it is a hopeless mess done mostly by people that have not a clue. Cutting to the chase the two things I am willing to mess with at this point are Obj-C (just for the cool Cocoa frameworks so I can mess with new Apple stuff and my real love - Ruby.</p>

<p>Not that Ruby is a holy grail or anything - it is just the community is sooooo.. much different. It seems that language, and all of the frameworks, and conventions, and tools were brought into existence by software developers - real ones. Where PHP and the world around it seems to be the creation of VB knuckle heads and a few McDonalds fry cooks that hacked around in a Wordpress theme for a couple of weeks to get it to work. So&#8230; I think I might abandon Wordpress, the entire reason I use it is that I didn&#8217;t want any &#8220;computer work&#8221; while publishing my little blog. Trying to navigate that WordPress plug-in mess to find things that actually work and work the way I want them to is a nightmare. If I am going to have to screw with this stuff for more than 10 minutes then I may as well just do it myself - or at least the parts that I want to.</p>

<p>Here is my rediculously quick and dirty &#8220;conversion&#8221; of the old site with virtually no work. Behind the scenes there is a lot going on here, I just didn&#8217;t feel like dealling with the CSS for the other stuff yet. The really cool part is I actually wrote a custom WordPress converter in IRB that took 5 minutes with DataMapper and then grabbed a copy of the source of <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> and coverted it to use HAML AND SASS so I wouldn&#8217;t have to blow my brains out closing HTML tags. Heck I use HAML/SASS to create any HTML or CSS that I have to do vs getting some sort of repetitive motion injuries from all the </screw you> nonsence.</p>

<p>The other really nice thing is that I can either host it statcally as I am doing over on <a href="http://rwboyer.github.com/">GitHub</a> or I can do it dynamically. The best part is for all the parts that need to be dynamic - as in server side code - I can just write them as lightweight web services with RACK/Sinatra.
Yes I think I am done with the whole PHP/Wordpress shitty ass mess.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a rel="lightbox" href="/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/2001_042_10.jpg"><img title="2001_042_10.jpg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/.thumbs/.2001_042_10.jpg" border="0" alt="2001_042_10.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="100" align="left" /></a>Take it from somebody that has been shooting images for 40 years. I have had my prolific years and my lean years. I am saying that in an overall photographic sense - not just a commercial sense. I have taken breaks that have lasted from 6 months to 3 years. When I say break I mean a total break, no camera, no images - none. I have self assessed as most of us do in all endeavors. I have searched my soul to figure out why I make pictures. I have gone from one end of the photographic universe to the other and back again in terms of formats, medium, and far more importantly, subject matter. Here are a couple of really simple things that I have found to be true - for everyone - at least to a degree.</p>

<p>My photographic work and my enjoyment of the endeavor in all ways fares better when my options are limited either through choices I make or the circumstance I happen to find myself in. I am not kidding. Take a look at this for a second - my work AND my joy - better. This is coming from someone that values freedom over and above everything- well at least on par with truth. That may seem contradictory at first glance but it is actually quite congruent.</p>

<p>Imagine for a moment that you could photograph just about anything you want - really. Anything at all - all of us can. Now imagine you had whatever resources you needed to do that - equipment, funds, access, materials, budget. Also imagine that you had the skills that to make it all look anyway you wanted it to. The skills of every single solitary link in the chain that leads to the final image. No obstacles. None whatsoever. Everyday you wake up and you ask yourself what am I going to photograph today? What equipment, materials, techniques, lighting, post processing treatment, location, background, paper, printer, large format, medium, lens, and all of those choices were yours to make with no limitations on availability or skill to maximize their use. Would you make good work? I doubt it.</p>

<p>The funny thing is that when you first fall in love with photography and your options are severely limited all of the above seems like photographic utopia. There is a quest to remove those obstacles and there should be or none of us would make very good images because of the severe limitations from far too many perspectives. So you do need to achieve some degree of competence. It is a worthwhile quest. Now here is the tricky part. At some point your options become so broad that every image becomes a massive decision making process that seriously compromises the subject for the sake of the process. This is why I do not shoot commercial work any longer. The subjects became meaningless to me - like some stupid parlor trick. And for my next trick&#8230;watch me pull the rabbit out of my hat&#8230;. wwwoooooo.</p>

<p>Fantastically boring and worse completely meaningless. If you want to make better images and have way more fun doing it limit your options early. This takes a lot of discipline and even more guts. The more skill you acquire the more guts it takes. Trust me on this. Your images will thank you - trust me on this as well. Really take a hard look that the images you like the best - yours and other peoples. Take a look at the images that survive a decade or more and suffer the slings and arrows of time, context, taste, fashion, fad. I can say with 99.9% confidence that they were made under severe limits - probably more limited that what you access to right this second. The photographers that make them generally limit themselves one way or another to very specific subject matter that interests them - to materials and medium, ruthlessly eliminating anything that gets in the way of their connection with the subject. Try it sometime for yourself. Give yourself NO choices photographically make a decision in less than one minute on ONE subject, ONE lens, ONE treatment (black and white/color/print size/final output, all of it in less than one minute), this is really hard to do in the digital age. Shoot with whatever equipment you can carry - without a camera bag, just in your hands.</p>

<p>Just do it.</p>
