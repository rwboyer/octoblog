  <div class="entry-content"><p>About 3000 people have shot me an email asking me &#8220;why did you decide on the LX5 vs the S95&#8221;. To tell the truth, it was a tough call. Both of these cameras are really nice and both the S95 and LX5 will do pretty much the same job. I cannot definitively say which one is better. I can say the factors that shoved me towards the LX5, so here goes. I am not reading off of spec sheets here, I rarely do that. If you want, do it yourself.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Better lens on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_ss_i_5_9%26field-keywords%3Dpanasonic%2520lx5%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%26sprefix%3Dpanasonic&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">LX5</a> - this is just my visual impression and could be argued.</li>
    <li>Wider lens on the LX5 - this one cannot be argued 24e on the LX5 vs 28e on the S95.</li>
    <li>I like the controls better on the LX5</li>
    <li>I like the build quality and feel of the Panasonic vs the Canon.</li>
    <li>Full manual control of exposure, focus and zoom for Video on the LX5.</li>
    <li>I really like the way the &#8220;My mode&#8221; works with the LX5.</li>
    <li>Oh - The LX5 is much much faster than the S95. It feels really quick shot to shot and the focus seems faster to me but that was not some sort of scientific test.</li>
    <li>My own casual evaluation of image quality at the ISO&#8217;s I actually use seemed to suit my taste better.</li>
    <li>I like the little side grip on the LX5 (something the Leica version doesn&#8217;t have) Hmmm, lets remove the grip, add the red dot and charge $500 more. Bullshit.</li>
    <li>No EVF on the S95</li>
</ul>


<p>So what does the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3DCanon%2520S95%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">S95</a> have going for it? Well to tell you the truth, the only thing that I can see is that the S95 is slightly smaller and has a more &#8220;pocket friendly&#8221; profile. Honestly as pockets go there are two kinds of pockets that will fit either of these cameras. The first type are pockets that are too small for either. The second kind are pockets that would be comfortable for either - like a big jacket or coat pocket. Who cares - In my reality you can either stick either one in the pockets you have or not. In my jeans neither would be too comfortable. In my shirt? Are you kidding? In my coat - both are fine.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Remember I said that I use Flickr as a research tool to get a good sense of how a camera reacts prior to actually putting money out? Well I did when I was buying a GF1, I was cleaning up my desk top where I drag links to out of habit today and came across <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/skyorange/sets/72157624879404987/with/5011203481/">this photographer</a> that does not take pictures for a living that uses a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB002MUAEX4%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Ddp_olp_new_map%26qid%3D1285113543%26sr%3D8-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">GF1</a>.</p>

<p>What struck me about her Flickr images is that they are very good and very thoughtful and nobody seems to give a crap. Not that is a giant issue but she has like not one comment on her Vietnam set. Maybe everyone is far too into post processing to give these even a first look but I for one actually think that not only is this an outstanding example of the GF1 being used in the way it should be but also of some very credible travel photography. Actually more than credible - if she were doing this full time she could shoot for a number of dead tree establishments. Take a look. Let me know what you think.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P1000377-full.jpg">Actually a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB002RARGOO%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dsr_1_1_olp%26qid%3D1284830338%26sr%3D8-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Foveon sensor with a DP1s camera wrapped around it</a>. I have been playing with these Stigma, no Enigma, no Sigma cameras with strange and wonderful cameras for years. I have never actually been nuts enough to buy them. I have played with them through other photographer friends that are the lunatic fringe types.</p>

<p>To tell you the truth I have actually liked the color and image look they produce for SOME things but the cameras have been so bad, so poorly designed, so crude, so clumsily implemented, so ugly, and priced so high that I never dreamed of actually buying them. Check out the used market - even used these lunatics that buy them want crazy money for 10 year old digital technology that was poorly done then.</p>

<p>So what possessed me? Well for less than 300 bucks how could I refuse. My rationale is that it actually saves me money because it takes up so much space in my <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2010/09/13/another-money-saving-idea/">new hard-limit camera bag</a> that it will stop me from buying something for like a 1000 bucks. That&#8217;s a 700 savings right there. That and I have convinced myself if I really don&#8217;t want it I will sell it on eBay for like 400 bucks to these Foveon maniacs about a month after Amazon runs out of them at this price.</p>

<p>I would tell you what I think but the battery is charging right now. We&#8217;ll have to wait a little. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. I told you I was on a small camera binge - this is just a warm up for that Fuji X100.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Namely, some people say that I am getting too cranky in my old age. I guess this is true but&#8230;</p>

<p>I really need some help in determining if my burning desire to be really really nasty to <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2586239&amp;start=0&amp;tstart=0">this ASSHAT</a> is just my crankiness or did I wake up on the wrong side of bed this morning or should I just give up on trying to participate over on that Aperture forum?</p>

<p>Maybe its just me being overly agitated over how long these 20x30 print files are taking to ftp, that is about the only time I visit that place any more. So maybe I am just pre-cranky-ized. Hmmm.</p>

<p>Seriously - WTF. I have re-read this like 6 times to figure out if I accidentally called him names or something? What am I missing here?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P1010082-full.jpg">2010 has seen, in my opinion, some really nice small cameras. Heck I bought into them for the first time this year. 2011 Is shaping up to be the year of the great small camera. The three small high quality image making devices that I just purchased are very much useable, fun, reasonably fast, and make great images. Next year looks to turn up the juice substantially. I still believe that the micro 4:3 system is a great compromise and will continue to buy into it.</p>

<p>Does that limit me - know. I am not a zealot. I love all the small high quality devices that are out there duking it out. <a href="http://www.finepix-x100.com/">The Fuji X100 is absolutely on my list of must have cameras</a>. You can bet this will find it&#8217;s way into my gear inventory. This one really fires a shot across Leica&#8217;s bow - especially on the overpriced/under features <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB002NX13QC%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dsr_1_1_olp%26qid%3D1284994749%26sr%3D8-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">Leica X1</a>. It would not surprise me in the least if Leica either lifted some of this design directly for the X2? or even incorporated some of the features in to the M series. In my dreams Leica would enter the micro 4/3 market with an interchangeable lens camera a lot like this w/ a fantastic sensor as well as a dedicated line of premium Leica glass in micro 4/3 mount.</p>

<p>Maybe a Panasonic GF2 that works like this? Who knows but I for one am excited that we are finally seeing cameras that carry on the tradition of the Nikon 28 Ti, The Contax T series, The real Ricoh GR, etc, etc. Whether fixed or interchangeable lens finally some really nice cameras that are not compromised on image quality. Maybe even Sigma will get off their butt and make one of these with that Foveon chip. Actually they would do fantastically with a camera just like this that had a mechanical RF as they have proven that either they or the technology is hopeless at good AF.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I receive so many questions regarding Aperture 3 via email it&#8217;s not funny. Some of them are actually extremely complicated but you would be surprised how many are very simple things. I typically don&#8217;t post about this kind of stuff because I have been using Aperture so long that for me it appears that &#8220;everybody knows that&#8221;. I guess I am wrong so I am going to try a series of &#8220;Aperture 3 - Super Simple Stuff&#8221; kinds of things based on things I respond to in email, etc.</p>

<p>If it is totally redundant information please let me know an I will not waste the global internet bandwidth or my time on it. If it provides any insight say so. I will kick it off with a question that comes up so often I cannot believe it. I guess it has to do with the mindset you need to take when using Aperture - namely - try the simple way first, it will usually just work. The topic is searches and smart albums using a range of dates or for that matter times on a particular date.</p>

<p>If you take a look at all the stuff that has to do with dates and times in the search HUD there are about a million ways to go about this. My advice is to go the simplest route. As an example if what you are trying to do is simple like showing every image between date and time X to date and time Y you are doing it wrong if you feel the need to start adding a bunch of search criteria having to do with date. Saying it a different way, If the calendar criteria isn&#8217;t going to do exactly what you want, use something else. For our purposes just use the EXIF date criteria.</p>

<p>You can type pretty much anything that makes sense in the box after selecting the &#8220;in the range&#8221; option from the drop down. Here I am going to take a look at all the test images I shot with my LX5 in crappy midday light, say from 11am to 4pm. Just type that in. Like so&#8230;</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/date.jpg"></p>

<p>Hmmm, most of them. I am a terribly lazy photographer before coffee in the morning and around dinner. Wow. Okay let narrow it down to a single day within that project. I am lazy and I have no idea what dates are what in that project. Heck I have to look up today&#8217;s date. I am not going to do that. Aperture knows what dates are in the project. I don&#8217;t feel like typing in DD/MM/YY either. You could if you wanted to or that was easier. I am just going to add a calendar criteria to my existing search like this.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/calendar.jpg"></p>

<p>Look mom, only the dates of images currently displayed are highlighted. Very cool now I will just check the Tuesday box and that looks better. See that was the first day I got the camera so I have an excuse for shooting in horrible light. The point is try the easy way, it will probably work. Most of the time if you type something in that Aperture cannot deal with it will tell you in a pop-up what it will deal with. Very cool.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay so I have had this camera for a couple of days and given a few initial thoughts. One of the things that I have not commented on is image quality apart from saying that RAW is actually worthwhile with the LX5. I am still not prepared to discuss image quality in any depth as I have not used the camera under a variety of conditions and have done no controlled evaluations as of yet. Gimme a break I have three brand new cameras to play with at the moment.</p>

<p>The one thing that I have to mention is that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB003WJR69E%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Ddp_olp_new%26qid%3D1284841313%26sr%3D8-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">Leica lens on the LX5</a> is no joke. I am going to test the crap out of it to figure out it&#8217;s flaws but as far as lenses go, the LX5 rocks. The first few images that I shot and evaluated casually were fantastic. Well at least the first impression was fantastic, I expected that and subconsciously chalked it up to what looks like a pretty good JPEG engine doing a lot of post processing/sharpening/etc.</p>

<p>I was wrong, not about the JPEG engine being any good but about the impression of image quality being mostly due to a highly tuned JPEG process. The fact is that those first impressions seem almost entirely due to the fantastic lens that happens to be attached to the front of the LX5. Here is a casual shot that was hand held and shot using full auto. I choose the focus point to be the bottom foliage of the flower.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P1000080-full.jpg"></p>

<p>Let&#8217;s look a little closer, namely at all the pixels. Something we will never see in a print. Here is a crop with NO sharpening, post processing, nothing. Make sure you click on it and use the icon in the light box to see the whole thing.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P1000080-crop.jpg"></p>

<p>Is the lens pretty good? I would say so. Almost wide open, great flare performance, no decreeable CA, no horrendous distortion at 24mm. Remember the crop is from the edge of the frame. Great contrast, great color rendition, nice tonal separation/gradation.</p>

<p>As I said this lens is definitely not a joke.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P1000305-full.jpg">Just wanted to give you people out there some news. Something happened that actually makes the Sigma DP1s more attractive to me. It happened within an astonishingly short time. I have never talked about this camera but it has been under my consideration since it was released. Actually all of the DP camera. My hangups about them were typical. Too slow, foveon sensor math (translation = it&#8217;s not even 5 megapixels, NOT 14 megapixels), no real high ISO to speak of, and no real justification for the stratospheric price.</p>

<p>At some point in the very recent past you can a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB002RARGOO%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dsr_1_1_olp%26qid%3D1284830338%26sr%3D8-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">DP1s for $299 brand spanking new</a> from Amazon. Now that is interesting because the lens is really good and the images even though only 4.8 ish megapixels are actually quite good form RAW files that I have sampled from various photographic situations. That prices is a whopping two hundred bucks cheaper than it was selling for last time I looked and that was kind of cheap at $499 compared to when I was looking at them. You can&#8217;t even find a used one for near $299.</p>

<p>This is probably the result of the DP1x but wow. If any over you are in the market for this very specialized camera I can say that if you can live within it&#8217;s parameters it does make stunning images. I may get one just to save me money and stopping me from buying anything else. You see, $299 is far cheaper than just about anything else I could possibly buy to f<a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2010/09/13/another-money-saving-idea/">ill up my new gear limiting camera bag</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple of readers sent me some email regarding RAW+JPEG work-flow questions. Most of them were very specific to their particular needs so I won&#8217;t go into the gory details of my replies to them. Too boring. I will publish some additional thoughts here and there as time permits because what I consider an obvious work-flow is not so obvious to a lot of Aperture users out there. That and the RAW+JPEG option is something that a lot of people haven&#8217;t explored that much.</p>

<p>I never shoot RAW only, never have and probably never will. I used to shoot JPEG only but not any more. The only reason that I used to shoot JPEG only is when memory cards were small and expensive. Now that I am no longer constrained in any meaningful way RAW+JPEG seems to me as the only way to go. I guess my first digital camera (Nikon D2H) supported RAW+JPEG so well and so fast I never really thought about shooting just RAW. I have never been mired down in any kind of RAW vs JPEG debates and never even saw the point of that debate since I could have both all the time. Having said that, I do use the JPEG files most of the time unless there is a real need to use the RAW files from a quality, correction, or manipulation standpoint. I am really not into screwing with every single frame I shoot. Especially if I like the out of camera JPEGs.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2010/09/13/aperture-3-file-import/">My last post was how time saving RAW+JPEG</a> shooting and importing during the initial stages of an Aperture 3 work-flow and then using the option to import matching RAW files for only the images that you really want the RAW files. I will post something on the 17,000 ways to use that next week. For now I wanted to point out an obvious use of Aperture 3 and RAW+JPEG shooting when your camera doesn&#8217;t have RAW support in Aperture 3 (yet). What I am about to explain isn&#8217;t a &#8220;normal&#8221; work0-flow but it is workable for a while.</p>

<p>Consider this - Aperture 3 will import RAW+JPEG pairs even if the RAW file format is not supported. Yep - this is the case with my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WJR69E?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003WJR69E" target="_blank">Panasoic LX5</a>. For me I don&#8217;t really care because this is what I do as a matter of habit:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Shoot RAW+JPEG</li>
    <li>Import JPEG only</li>
    <li>Go through and reject images that I don&#8217;t want.</li>
    <li>Either import RAW for everything that is not rejected or use a selection for things I want the RAW files for using the import matching RAW functions.</li>
    <li>Using this work-flow, the JPEG is the master that is active by default.</li>
    <li>If the camera is not yet supported, I just use &#8220;show in finder&#8221; via the context menu to have direct access to the RAW master that I am interested in.</li>
    <li>From that point I use open with&#8230; in the finder to use whatever RAW decode I wish.</li>
</ol>


<p>The only extra step is really importing the finished product into Aperture right next to the other masters. No big deal. This kind of thing even works for managed libraries. You just have to do a &#8220;relocate masters&#8230;&#8221; for the image you are interested in. When you are done just use &#8220;consolidate masters&#8230;&#8221; to put the masters back. Obviously this is not fantastic if you are in the habit of screwing with every RAW but that is workable as well, remember Aperture 3 will do everything I just said on any selection of images.</p>

<p>You might be asking &#8220;why  bother&#8221; if Aperture doesn&#8217;t support the RAW files yet. Well, I can do the entire front end of my work-flow from import, reject, rate, metadata, organize, file the masters, create directories based on project automatically, etc, et, the whole nine yards, then bring the RAW in using Aperture 3. This is so fast it&#8217;s crazy and far easier than using finder or something that works like finder to do it. So&#8230; it&#8217;s a little tiny bit slower (as in one step) when I have to monkey with my RAW files - so what?</p>

<p>Try it - if you have any questions just ask.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is not a lens test it is a quick follow up on something I noted the other day regarding a difference in color rendition between the Olympus micro 4/3 kit lens and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Foffer-listing%2FB002IKLJVE%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Ddp_olp_new_map%26qid%3D1284664621%26sr%3D8-1%26condition%3Dnew&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Panasonic 20mm f/1.7</a>, I refuse to use the word pancake, crap I just used it. Okay that is the last time I will use that, whey the heck does everyone want to call lenses pancakes?</p>

<p>Any how - I was right, there is a difference in color rendition. Unless you are OCD on this type of thing you won&#8217;t notice really. The funny part is that the rendition is only to some colors. Here is a quick and dirty &#8220;test&#8221; both shot on the E-P1</p>

<p>Frist the Olympus 14-42</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9160621.jpg"></p>

<p>Next the Panasonic 20mm</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/P9160627.jpg"></p>

<p>Yea, yea - I know the focus is different, and I know there is a slightly different exposure but that is not what I am looking at. These were both shot at a fixed daylight WB with seconds of each other in very consistent lighting color. The hue (not saturation and luminance) the actual hue value is almost identical for the more neutral tones in the straw hat. The difference is in the blues and greens in the ribbons. The hue is massively different to my eyes. As measured it&#8217;s about 8-10 points more toward blue - in other words cooler.</p>

<p>My personal preference is the Panasonic&#8217;s color rendering but it doesn&#8217;t really matter you would never really know if you weren&#8217;t looking at them side by side. I know you are going to say that this is all in my head but Leica lenses have the same kind of color rendering difference as compared to say a Nikon lens on the same film. Maybe Panasonic is using Leica designed coatings?</p>
