  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, we have all been reading about the wonders of new stuff to replace our old stuff. Well at least we have if we follow what is going on in the Ruby world even a little bit. Specifically there has been <em>a lot</em> of hub-bub and controversy about NGINX over Apache and Unicorn over Mongrel with increasing frequency in the past year or a little longer.</p>

<p>At first the news was pretty lopsided. NGINIX is <em>WAY</em> faster than Apache and Unicorn is <em>WAY</em> better than Mongrel. Lately there has been a lot of blowback along the lines of <em>Hmmmm, not really</em> Apache/Passenger is fine and works great and has a <strong>BETTER</strong> scaling model. Granted a lot of that blowback has been generated by Passenger developers along with vague references to the <em>next version</em> but still&#8230; It was time to find out for myself. Up goes a bunch of test instances on both EC2 and Rackspace for some playing.</p>

<h2>Bottom Line and Disclaimers</h2>

<ul>
<li>I am not running either NGINX or Unicorn in production</li>
<li>All of my upfront conclusions are based on really small server instnaces</li>
<li>What I am looking at and care about may be <em>way</em> different than you care about.</li>
</ul>


<p>Okay, with that out of the way I can say that SSL processing in NGINX is way more better (read efficient) than it is on Apache. I cannot see how this could be a whole lot different for anybody unless they are doing somthing special with Apache and SSL termination, in which case you could do the same thing with NGINX. For me, I always terminate SSL in the webserver. Historically this has been far easier and less costly to scale than more specialized solutions that get very old very quick.</p>

<p>NGINX seems to use a lot less memory than Apache for the same connection load when nnly proxying and serving static content. Of course this could be way different if Apache or NGINX are doing way different jobs for you than the simple job I tested and normally use. This includes any heavy module use of any kind. Look before you leap. An example could be as simple as Apache having a way better rewrite module than NGINX - I have no idea&#8230; yet.</p>

<p>Bottom line. On a really small server instance I can proxy to almost as many app servers as I can imagine - amazing.</p>

<p>On to Unicorn. Unicorn is going to make my life a lot easier or at the very least, my servers a lot less complicated. With most of my experience over doing it with the queing / buffering at too many layers is a recipie for problems. Especially where there is no need for it. Of course you want to do it if whatever is on the other front-end is somehow the constraint and cannot stand to be held up for even a moment but if that thing (like a multi-threaded, multi-process, multi-connection webserver) is already doing that job quing requests is useless. It doesn&#8217;t make stuff go faster, or increase capacity. In every app I have ever seen, no matter what the underlying tech, doing this just exacerbates the <strong>pain</strong> when you run out of juice at the end of the line or obfuscates intermittent issues.</p>

<p>Having said that I am all for Unicorn&#8217;s request distribution mechanism. Screw the aledged thundering herd issue. You have to be an idiot if you have to scale that big and can&#8217;t avoid that with like more than one Unicorn, on maybe more than one socket. At the end of the day I can get rid of some of the sanity checking and automated bullshit clearing stuff that is running on my servers. Unicorn has a lot of features built in that make deployment/managemet pretty simple without a bunch of dispariate tools wired together at home. I&#8217;ll take that anyday. If I need some monitoring and control on top of that I will probably add BluePill but I am definitely rethinking my current overly complicated mess when I deploy Unicorn in production.</p>

<p>Oh you want some numbers? Okay but that will have to wait a tiny bit. I plan on doing some more formal analysis on both Rackspace and EC2 this week and over the weekend.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>h2. Preface</p>

<p>What prompted this series of random thoughts was partly a rash of <em>switching from Textmate to Vi</em> posts of late and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/haml/browse_thread/thread/f52b6750507b478">the funniest thing I have ever read</a>. That rant has nothing to do with Textmate to Vi but the context sort of brought the whole thing to a strange focus for me.</p>

<p>In the beginning most of these young innovative web dudes and dude-ettes came up mostly from the M$ Windoze world because that is what they had at home.Upon doing stuff that actually had to work they kinda figured out that Linux/Unix was &#8220;good on the server&#8221;. Then came like this Ruby stuff, really really cool. Now we all know how painful Ruby is on a Windoze box (<em>actually everything is painful on Windoze but you don&#8217;t really know that until you see something like Ruby that doesn&#8217;t have a next, next, next, next, next &#8220;wizard&#8221;</em>). So next comes the move to OS X for these guys/gals. Wow, this works great (shortly there is a realization that this is actually Unix with a way better couple of subsystems al la Apple) and there is this cool thingamagig that you <em>must</em> have called Textmate.</p>

<p>So the word gets around that if you want to do Ruby you gotta have Textmate and that only works on OS X and a Mac. Somewhere the whole Ruby on Unix thing sorta gets subsumed in the Textmate thing.</p>

<p>Fastforward a little bit. Git. Holy crap, this git thing is friggin great. Like Really great. Now you do some cool stuff with Ruby and git hooks and you get github. Wow now we are cookin&#8217;. And&#8230; hey this git thing is actually better on the command line and come to think of it so is a lot of stuff.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s try this Vi thing (or sometimes this EMACS thing - but I am of the Vi church. What do you expect. I have been a BSD guy since the 80&#8217;s).
Man once you get used to it this Vi thing is quite amazing. I was learning all the shortcuts in Textmate anyway but this, this is really living.</p>

<p>2011 - now we have all the Textmate&#8217;rs writing about how to make the transition to Vi. I happen to agree that there is a lot to be said for the Mac and Vi, and, and&#8230; as <em>the</em> development environment of choice for just about anything but .Not, I mean .Net, or is that dot-net, I don&#8217;t know. I just got there from another place. Here I was thinking that I was stuck on Vi because I am an old fuddy-duddy that can&#8217;t seem to retrain some 20+ year old muscle memories. I guess everything that is old is new again. Or&#8230; Maybe it&#8217;s just that some really great ideas are timeless.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s alivvvveeeee. Hey guys and gals. Hope you had a great bunch-0-holidays. Didn&#8217;t want you to think I fell of the earth or anything. I have been running myself ragged. Let&#8217;s see now what have the last few weeks entailed&#8230;</p>

<ol>
    <li>Crazy busy - agreed to take over a buddies tech business while he was away for a month. Holy crap, that was an overcommitment.</li>
    <li>Sick - very very bad case of the flu for like the last week, while still having a bunch of real work to do.</li>
    <li>Oh and three. Spent a tiny little bit of time on that el-cheapo storage appliance for Aperture - you know - this <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2010/12/18/aperture-3-alien-technology-pt-ii/">alien technology™</a> one.</li>
</ol>


<p>Anyhow, it sort of works, and it&#8217;s really really simple. I have a bunch of work to do before it&#8217;s ready for primetime but I have made a bunch of major decisions about it&#8217;s build and it&#8217;s functions. Actually it has been harder to eliminate stuff than to enable stuff. Beta #000001 goes out and will be functional on a real honest to goodness human being&#8217;s work-flow this month.</p>

<p>I have chucked together a quick preview for anyone that wants to get a clue as to what the heck I am talking about. You can try it live - sort of. Of course it&#8217;s as ugly as sin and it&#8217;s not the &#8220;real&#8221; one but it will give you a bit of an idea of where my heads at and what is on my mind. Hey gimme a break I chucked together the UI in like half an hour in my delirium while in and out of bed. It&#8217;s butt-ugly but is a reasonable test bed before I go make it all pretty.</p>

<p>I actually cut out a bunch of stuff that it does in order to reduce the craziness that will go on as a publicly available preview. You cannot get rid of devices or filesystems. It doesn&#8217;t clog-up my real infrastructure or risk panic-ing the kernel so the behind the scenes iSCSI target shifting around does not actually happen in the preview as I have no iSCSI initiators hooked to this thing. It&#8217;s small - really small and resource constrained. It&#8217;s a virtual slice running on file backed disk on my real storage network - so if it goes kaaaaaabooom - it has a snapshot of itself that I will just fire up&#8230;.. Okay enough, so what does it do?</p>

<ul>
    <li>On the home page of the UI you will see an ugly list of all the ZFS file systems that exist. If you click on the name you get a bunch of ugly unformatted details. If you click on &#8220;snapshot&#8221; it will make a snapshot in real time.</li>
    <li>Down at the bottom if you click on &#8220;snapshots&#8221; you can see all the snapshots that exist. On that page you can clone a snapshot into a new and semi-independent file system. You can roll a snapshot back, meaning put the original file system back to where that snapshot was taken, or you can destroy the snapshot.</li>
    <li>To get to the home page just click on the ZFS label in the top right of the page.</li>
    <li>Keep in mind the only file system that has permissions for you to read and write is the one labeled &#8220;zp-0/ftp&#8221; if you want to play around with uploading files snapshoting - blasting them and rolling-back that is the one you can use with the below info.</li>
</ul>


<p>A couple of points to note - there is more stuff that the prototype does but is not on the preview. Most of it actually is about adding and removing devices. All the good stuff happens in the background automagically and uses a set of conventions like the snapshots vs specifying every detail. My aim is to keep the actual functionality very very very simple but not exclude anyone from doing anything that the underlying tech actually can do. There is no database of config that needs to be kept in sync with the real-world all of the stuff that happens is parsed from the source so&#8230; it&#8217;s stateless, if you want to go in and manually change things at a very low level - you can without &#8220;hurting&#8221; or affecting function of the simple UI.</p>

<p>Okay <a href="http://38.102.24.43/" target="_blank">here is the UI</a>. You can use your favorite ftp interface to put files up there and delete them or whatever at the address 38.102.24.43 with a login of public/public - hey go to town. Let me know what you think and definitely ask any questions. I hope you guys blow the thing up. It&#8217;s definitely not got enough kmem allocated for ZFS so it probably will with a bunch of people snapshotting and rolling back. We&#8217;ll see.</p>

<p>On another note one of the tool chains that I love and use for a bunch of stuff unrelated to this (ruby-&gt;haml-&gt;sinatra) made me laugh today as I was googling for some default Rack:: value for sinatra. <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/haml/browse_thread/thread/f52b6750507b478">I some how came across this post on the Haml forum</a>. It has to be one of the funniest things I have ever read. Hilarious.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My holiday traditions have changed radically over my lifetime. I thought I would share some real world holiday trials and tribulations with my photographically inclined readers. I have three daughters as some of you might know. They are all teenagers now but I have as you would expect a bit of experience making photographs of children. If it&#8217;s my children on my schedule, it&#8217;s a labor of love but I know what it takes to do &#8220;good&#8221; photographs of children and it&#8217;s not an exercise that can really be scheduled and forced.</p>

<p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/P1000772.jpg"></p>

<p>My advice to all of the people that want me to &#8220;do pictures&#8221; of their children after seeing some of my triumphs of sheer tenacity is to do it themselves - they will be better than the hour or so that they schedule me to do them. It&#8217;s just how it works. Parents that spend time with their kids can make way better images than a guy/girl that shows up and tries to do it on demand.</p>

<p>Of course not even my family believes this so&#8230; I am elected to &#8220;do the Christmas pictures&#8221; of the little ones in my extended family. Hey, what can I say, people want what they want and do not believe me when I tell them they can do it better. Here is a brief summary of my process for your enjoyment. Of course I have not much say in the actual process, it gets scheduled in when convenient and I just go with the flow.</p>

<p>Phone rings - Hey sister-in-law, what&#8217;s up?</p>

<p>SIL - Can you take some pictures for our Christmas cards? (first week in Dec)</p>

<p>Me - Sure when do you want to do it?</p>

<p>SIL - Hmmm,  ummmm, how about this week-end.</p>

<p>ME - Okay.</p>

<p>Here is the reality - In the northeast it gets dark about an hour after lunch so natural light is out. We have to do it &#8220;after the nap&#8221; and the planned week-end day is after church on &#8220;Holiday Day&#8221;. You know all the holiday stuff needs to get done, grand parents coming over, baking of cookies, dad is home, putting up the tree, ohhh and the pictures. Great - in the middle of all the extra stimulus we get to set up lights and try to get a two and three year old to stay in the same couple of square feet for maybe 10 seconds. Yep ideal conditions.</p>

<p>So what do I do? Just go with the flow - no of course not. I add an extra variable into the mix. I chuck a light in my car and decide to use the itty bitty Panasonic LX-5 to shoot it. What the heck - I just want to see if it can be done.</p>

<p>You will be happy to know that pocket wizards work just fine on the LX-5. They are a little ungainly, the transmitter is about the same size as the actual camera shoved into the hotshoe. The focus is way way too slow for auto-focus so a little pre-focus/manual-focus is in order but it worked. Very cool.</p>

<p>As usual my favorite images (the ones that depict the actual reality of the situation and the 2 year old&#8217;s nature) are forsaken for the more typical &#8220;nice ones&#8221;. Mission accomplished. Yea, not my best work but you try to do it with the cookie baking, mommom and popop trying to &#8220;help&#8221; make them take the picture, a couple of toddlers and shooting tight with a lighting margin of error of about half a foot.</p>

<p>Just thought I would let you people know - if  you are the camera guy/gal this will happen sooner or later. Relax and just soak it in.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/kids-in-cray1.jpg">All I can see is &#8220;color me surprised&#8221;. <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2010/12/15/aperture-3-and-alien-technology/">That little poll I put out after a long and winding diatribe</a> has received way way more response than I expected. What&#8217;s more is that a whopping 70% of respondents actually want to read a long boring eBook about the nitty gritty of forking around with all the bits and pieces of putting together a home-grown alien technology™ storage area network. I am also surprised at the number of people that think they might want to buy a black-box that just works. I had no idea there were that many people that are outrunning the simple way of doing things.</p>

<p>Okay, I guess I will get crackin&#8217; on the eBook. As for the black-box I am building <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/">prototype #000000 for this guy</a>. For those of you that asked here are some of my high level thoughts on what I am going to do for the eBook and the black-box.</p>

<p>First off&#8230;. the eBook. In my minds eye this will not just be a recipe. It will be a list of considerations and decisions to be made when designing and acquiring the parts/software/etc. along with some rationale on why you might want to do what in each phase of the process. Of course it will also have a basic end-game type of recipe to actually build a SAN including the nitty gritty specifics that should work just fine if you happen to make the same exact example criteria decisions as I am making as you follow along with the eBook. How does that sound? Good? Maybe you guys/gals just want a recipe - that&#8217;s simpler but not too too useful as time marches on. Yea right - gals. I would love to see the demographic skew on this eBook.</p>

<p>Now for the eBook and Black-box people, mostly the black-box people but also for eBook people that want to know what kind of minimal example I have rattling around in my head. Here is a simple list of &#8220;must haves&#8221; in my black-box prototype/s:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Full local fault resiliency and transparent recovery from an HD failure.</li>
    <li>Better performance than a locally connected single spindle drive in it&#8217;s most humble config.</li>
    <li>iSCSI target to look like a local drive to your Mac.</li>
    <li>Network drive attachment for flexibility.</li>
    <li>Instant snapshot capability of all managed storage. If you are not familiar with this think of it as the ability to put a stake in the ground at any time you want that you can go back to in an instant if anything logical goes wrong. Say an upgrade to an Aperture library and you want to go right back to where you were without copying/restoring/moving data etc.</li>
    <li>Instant snapshot based cloning and export as iSCSI targets with all underlying data shared/copy-on-write. Hey how does TWO Aperture libraries sound that take the same exact amount of storage as one does? Hmmm wouldn&#8217;t this be great for testing/debug of failed upgrades while continuing to do real work?</li>
    <li>Promotion of clones to separate storage blocks.</li>
    <li>Option to connect at 10 Gig/bits for not too too much money now and way way less down the road. Yep you heard me - that is 10 times faster than your internal drive at a minimum - more like 20 or 30 times faster when you take the throughput of the whole thing in to account vs a single spindle internal SATA drive.</li>
    <li>Low startup cost - like &lt;$1000 for fully redundant 1Gig/s 4 Terabyte fully redundant with all capabilities.</li>
    <li>Low expansion costs - how about &lt;$3000 for 24 Terabytes all in? Yep we are still under the cost of DROBO&#8217;s biggest best thing they&#8217;ve got with 3 times the storage (actually more than 3 times I am being nice here). Oh and you can do a couple of those expansions at declining costs and increasing bigness without changing a single thing. Almost unlimited expansion.</li>
    <li>Option to replicate data to a remote site/cloud</li>
    <li>Etc. etc. along with the ability to control EXACTLY the way it works for the more techno-geek out there.</li>
</ol>


<p>Okay that is what is in my head. A simplified version of my home SAN with a little bit of simplified UI chucked in. No FC, no FC switch, gigabit connections and switch to start out. 10Gigabit point to point as a low cost option. Multi 10Gigabit Multipath if you want it (not cheap yet).</p>

<p>Please give me some feedback on if this is what you Aperture folk had in mind?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/P1000305.jpg">Okay, I have had a few weeks with the new 11.6 inch MacBook Air. I guess you people are wondering if I ended up shooting myself in the head after trying to use it with Aperture 3 or if I was so enamored with it that I no longer felt the need to communicate through the blog anymore. The answer is more towards the nirvana side of things than to the the shoot-self-in-head side of things.</p>

<p>Performance is by no means as good as it could possibly be as related to a MacPro with a Gig or more of VRAM but this little thing is delightful. Way way better than my first gen Core2duo 15&#8221; and not quite as good as my Core i5 15&#8221;. I am declaring the little guy a win for Aperture 3 use. I am sure that people will find faults - most of them will be with piling on lots of GPU heavy adjustments on the same large RAW file and expecting real-time slider performance. If you have issues with that on a modern big Mac - obviously you will have issues with the tiny Air. If you had bad experiences on old-tech shared VRAM machines (a la white MacBook with Intel integrated graphics) you will find the new itty-bitty MacBook Air a dream come true.</p>

<p>I have actually done real work on this thing with real projects and absolutely love it. I use it mostly for stuff I want to do in the field - load images from camera, rate, metadata, quick adjustments and send out proofs kinda stuff. I have NO hesitation using this versus my 15&#8221; Core i5 super-duper MacBookPro. The trade-0ff in speed and real estate vs size and weight is absolutely worth it for me.</p>

<p>Consider it RB endorsed.</p>

<p>RB</p>

<p>Ps. Get the 4Gig and the biggest SSD you can. 128Gig barely cuts it for field work nowadays.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/P1000845.jpg">I have received about seven hundred and 2 thousand e-mails and one-on-one requests for help with Aperture 3. A lot of them have a two common themes. The first one is -&#8221; help my Aperture 3 has fallen and it can&#8217;t get up&#8221;. The second is - &#8220;How comes you never have no Aperture 3 problems?&#8221;.</p>

<p>With respect to the first theme - of course I will try to help you out if I can. Time goes to one-on-one people on a first come first serve basis. I do have a life - sort of. With respect to the second questions I never really answer that, instead I focus on the way that other people actually operate their own little data-center instead and offer what I consider appropriate suggestions based on a lot of factors.</p>

<p>Today I am going to offer a tiny little bit of the way I operate my little data-center and why I don&#8217;t have no Aperture issues. I am also going to ask readers to answer a very simple question at the end before I go off the deep-end with this kind of stuff.</p>

<p>First off I do have &#8220;Aperture issues&#8221;. Probably not a lot - like most people. The real reason I am not going berserk with any of my application software is because I really don&#8217;t give a hoot when it goes wonky. The reason is simple. No matter what happens, no matter how it happens, no matter if it is the software&#8217;s fault or self inflicted. Under any set of circumstances I can get right back to where I was in less than 5 seconds. That is not hyperbole - it is a conservative estimate, assuming I am drunk and can&#8217;t see strait when I initiate the plan B switch. Under better circumstances it takes me about 2 seconds.</p>

<p>Here is the part were the obvious happens - everyone wants to know how and what I do to achieve that. I am not being stingy because I never talk about my underlying technical infrastructure, I am being responsible. I honestly believe answering that question and writing about what I use and how in bit&#8217;s and pieces of techno-babble and alphabet soup will cause more people disaster than not.</p>

<p>The truth is that most people have no need for anything remotely similar to what I do. The truth is not many people that do have the attention span or time to waste in ever managing to implement what I do at home. If you are an Aperture 3 user that is on a trajectory that is the same as the &#8220;Apple plan&#8221; you are golden - no complicated stuff required. That plan is roughly equivalent to all your stuff fits in a current iMac and the amount you add will easily be overwhelmed with the annual capacity increases that we all see in capacity and speed. It this is you - stick to the way Apple wants you to do things and just get decent gear every year. Timemachine has you covered.</p>

<p>If your data storage needs have already outpaced the &#8220;Apple normal people plan&#8221; you need to do something different. A bunch of people have gone the Drobo route. Some have gone the ga-gillion different libraries on a ga-gillion external hard-drives. This route sucks and I would never go there myself. From my point of view the Drobo expensive and doesn&#8217;t actually do much for the price of entry. I guess it is okay for a very narrow group of people but the reality is the Drobo route is lacking functionality and is still a dead-end hard-stop step function that is EXACTLY like the lots-0-external non-managed drive solution. If you are outpacing single device technology so much so that you NEED a Drobo you need something way different than what you do today. Your life is now complicated.</p>

<p>The answer? Hmmm, there is only one in my hard-headed way of thinking, it&#8217;s a SAN. Any storage area network that is halfway reasonable can do just about anything you ever dreamed of in terms of managing your storage in ways that will seem like &#8220;alien technology&#8221; Really it will - I swear. I have been doing SAN stuff since the mid-90&#8217;s back when the only game in town was IBM ESCON clusters. Nothing ever ever goes awry in a way that the end consumers of the application and data ever actually notice. How about zero down-time and outages from an end-user point of view? It&#8217;s like magic. I swear, you really don&#8217;t want to know how it works, you just want to bask in the glory of a never ending, never down, do-anything with reckless abandon with no worries alien technology and have the confidence that you can be back to where you were with the press of a button - no waiting - NOW.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s the rub? Hmmm. Do you have a full-time big data center guy that deals with this crap for you? No well there&#8217;s the rub. Even the most consumer oriented SAN from say Studio Network Solutions will be daunting to any non-IT type regular people out there. Added on to that obstacle is the cost of entry. You haven&#8217;t really experienced sticker shock until you start pricing this kind of thing out from a traditional SAN vendor like EMC2 or even Studio Network Solutions. Apple used to have there own but it&#8217;s pretty much gone by the wayside as I am sure their typical consumer target market don&#8217;t really &#8220;get it&#8221;. IT-guys already have their preferred recipe and there ain&#8217;t no forking way they are going to mix Apple stuff with their storage network.</p>

<p>That brings us to my point - what do I do? I build my own SAN with all of the capability I want for less than the cost of a Drobo. Really. I also do other crap to my own Macs that I would never ever advise anyone to do that isn&#8217;t already doing it. Here is why you have read this so far. You have a need and maybe I can help. I can and I will. Last week I agreed to build a black-box solution for an Aperture buddy of mine that gives him the capability I have with NO changes to his macs. Sort of plug and play. For the cost of a big Drobo with never ending capacity, instant recovery, cloud replication, and&#8230; performance that will DESTROY ANY SINGLE drive solution. Like 320 MBs write throughput.</p>

<p>I have a couple choices on how I might go forward with the couple of you out there that might also appreciate this kind of thing. One - piecemeal posts on how to roll-your-own. Bad idea - just enough info to spend a bunch of money and be really dangerous. A full scale eBook with every single thing laid out. Hmmm&#8230;. Maybe but still not for the feint of heart. Lastly make the &#8220;black box&#8221; solution available pre integrated with Apple and Aperture and provide support to Aperture users. Well not just me - but some other people as well.</p>

<p>I really really would love to hear what your interests are on this subject before I waste a lot of time on any of these approaches to this topic. If you have come this far please take a couple of seonds to think about this and answer this poll. As usual feel free to question or comment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know all  of you are waiting with bated breath to hear how well or poorly my new mini-me MacBook Air does with Aperture 3. The reason for the delay is simply FedEx/Federal Government cock-ups. Yes, it was committed for delivery on Weds but was swallowed up by the dreaded &#8220;clearance delay&#8221;. Whenever you see that big red status on the FedEx tracking page, you could be in for a significant wait&#8230; Depending.</p>

<p>So I did what any lust possessed fool would do. I ordered another one from MacMall that was actually here in the US and had it overnighted. As soon as I hit the order button, I checked the FedEx tracking page again. Now the &#8220;clearance delay&#8221; was cleared and the schedule for delivery was back on for Weds. So&#8230; I called and cancelled the MacMall order prior to it being shipped and waited, and waited, and waited.</p>

<p>Long story short, by 7pm Weds, the estimated FedEx delivery date was GONE. Like no estimate. Grrrrrrrrrrr. WTF? Yesterday was Thanksgiving here in the states so no MacBook for me. FedEx promises it will be here today - Friday. We shall see. This may degrade into armed conflict if I wait around all day and it does not show up.</p>

<p>On a positive note - Apple did offer me a free case for my sorrows.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have you people wondered or maybe fantasized about running Aperture 3 on one of the new MacBook Air&#8217;s when you are in the field? So have I. Of course I have a couple of ulterior motives here. First off the I have plans for the MacBook Air even if Aperture 3 on it turns out to be a complete dog. I plan on using it for writing, coding, <a href="http://rwboyer.github.com/">tech stuff</a> - all mostly text. The one thing I do know is that just about anything remotely recent will crunch my text/writing seven ways from Sunday instantaneously without working even breathing hard.</p>

<p>So, I ordered one. The pint sized one to be exact. Of course I maxed out the memory and SSD drive as much as you could on the mini-me Air. It should be here in a few days. I can hardly wait. As soon as I can get a read on how useful or useless Aperture 3 is on that hardware on that small of a screen all of you will be the first to know.</p>

<p>I am happy with my choice even before it arrives. I have been longing for an Air since it&#8217;s introduction but have consistently found other ways to spend the cash. Heck I have a perfectly good Core i5 15 inch-er with 8 Gig&#8217;s of RAM that runs Aperture 3 without a hitch but I am sick of <em>lugging</em> it around for my light duty work (most of my work from a computing standpoint).</p>

<p>Can you imagine my bliss if it turns out to be workable with Aperture? Just me, my credit card, a fresh pair of underwear, and a micro 4/3 camera to do just about anything I want to do. Sans luggage.</p>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some technology markets astound me. Let&#8217;s take the healthcare market. I am in the process of assisting a medical practice implement a new medical records system. To tell you the truth, this particular system is quite innovative. It&#8217;s built the way I would build it, using technology I would choose today. It&#8217;s delivered as in an ASP model and the client is specificly targed to run on the iPad. Very cool, easy to use, It talks &#8220;doctor&#8221; and knows all of the industry diagnostic codes so that the process of translating the work done to the insurance carrier is <em>automagic</em>. It&#8217;s actually the first system I have seen from a practice automation standpoint that I can really say I could jump on board with no caveats. As in &#8220;it looks okay for something in the medical industry&#8221;. The secret is the people that are behind the company don&#8217;t come from the <em>healtcare technology industry</em>. They come from the world the rest of us live in, you know the 21st century world.</p>

<p>Enough with the preamble. So, this new system has to hook to the old system - a <em>state of the art</em> practice management system to retrieve all the patient info that has already been keyed. No big deal right? Wrong! <strong>Three thousand bucks</strong>. I know what you&#8217;re thinking. You&#8217;re thinking &#8220;that&#8217;s no so bad for coding a bridge to the old data&#8221;. Well you&#8217;re right, it&#8217;s not but that is not what we&#8217;re talking about here. That coding from the new company is <strong>FREE</strong>. Actually there is no real coding, they have a pretty innovative bridge to a bunch of popular systems already done. They also have a bunch of hook-ups to automate ordering reports, diagnostics, etc. The $3000 bucks is to the old software company.</p>

<p>If you aren&#8217;t as tenatious (read pain in the ass) as me, you may not even be curious as to what that $3000 gets you. Well after pulling some threads here is what it gets you. Get ready, hold onto your hats, strap in for this:</p>

<p>The <strong>THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS</strong> buys you the old company installing an ODBC driver on a client machine that already exists and already has access to the old software <em>and</em> the old company types in the presumably hardcoded password to the ODBC driver so that <em>you can access data that you own on a database that you own on software that you own on hardware that you own</em>.</p>

<p>Really - no shit. I can&#8217;t make this stuff up. Great forking business model. Rape your existing customers for delivering no extra value on software that hasen&#8217;t seen a new feature set in a decade. Brilliant stuff. These yo-yo&#8217;s deserve to go out of business.</p>
