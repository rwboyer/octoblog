<p>So a couple of dozen people from all over the map have mentioned that they might be interested in an available light workshop and there were a few inquisitive souls that just had to know what that might be like. I guess the answer is really up to what people would be interested in as my agenda might last a week or a month or longer. That might be a little inconvenient and just a bit grueling for most non-fanatics.</p>

<p>Here is a bit of a brain dump of what kind of things I would guess might be interesting and useful from my perspective. Instead of getting all artsy-fartsy and acedemic in the syllibus I&#8217;ll just use some humor to get the rough outline down and hopefully get some feedback from you. Of course I would actually organize this into something a bit more coherent for the real thing.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Using the light modifiers already built into your environment both indoors and outdoors. AKA - why sunlit concrete is your friend.</li>
    <li>What is open shade and using it to the best effect. Identifying the good open shade, the bad, and the ugly.</li>
    <li>All about windows. North light, diffused sunlight, and bounced sunligt.</li>
    <li>All about rooms - this is the sequel to all about windows. Rooms matter. The size, the color, and most importantly where you situate your subject in them. A special section on corners - all rooms have corners that make for fantastic background effects.</li>
    <li>Beating mid-day sun into submission. AKA Great light without ugly itty-bitty blue colored on-camera fill-flash. Oh and also without reflectors that will drive you nuts even in a mild breeze.</li>
    <li>Why grass is your enemy and some things you might want to think about in vanquishing it.</li>
    <li>Okay, okay - reflectors can be useful. Here are a few ways to use them and here are a couple of improvisations for the finantially ummm&#8230; prudent.</li>
    <li>Some really good reasons you want to use manual mode and something other than matrix/pattern metering.</li>
    <li>Special bonus - everyone is supplied with a manual SLR, wide aperture lens, and one roll of 36exposure Kodak Portra (processing included) to shoot however they want during the workshop - or not and some examples of the joy of shooting color negative film with various effects.</li>
</ul>


<p>Of course I will supply either pro or semi-pro models. Hair + MUA (model calibre depends on price tolorance but all will probably know more than the average bear on directing models and will look good in front of the camera). I am thinking a two day week-end agenda with a discussion in the morning, lots of time and opportunity to work vairous scenes with models. Dinner and discussion with image review in the evening.</p>

<p>Comments? - questions? - suggestions?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay - so I have been screwing around with the presets that I envisioned releasing to all of you Aperture 3 users for months. In case you think that I have been slacking off here - think different. I have come to the conclusion that I cannot release a product that I feel comfortable with. Namely a product that I would find acceptable as a consumer if I was expecting a quick and easy way to duplicate Nikon NX2 or OOC JPEG Picture Control settings.</p>

<p>It has nothing to do with me not understanding the differences in gamma/contrast - saturation - or more importantly color (HSL values) rendered by Nikon NX2 vs Aperture 2 - I have been messing with this since Aperture V1 when the differences were HUGE on the Nikon D2 series of cameras. Since then it has gotten a lot &#8220;better&#8221; but with smaller degrees of the same nagging issues. The problem with packaging a canned solution is that there are too many variables to make a product that is easy to use, makes any sense, saves time and produces results that are close enough for me to be comfortable with.</p>

<p>I have sliced this many many different ways and the color adjustments are highly dependent on the color of the light, WB settings when taking the image, and the scene. Matching a color target under one set of conditions is not going to cut it in real world use. Breaking up the presets with a bunch of &#8220;if this&#8221; then use preset X and preset Y otherwise do something different is too complicated to be of much use. It&#8217;s trying to duplicate what I do with my NEF files depending on too many variables - it&#8217;s easier to just do it yourself visually rather than dealing with interpreting the conditions and wading through a few dozen preset combinations.</p>

<p>So&#8230; I give up. No one set of &#8220;standard, vivid, neutral, portrait, and landscape&#8221; presets is going to produce accurate and acceptable results under diverse real world shooting conditions.</p>

<p>About the only thing that might at all be interesting to you as a consolation prize is the gamma/contrast curves that I use to match Nikon Picture controls - unfortunately this only goes half way. If anyone is interested in just the gamma/contrast/saturation presets without the color I will go through the trouble of posting them for purchase for like a buck or something (need to pay for bandwidth somehow&#8230;) please let me know - and sorry I cannot move this particular mountain&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/11/02/photoplus-expo-whatever/">little rant yesterday</a> on the state of affairs at PhotoPlus may have been a little over the top and a little too anti-gear. Let me clarify just a bit of my thoughts briefly. As photographers we all share a special relationships with the tools that allow us to make images. I admit this freely. If your camera doesn&#8217;t feel good you will not be at your best when using it. If you don&#8217;t get along with it very well, it is not going to be a productive relationship. Using different cameras causes you to make different images. It really does. You have no choice in many many cases. In other cases this might be a bit more subliminal but there none the less.</p>

<p>In this context I was not at all critisizing the denizens of the show. I was just amazed that the conversation always went towards gear. Gear that in my mind did nothing to help me in 99%  of the images that I desire to make. There was nobody talking about how anything at the show related at all to their endeavors as a photographer. They were talking about the gear in isolation. As something to be discussed as an ends in and of itself, without context.</p>

<p>Does everyone else really shoot 5, 8, 10, 12 frames per second a lot? Do they need more speed in order to be capable of dealing with their chosen subject matter? Is image quality only measured by the degree of magnification you get when you hit Option+1 or the &#8220;Z&#8221; key? Does the degree of noise when you shoot images in really really dim crappy light matter that much? Do people really care that much about dim crappy light?</p>

<p>Maybe I am the odd man out here but I have a really good idea about how I want images that I actually care to make look. I have a reasonable idea of what makes me comfortable when I shoot. I have some parameters as to the image aesthetics I desire. I don&#8217;t think my chosen subject matter is that far off from a large portion of photographers out there. I don&#8217;t shoot sports, wildlife, or anything really far away. I don&#8217;t have any reason to shoot in the dark. I like to shoot things relatively close - usually people. I like window light and a few other situations. I know what the exposure equation is. I like small very large aperture lenses. I like solid, small cameras with simple controls. I like big viewfinders. I can take or leave autofocus becuase in my 3-9 foot range (vast majority of the time) autofocus at wide apertures is really not that useful and in most cases counter productive.</p>

<p>I feel really let down by camera makers. They make no digital products anywhere near a reasonable price that I am interested in. Almost without fail they all make the same camera over and over and over and over again. They look the same, they act the same. They are too too big, the sensors are too small to render images the way I like to see them unless I want an even bigger camera. Noise at crazy ISO,s has gone down and image magnification ability has gone up but generally speaking the image quality that I care about in terms of aesthetics is wholely lacking with the exception of crazy big and crazy expensive products.</p>

<p>Where a camera similar to a <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/06/28/new-nikon-digital-camera-annoucement/">digital FM/FE</a>? Where are small light reasonibly priced large aperture lenses? Either crazy expensive or boutique crazy expensive. I can honestly say that I have own not one digital camera that I liked in any way better than most of my film gear. Not one. Too big, too ugly, too heavy, and with minor exceptions (which do not apply to subjects I am interested in) not one helped me in any way to make images that I couldn&#8217;t make before. Not one produced images that I found as aestetically pleasing without a lot of messing around in post let alone &#8220;better&#8221;. We are all a decade into &#8220;product maturity&#8221; and the glow and hope has worn off for me. I am convinced we will get less diversity in design and features rather than more. I am convinced anything that remotely interests me will be priced so far into the stratusphere if they are available that they will make no sense for me to persue.</p>

<p>My reaction to PhotoPlus was to immediately purchase these as soon as I got home. One of them was actually purchased while I was still in NYC.</p>

</a></p>

<p>A silver OM-1, a silver OM-1n, a black OM-1, two black OM-2&#8217;s - on an &#8220;n&#8221; the other a bit older. All of them work fine, the 28mm, 50mm f1.8, 50mm f1.4, and 135mm all came with the cameras and included the little Olympus lens cases as a bonus. I spent about $150 for the lot of them. Why Olympus? Well I already have enough Nikon gear to last me 3 lifetimes, same goes for Hasselblad and I have always love the OM system for it&#8217;s tiny dimensions and giant (not so much with the OM3/4) uncluttered viewfinders and figured I would corner the market before everyone else figured out the digital tread mill blows and the promised land sucks.</p>

<p>I am seriously thinking on doing an available light workshop - I know it sounds kind of lame but have been surprised by how little experience people have at using available light. I put up a post on window light a year ago and joked about a workshop. A half dozen folks have contacted me about participating.</p>

<p>Of course I would not make film a requirement but I am thinking about having a bunch of film cameras available with giant aperture lenses and springing for a roll of portra for anyone that would like to try it during the workshop.</p>

<p>Anyone else interested in a workshop focusing on the subject and using available light creatively? Would it be cool to try out some film in a simple vintage camera while you were there or is that just dumb?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, here is my report from NYC PhotoPlus. I know, I am a terrible reporter as this is old news considering that the event was at the end of last week and anyone that gives a rat&#8217;s a<em></em> was probably being updated via 18 real time feeds. In any case I figured I would give my quite jaded 2 cents.</p>

<p>Overall I was bored. Bored bored BORED. The most exciting thing that I saw was a couple of new papers - actually I didn&#8217;t see them, my buddy did and he told me about them. They sounded really exciting. I know that you think I am nuts getting excited about something like paper but at least that means a couple of us still produce real tangible prints from photos that we bother to make.</p>

<p>For some reason everyone else seemed much more interested in trying to discover what mo-better-faster-stronger-megapixel crap is going to be available to shell out a bunch of money on so they can chuck the stuff they just bought last year. Who cares. There was also a lot of interest in stuff to publish more crappy images faster and faster in higher quantities to the web. I am serious. Yes - more images faster. Like realtime snap-publish.</p>

<p>Color me not impressed. Actually color me depressed. What got me in that state of mind really quick was the casual conversations that I had with folks that I ran into. I swear I did not lead these conversations - I was a passive participant. With one and only one exception in two full days I did not hear anyone bring up anything about anything but gear. Gear, gear, gear, and more gear. Nobody actually talked photographs and what they were doing, why they were doing it or any subject remotely about how their images look. The entire conversation without fail was about gear. The one exception was a long chat I had with a <a href="http://www.modernassembly.blogspot.com/">very interesting woman</a> and I don&#8217;t even remember what kind of camera she was using. Some sort of DX Nikon maybe? We talked about images and subject matter - stuff that is actually the real focus (pardon me - had to say it) of the image making endeavor.</p>

<p>Here is my gear report - short and sweet. Hasselblad and some other medium format camera makers sell some products that will give you really good looking images (sort of like film does) for somewhere between $30,000 and $50,000. Nikon has an itty-bitty camera with an itty-bitty sensor that takes images that look nowhere near as good as film but look reasonable with not a lot of thought. Everyone has gigantic DSLR&#8217;s about three times the size and weight of film SLRs that also make reasonable images in the dark with not a whole lot of noise but generally don&#8217;t look as good as film does but they do it without any thought. They do it fast. They do it WAY better than the DSLR you had last year and will be garbage next year. Whatever reason you images look like crap - the new cameras will fix - until next year. Step right up.</p>

<p>In all seriousness - if bigger, badder, faster is interesting to you Sony is kicking ass in that department. That little flood thing is holding up product at the moment but the latest round of bigger badder faster has Sony producing some seriouly mosterous products. Holy crap. If Nikon and Canon didn&#8217;t have a bunch of brand loyalty and zealotry they would be in huge trouble. Maybe they will be in a year or two. The A77 is a monster for dirt cheap.</p>

<p>There you have it - your somewhat belated report. Entirely objective. If you missed it don&#8217;t worry about it, you didn&#8217;t miss much. If you plan on going next year - plan on bringing some drinking buddies and use it as an excuse to party while doing &#8220;business&#8221;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Long time no see.</p>

<p>I have been crazy busy over the last few weeks. Daughter No. 1 is having her first baby, My friend and colleague just acquired $50K worth of Hasselblad 50 megapixel goodness he needed some help sorting out. A little work on some other projects. Getting ready for a new workshop promotion (not mine - I am helping with the media production for someone else). Tearing my hair out over the D7000 presets, etc, etc. Wrapping things up so that I can take two days off to play around in NYC for photoplusexpo or whatever it&#8217;s called this week.</p>

<p>First off the D7000 color presets. Grrrrr. I have been fiddling with these things for over a month. It&#8217;s not a matter of being done or not done. It&#8217;s more a matter of playing with compromises and usability for something that I am actually going to charge a few bucks for. First off - they are not perfect in every picture taking scenario. They cannot be due to issues I have described before regarding the closeness or lack of differentiation in certain hues. Maddening. This makes me even more curious as to how well the Datacolor calibrator for Aperture 3 actually works considering it uses the same mechanisms I am trying to use for the presets. My bet - not that well depending on how obsessive you are.</p>

<p>In the past I have developed Aperture presets that get me close to what I want in my Nikon cameras and then gone from there with fine tuning of the color based on the scene. In putting together something that I am actually going to charge a couple of bucks for I am trying to somehow bundle my thought process into quick and easy with not a lot of additional thought required to get Nikon shooters to where they want to be. Not easy. Still working on it. Maybe I will just release what I have now at a really low price as version 1 with full disclosure (unlike some other folk that don&#8217;t even mess with the hue issues - huh) and develop a version 2 using customer feedback with what would be most valuable to people&#8230; with a discounted of free update to version 2? Suggestions?</p>

<p>Moving on - color. When I shoot projects for myself I tend toward shooting black and white. I love black and white for my own personal endeavors. Way back when I shot commercial work I shot 99% color and color was very important to me. I have ranted before that for the most part digital color sucks with a few rare exceptions that cost major bucks. It takes way way too much work that I am not interested in doing to make it look &#8220;real&#8221; and &#8220;good&#8221; and &#8220;natural&#8221; - especially skin. Film = shoot and done. Digital = shoot and mess about with it to get it anywhere near as real/good/natural as film. I am not talking about LOUD - loud is easy. I am actually starting to think that as a society our collective visual perception is being dulled and slowly our perception is moving towards only being able to evaluate grotesque differences because of how lousy most of the color we all see everyday in photographs. No subtlety at all. Subtlety and gradation have left the building.</p>

<p>Case in point. Here is a D7000 RAW processed and neutralized - the grays at least via the latest greatest version of Adobe ACR&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/DSC_3063.jpg" rel="lightbox">

</a></p>

<p>And here is the wildest color neg film available, Kodak Ektar 100.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2011-008-28cn.jpg" rel="lightbox">

</a></p>

<p>Yea, yea, yea, I didn&#8217;t focus the film perfectly, I didn&#8217;t even bother to blow the dust of the negative prior to scanning so it&#8217;s gritty and grimy. Yea the digital looks clean and smoooooooooooooooth. Both images have a very similar overall and mid-tone contrast curve. If at all possible try to just look at the color. Some of you may prefer the digital color - my bet if you do is because that is what you are so accustomed to seeing at this point. Now look closer - see the lack of differentiation in the yellow and the green patch above and to the left? Look at the purple patch - now the red - now the blue that is close to a primary. I am sitting here looking at the images as well as the actual color target - forget accuracy, let&#8217;s talk &#8220;real&#8221;. The D7000 version looks sort of like a cartoon compared to the film. In fact that is the real issue - it&#8217;s very much like a cartoon. Deep colors are not &#8220;deep&#8221; - they are thin and just build up saturation. The deeper and more saturated the patch on the chart the more apparent it is. Look at the darkest/deepest/most saturated of all the colors in each image and this should be amazingly evident.</p>

<p>Secret #452: Putting more saturation in is EASY. Taking it out does not improve things or increase subtle gradation - it just makes it dull. Loud cartoony color with no differentiation and subtle gradation is not &#8220;good color&#8221;. Just my opinion.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Nope, not another excuse or explanation about my bogus post the other day&#8230; Just some answers to a bunch of questions that I received via email over the last week regarding the, how, what, why, where, on the D7000 presets for Aperture 3. So not in any order here we go&#8230;</p>

<p>What is the issue here, why the need for presets, and what do you mean when you talk about the color being &#8220;off&#8221;. Answer &#8230; hmmm. Let&#8217;s take the color being &#8220;off&#8221; first and I will get you the others as I move through this a in a bit. Take a look at the image below&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/D7000-color-AP30170.jpg" rel="lightbox">

</a></p>

<p>This color chart which is a default Aperture 3 RAW conversion with no other settings applied showcases a few things. The first bugaboo is what I call the yellow-green crossover issue. Find the patch on the right side of the colorchecker that is clearly yellow (third row from the top and three over). Now look at the patch up and to the left of that. These two patches are soooooo close in hue that they are hard to separate that is because most greens are too yellow in the default conversion. Now the big problem is that if you shift this color to green - the yellows also go green, if you don&#8217;t all your greens look yellow. Big problem and one that is almost impossible to develop a preset that will render all scenes in a reasonable and attractive way. My presets will not deal with this completely for all scenes - you pretty much have to choose - optimal Nikon yellow (which are great) or better greens. Next look at the cyan patch in the top row. Also take note of the diagonal line of blue patches with the most saturated blue ending up at the bottom. Compare them to this next image which is NX2 color (standard picture control)</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/D7000-color-NX20171.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/D7000-color-NX20171.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>Notice how different the blues are. Nikon blues are way more towards purple where Aperture 3&#8217;s are more towards green. Notice how the &#8220;cyan&#8221; patch up at the top is completely different - different hue - different everything. Neither of them are &#8220;correct&#8221; as I compare them to my color targets but here is the deal. If you match the Aperture 3 blues at the bottom other blues that shouldn&#8217;t be that purple go too purple in real world photographs. A good example is the sky. The sky is different hues depending on time of day, different days, time of year. Not just saturation - the actual hue - the color number. If you shift Aperture blues in general towards purple sometimes the sky goes tooo purple if it was in the range of blues that Aperture 3 doesn&#8217;t shift too much. Other times since Aperture 3 has a tendency more towards green it goes cyan if not shifted toward blue. Nikon NX2 doesn&#8217;t do this.The reset of the colors are not a big issue but these should be pretty clear to anyone that is not blind.</p>

<p>Now the rest of the answer&#8230; Default gamma or maybe contrast is a better term for everyone. The Nikon picture control settings have some pretty nice default contrast curves that people seem to like. Aperture 3&#8217;s default gamma is all over the map depending on what Nikon camera you are shooting. For the D7000 it&#8217;s not too horrible but still not as attractive as any of the OOC JPEG&#8217;s So the other aspect to my presets is matching the gamma/contrast curve for all the various Nikon picture controls as closely as possible which unfortunately is not just manipulating the end points of the curve it&#8217;s a bit more complicated.</p>

<p>Now, why is it taking me so long? To be blunt - no one preset is going to match Nikon color and gamma on any given scene. It cannot because of what we are left with after the initial Aperture 3 conversion. I have a work-flow and look that I like and deal with all of my Nikon RAW images individually. That&#8217;s pretty hard to package up in a preset. In fact I am not able to do that nor will I try. Instead I going to include a bunch of variations that should be generally useful starting points for a lot of images.</p>

<p>One set tries to deal with color, contrast, saturation, everything. Are they perfect - no. Especially if there are greens and yellows in the scene or depending on what the color of the sky was on that particular day. I am also providing another set that deals with gamma only - that&#8217;s it, no color adjustment whatsoever. Another set of presets deals with gamma and saturation with no hue shifts. Lastly some variations on dealing with only optimizing a particular set of colors. So, the presets are actually a bunch of presets depending on what would be a useful starting point for you, your work-flow, and your images. That and I have to test them against real world images to see how useful they are. You cannot just check them against this chart and be done with it.</p>

<p>That is one of the reasons I am very curious to see how the new Datacolor color calibrator for Aperture 3 actually works in the real world since it uses the selective color tool that I am using. My guess is it will not be that great. Unfortunately I don&#8217;t want to buy it just to find out how bad it is.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay - so you read my long drawn out bunch of stuff the other day regarding how all of a sudden the Nikon D7000 NEF RAW processing was somehow magically fixed in Aperture 3. Well this is an official retraction of that statement. I was having a very very strange day when I posted that and somehow got a few of my 300 million versions of files that I am working on for the D7000 picture control presets mixed up and re-named.</p>

<p>Long story short - I screwed up. Nothing is fixed in Aperture 3. Same old, same old. That&#8217;s the bad news. The good news is that I don&#8217;t have to completely re-do all of my preset work and stand a good chance on getting version 1 of the D7000 Aperture 3 presets out the door this weekend.</p>

<p>Sorry for the confusion and mis-information, my bad.</p>

<p>Back to work&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Once upon a time somebody complained about how far off Aperture 3&#8217;s NEF processing was. That was me. Actually I complained about it incesantly since Aperture V1. My very very very first post to the Apple Aperture community forum way way back years ago was about how far off Aperture&#8217;s RAW decode was in terms of color from that of Nikon&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Fast forward. I get a brand new Nikon D7000 and no surprise, Aperture 3&#8217;s color is still way off. The blue&#8217;s are too cyan, the greens are too yellow, the yellows are too green, etc, etc. Pretty much the same formula that has been NEF processing in Aperture since the dawn of time. Yes the amount they are off, the degree to which they render in terms of saturation and density are again different but they are still the same general recipe.</p>

<p>The gamma and WB have gotten closer to Nikon&#8217;s with each NEF RAW implementation that Apple has done as new cameras have come down the pipeline but the color was still off. Over the course of a few years I have put some free presets out there for different Nikon camera models that get you closer to an NX2 decode in Aperture but they have not been complete and they were adjusted more or less to my tastes.</p>

<p>This time I decided to get as close as possible to all of the NX2 rendered Nikon Picture Control settings for the D7000. I have been refining them under different lighting conditions and different scenes for the last three weeks. I am on version 4 of my refinements to both the gamma as well as the color. I sat down yesterday to do what would be the final version 5 to be offered to all of you Aperture 3 Nikon shooters that have been living with this and guess what&#8230;</p>

<p>Everything changed. The latest greatest update for Aperture 3 and Apple&#8217;s Camera RAW that came out just a little while ago seemed to have changed everything. WTF? I need more time to investigate this and test it on a few different camera models but for the D7000 the color is as close as it has ever been to the way NX2 decodes NEF RAW files. I swear this is unbelievable. It&#8217;s still a little different but nowhere near the same degree that it used to be. The typical hue shifts that I have seen in the past and even prior to the last update are nowhere near what they were for the D7000.</p>

<p>In any case - I am re-doing the D7000 presets for all the Picture controls but even without them they are not nearly as ugly as they used to be. Of course I will match gamma and saturation as well in the presets. Hopefully they will be done by the end of the week.</p>

<p>Did anyone else notice this? Am I going mad? What the hell??? I will keep you updated as I continue to investigate this surprising turn of events.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As you might have noticed, I have been doing a lot of work with Final Cut Pro X and talking about video. In the past I have not give the time of day to video on my blog. Why all of a sudden all the FCP X and video posts? Well really two reasons. First I actually rather present still photos that are part of some project or story as a video when presenting it on the web or even to a group of people. Second I have some projects coming up where I will need to do quite a bit of this type of work. Third - Some of those projects will actually require me to make actual video footage. I have a bit of experience doing this way way back on both film and video cams as well as a bit of experience with non-linear editing. These requirements were actually a big part of my Nikon D7000 purchase decision. More about the DSLR video decision and why I choose the D7000 soon.</p>

<p>How does this relate to Flash Player? Ummm&#8230; tangentially. One way or another if you produce video for web consumption you it will probably touch Flash Player sooner or later. I hate Flash and cannot wait for it to die a horrible death. Until then unless you want to set up your own streaming infrastructure - you are stuck with your video being played via flash. In messing around with YouTube and Vimeo (both using flash players for the vast majority of people in the universe unless the consumer jumps through hoops NOT to have it use flash) I realized that the current version of Flash was dropping frames like crazy on some test videos - actually all videos played in flash. My machine is a way overconfigured iMac core i7 sandy bridge that takes a lot of effort to make it even break a sweat. So why with nothing going on is Flash dropping 10-20% of the frames in any video? Answer = Flash sucks.</p>

<p>If you happen to be experiencing dropped frames in Flash for no apparent reason here is the recipe that seemed to solve the issue for me on OS X&#8230;</p>

<ol>
    <li>Un-install Flash using the Adobe uninstaller.</li>
    <li>Reset all of the caches, history in Safari.</li>
    <li>Repair permissions using Disk Utility on your boot drive.</li>
    <li>Re-install the latest version of the Flash Player.</li>
</ol>


<p>Early on in OS X 10.6 there were some rumblings that Safari had to be running in 32-bit mode for Flash not to drop frames but in my case today with the latest update to 10.6 this does not seem to be a factor and 64-bit runs fine for me now. Even if you don&#8217;t make video and just watch them - this may help you out if you are seeing dropped frames in YouTube, Vimeo, Hulu, etc&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I have been beating my head in learning the new FCP. I am not doing this just for fun and games. I actually have a couple of projects coming up where I must decide what software to use to put them together. It has been 2 or 3 years since I did anything serious with video that &#8220;counted&#8221;.  I had to make a decision to go down the FCP X road which is brand new. Go down the FCP 7 route which I know has some limited lifetime but could definitely accomplish what I needed to do, or use this as a spring board to something else. Anyway you sliced it it was going to be a fairly big job for me.</p>

<p>After doing dozens of small, StupidCrap™ made up projects and chucking everything at FCP X that I could think I might have to do from a video, audio, key framing, and even some custom Motion 5 stuff. My verdict is that while I believe that FCP X still needs some additional features and fine-tuning, I am going to do my upcoming projects with it. At least the ones that are on my plate right now. I have no need for tape and the multi-cam stuff that I may need is work-around-able in FCP X. As for the software itself - it is very deep - way more than meets the eye. Every single time I spend more than an hour using it I find a new and previously hidden gem. Mark my words - this thing is very slick and if Apple does a couple of things that I expect them to do as slick as the what they have delivered so far this thing will be killer in a year or so.</p>

<p>Most of the built in effects, transitions, and titling are kind of outlandish and not really usable as they stand - I think Apple got those wrong for it&#8217;s intended audience. When I say that I do not mean that they <em>actually intended</em> them for consumption directly by pro level users. I think they intended them to be kind of like over the top look at me demonstrations of what you can do very simply and very re-useable with the $49 Motion 5 add-on. If you are an individual user it&#8217;s a must have, if you are in a shop then someone must have Motion 5 - the titling guy, the transition guy, the effects guy. The point is you can build just about any massively complex and configurable thing you can imagine in Motion 5 and have it show up in a very easy to use way within FCP X - very very very slick. The problem is that I don&#8217;t think a lot of people out there just don&#8217;t &#8220;get it&#8221; and the few that do, don&#8217;t care because a couple of things that they need NOW are deal killers - like tape.</p>

<p>In any case please get the demo and invest some real effort into learning it before you just follow the rest of the echo chamber out there spouting off things that they have no clue about as if they were gospel - like &#8221;
FCP X is missing EVERYTHING&#8221; - If I am right the couple of things that it is &#8220;missing&#8221;  will be dealt with in the relatively near term in one of two ways.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Legacy stuff will be via 3rd party - like tape.</li>
    <li>Non-legacy stuff like work-flow - via Apple and 3rd parties in a very very slick way that will make old work-flows look positively medieval. Like the new roles features in 10.1 - when the new FCP is full fleshed out I think it will be more than a winner - more like a killer of whatever came before it.</li>
</ol>


<p>I know you people are mainly still photographers - so am I - I will get off this video stuff as soon as my actual work starts up. For now I thought a few of you may find this byproduct of my practice sessions with FCP X entertaining. It&#8217;s every single frame I shot of a random photo session a while back cropped 16:9 and time-lapsed into about 2 minutes. Most shots are 2 frames each - some are 6 frames (1/4 second) for pacing and humor, and a few are key-framed for context.</p>

<p>WARNING - R rated (maybe PG-13) so not work-safe.</p>
