  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been a while since I have sung the praises of my itty bitty <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_ss_i_0_13%26field-keywords%3Dpanasonic%2520lx5%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%26sprefix%3Dpanasonic%2520lx5&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Panasonic LX5</a>. Back when I got mine last summer my expectations were well tempered based on my search for a small camera that I could actually love in the past. As you might have noticed more than a few illustrations that I have posted have been shot with the LX5&#8230; Not that they are anything special but they look darn good for a little point and shoot in my opinion.</p>

<p>Take a look at the image shot of a <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/04/10/the-giant-print/">print installation</a> I just finished. That shot was not a particularly careful shot. Just some quick tests of our starting ratios for the lighting and to make sure all the flashes were triggering. I had to shoot at ISO 200 f7.1 and f8 as I set up the flashes for the D700 and tilt-shift 24mm we would be shooting the finals with. Â What is amazing is that this shot was HAND HELD at 1/6 second and came strait out of the camera with a resize on &#8220;16:9 mode&#8221;. That is freaking amazing considering I shot it in typical arms extended live view and caffeine fueled morning mode. Imagine what you can do with this at f2&#8230; I can do this all day and produce sharp images at 1/6-1/8 second. This thing is a low light machine without reaching for stratospheric ISO&#8217;s I almost never shoot above 200 ISO and 400 still looks really really good. You gotta get one of these things - amazing.</p>

<p>Back on point - as most of you know I almost always shoot RAW+JPEG - storage space is cheap and getting cheaper all the time. Why not. Since day one with this camera I have loaded those RAW+JPEG pairs into Aperture 3 without the ability to process the RAW files up until one of the last camera RAW updates from Apple. Yea I know that happened a while ago - I&#8217;ve been busy. So now that Aperture 3 can process the RAW files for this thing I thought I would offer a couple of my notes on the subject.</p>

<ul>
    <li>If you have LX5 RW2 RAW files loaded into Aperture prior to RAW support for them you must must must select them all and &#8220;reprocess the masters&#8221; in order to have Aperture recognize them. This actually goes for all RAW files that you load into Aperture prior to Apple supporting the format. Just thought I would point that out since it came up in a one-on-one session I had a while back.</li>
    <li>I would rate the RAW processing in Aperture 3 for the LX5 as above average. I will post a quick comparison to SilkyPix soon as that would be considered the &#8220;gold standard&#8221; for Panasonic RW2 files along with a sample from LR3/ACR. I guess one of the reasons I was drawn to the LX5 is that the images have similar properties to Nikon produced JPEG files. As you might expect Aperture renders LX5 RAW files differently than the JPEG&#8217;s produced by the camera. Most notably the blues need more luminance and a shift toward purple to match the JPEG - JUST LIKE NIKON NEF files in Aperture 3.</li>
    <li>Aperture 3 noise reduction control is useless. We all know this and if you are adverse to any image noise you will absolutely need a third party plug in for high ISO LX5 RAW files. Me&#8230; I don&#8217;t care most of my shots are 400 ISO and below and the noise doesn&#8217;t show up in the print. For the odd shot at 1600 It doesn&#8217;t really bother me all that much - they aren&#8217;t supposed to look crisp and clean and bright and sunny in my way of thinking. Bottom line is that LR3&#8217;s new noise reduction is amazingly effective on the LX5 RAW files - Aperture 3 not so much.</li>
    <li>Distortion correction&#8230; I have spent no time figuring out or researching if and how any lens distortions are corrected on the LX5 but I have made assumptions that some sort of distortion correction happens in the camera firmware considering how great the lens looks at all focusing distances at the 24mm wide setting. There is a tiny bit of pin-cushion but not much compared to other wide angles. In any case pin-cushion looks way better than barrel distortion for wide angles. For the most part strait likes are pretty darn strait. Guess what - the RAW files are identical processed in Aperture 3. My guess is that any distortion correction etc happens in the camera to the RAW files as well. Same probably goes for CA based on how good the files look and how closely these lens defects appear (or don&#8217;t appear) in both the RAW and JPEGs. Hooray for Venus FHD or whatever it&#8217;s called. Check it yourself - top image is JPEG bottom is Aperture 3 processed. These were shot at the widest setting very close up.</li>
</ul>


<p>[image title=&#8221;P1010372&#8221; size=&#8221;large&#8221; id=&#8221;2936&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;P1010372 - Version 2&#8221; size=&#8221;large&#8221; id=&#8221;2934&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<ul>
    <li>The LX5 has an interesting aspect ratio control that allows you to shoot square, 4:3, 3:2, and 16:9. These aspect ratios show up in the RAW file as well. Very cool. The biggest reason this is cool is these are not merely crops from the &#8220;native 4:3&#8221; sensor. They actually seem to preserve the angle of view - well at least they do in anything &#8220;skinnier than 4:3&#8221;. The square aspect ratio is identical to making a crop of the 4:3 in post production. The first image below is a camera produced 16:9 vs a crop from the 4:3 - subtle but significant. You get more pixels and a wider view from the in camera produced 16:9.</li>
</ul>


<p>[image title=&#8221;P1010375&#8221; size=&#8221;large&#8221; id=&#8221;2938&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;P1010373 - Version 5&#8221; size=&#8221;large&#8221; id=&#8221;2937&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<ul>
    <li>The LX5 has much more aggressive sharpening on every JPEG mode than Aperture 3 does on the RAW. There is also a local contrast enhancement that occurs on JPEG files if you are using the LX5&#8217;s &#8220;intelligent resolution&#8221; setting. The closest thing to this in terms of an Aperture 3 adjustment is the definition control combined with edge sharpen. Without this the JPEG&#8217;s look far and away better than the default RAW conversion. Here is a sample RAW on the left JPEG on the right.</li>
</ul>


<p>[image title=&#8221;screenshot&#8221; size=&#8221;large&#8221; id=&#8221;2942&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<ul>
    <li>Of course you can add that with definition and edge sharpen like so&#8230;</li>
</ul>


<p>[image title=&#8221;screenshot2&#8221; size=&#8221;large&#8221; id=&#8221;2943&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>There are a couple of things I would like to change on the LX5 but none of them are a deal killer. Believe it or not the biggest thing is that there seems to be no way to turn off the &#8220;pre-flash&#8221; metering pulse from the built in flash. This makes it useless as a trigger for off-camera flash as the slaved units will trigger too soon. The other thing that is very closely related is the ability to manually dial down the flash from full to 1/128 power vs the 2 stops of compensation provided from &#8220;automatic&#8221;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wanted to pass on something about the behavior of Aperture 3 stacks that all of you may not be aware of. If you have been taking advantage of Aperture&#8217;s albums and album-pick features for organizing your images (the key to good work-flow and organization) you can take advantage of a subtlety in the behavior of stacks when you need to delete all of the versions that happen to show up as an album pick in any particular album.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s assume we are starting out with an album that happens to have duplicate versions as album-picks of some images with a set of adjustments applied like this&#8230;</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;sc3&#8221; size=&#8221;large&#8221; id=&#8221;2928&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>In this album all of the image stacks are closed, In most cases this is when stacks are most useful as they are only showing you images at the top of the stack for a particular album. As you can see I have selected all of the images with command-A. If I were to delete all the versions using either the context menu or command-delete every single image version in the stack would go away. This behavior is different that most other things in Aperture like &#8220;duplicate version&#8221; or &#8220;new version from master&#8221;, etc, etc. In these cases Aperture 3 assumes that I only want to affect the versions that are showing at the top of the stack. With delete version Aperture 3 assumes that I want everything to go away.</p>

<p>What happens if I only want the versions at the top of the stack to go away??? Simple enough just open all the stacks via the stack menu or better yet use option-single-quote instead, like this&#8230;</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;sc4&#8221; size=&#8221;large&#8221; id=&#8221;2929&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>Now with all of the stacks open you can see that only the album-picks are selected. If you delete-versions now using the context menu or command-delete only the album-picks will be deleted. Like so&#8230;</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;sc5&#8221; size=&#8221;large&#8221; id=&#8221;2930&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>I know this seems a little esoteric to be of much use but it is an important and subtle behavior that not only should all Aperture users be aware of but it actually serves as an illustration as to the power of stacks and album picks when used to their full advantage. The whole point of Aperture&#8217;s stacks/albums/album-picks along with the selection behavior and search tools is to wire them together in ways that suit your own work-flow needs. You will find that once you get used to creating albums with specific album picks for various steps in your work-flow that they can help speed things along quite nicely. I pretty much create a new album for just about every selection I have ever made for any reason. That way I never have to make that selection again or remember what images I did what with and for what reason.</p>

<p>One last thing that I should mention is that it is imperative to set the Aperture preference &#8220;Automatically stack new versions&#8221; for albums and album-picks to be efficiently used. If you are not comfortable with Aperture 3&#8217;s image stacks yet you may want to <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/aperture-ebooks/">check out my e-books&#8230; Specifically the Organization e-book.</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the most part I am a people shooter. I am about as interested in shooting images of static things that don&#8217;t interact with me as I am in watching the proverbial grass grow. Today my buddy <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/">Les Picker</a> enlisted my assistance in shooting some location/interior shots of his latest installation of wall art in a new restaurant prior to them firing up lunch service.</p>

<p>We are going back tomorrow but I did want to post a short blurb on setting up shots for something like this. I am not going to go into any details as Les will probably be posting some detail later from his perspective and I only took a few shots with my trusty LX5 to get some initial ratios as a starting point for our endeavors.</p>

<p>Here is my starting point from guess work - quite literally my second shot and the point at which we transitioned to a tripod mounted D700 with 24 tilt-shift Nikkor for the real deal.</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;P1010202&#8221; size=&#8221;large&#8221; id=&#8221;2918&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>Our starting point consisted of one light in the room behind the glass that reads Carsins&#8217;. It was pretty much in a bare-bulb configuration sans reflector that we ultimately re-engineered to reduce the brightness in the doorway and make the gradient on the window frosting more controllable Â  by putting a 10&#8221; narrow beam reflector on the light and shooting that into a 48 inch white disk across the room. We had very little location flexibility with that light because we were short one radio slave and it had to be optically triggered.</p>

<p>We also fine tuned the ambient ratio a bit by about a third of a stop more than what you see in the above illustration. The ambient was a strange mix of incandescent, quartz, and cloudy daylight coming through large windows to camera rear. I decieded to shoot at a daylight WB with and leave the flash unfiltered as the ambient mix at daylight complemented the warmth of the walls and cherry floor. Other colors would work better in reverse - namely shooting so that ambient was neutral and then filtering the lights to produce the color temperature that was pleasing (typically a little bit warmer than the shadows for my tastes).</p>

<p>There were two other lights - one you can see a hole in the reflector on the right of the frame. This was a 7 inch reflector with a 30 degree grid spot focused on the large 6x9 foot mural on the back wall. the other was on camera left with a 40 degree grid. Ultimately we went with a much tighter 20 degree grid on that light. to make the falloff around the image array on the left wall far more apparent.</p>

<p>We shot everything manual with pocket wizard radio slaves as we were using my thermonuclear powered big-boy lights *4800 ws&#8217; vs those puny battery powered overpriced plastic things Nikon and Canon sell. Even if we did choose to use 3 dozen SB-800&#8217;s shooting manual in this kind of set up is far far far easier and more consistent thanÂ Â wrestling with trying to outsmart the computer on your camera every shot with TTL.</p>

<p>We are going back tomorrow to finish the job and filling in some of the shots with people at the tables and walking through the scene with some motion blur, etc. etc. It&#8217;s always good to have your shots figured out and all the lighting figured out prior to introducing live moving people to direct into the equation. For the static people I will probably add a 22&#8221; dish with a giant grid spot to light them in the foreground at about the same ratio as the images or maybe a little under. Stay tuned. In all seriousness if the details of this kind of thing are up your alley feel free to shoot any questions my way.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/">Keep an eye out on Les&#8217; site</a> as I am sure he will be posting all the gory detail soon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have had a hell of a week - or maybe it was the week from hell. At this point I don&#8217;t even know I just know that for about a week there has been some sort of hell. Anyway&#8230; you don&#8217;t think that I can see something like #onedaywithjeshinstead and not comment.</p>

<p>Okay here is the story. I happened to be looking at the 4 or 5 folks that I follow on twitter and saw the Zack Arias tweet that started this whole think off - I had no freaking idea what ZA was talking about, I don&#8217;t really know ZA, I have never met him. I do know he is seems like an okay person/photographer with a reasonable approach to things. Someone that I am probably closer to in wavelength then the target of his contempt - namely jesh someone or other. So I looked up the jesh dude and laughed my ass off. I know that there were a bunch of yo-yo&#8217;s jumping in to defend jesh.</p>

<p>I do have to use the term yo-yo because anybody defending this guy falls into the same category as jesh in my little search tree of a brain. Actually it&#8217;s more of a directed graph than a tree. In any case the leaf nodes end up in only a couple of spots with the root being yo-yo if I make the very positive assumption that he is not a total predatory asshole deserving some horrible fate. In other words let&#8217;s believe that he buys in to his own bullshit - for me that is a positive thought process - this automatically puts you in the good category vs the evil category even if I don&#8217;t gravitate to all the love-y dove-y goo-y foo-y artsy fartsy stuff. So the defenders either do buy into all of that soft fluffy poo-poo OR they buy into everything is good and we should criticize anything, everybody wins fluffy poo-poo. Both sorts of fluffy poo purveying types fall under the yo-yo node of my tree.</p>

<p>Just to get you up to speed here are the bullet points.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Jesh dude sells some sort of education crap that is sort of power of positive love and burn some incense type thing - obviously not my school of thought so you know where I would land on this.</li>
    <li>He does some webinar thing where he offers a &#8220;discount&#8221; fee for a one day one on one workshop with him to smoke some pot, burn some incense, and get in touch with your true inner lovefest path to making decent pictures at the low low price of&#8230; hold on to your chairs for this&#8230; $16,500.</li>
    <li>Zack calls bullshit on this.</li>
    <li>Twitter and the photo community goes bananas between the tree hugging why can&#8217;t we all just get along crowd (not a tolerant bunch if you actually have an opinion) and the ha-ha-ha WTF more tangible value oriented crowd.</li>
    <li>Funny stuff.</li>
</ul>


<p>Just thought all of you backwards enough to read my little backwoods blog photo people would like a somewhat belated recap of what you probably missed in the more web 2.4 social media photography connected cloud photographer community.</p>

<p>Oh, I have to raise my one on one rates or I will lose all self respect - right now I priced it at exactly the cost of my smoking habit and beverage of choice for a similar time period rate.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/01/27/large-prints-and-other-ephemera/">Remember that giant print I told you about a few weeks ago</a>. You know the one that is a 6 x 9. As in 6 FEET by 9 FEET. We received it the other day and installed it at the restaurant. I think it turned out pretty darn good. I took a couple quick snaps of the final product on my LX5.</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;P1010185&#8221; size=&#8221;large&#8221; id=&#8221;2910&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>A little background - as all of you may know, big print = expensive print no matter how you slice it. Based on the overall budget Â and a few other durability requirements, etc. We decided on a surface mounted inkjet print with a plastic coating that can be washed. It also had to be shipped. The widest size that can be produced by this particular service provider is 48 inches. All things considered I decided to print the single image in sections 3 feet wide each. Based on the edge finishing of the product you cannot really count on it being pixel perfect at the edge so&#8230; this is how we decided to display it mounted. Would love to hear your thoughts. If anyone cares, I can walk you through some of the techniques that I used to blow a 12 megapixel image up to 6 x 9 feet that holds up well at close viewing distances.</p>

<p>Here is a shot of another section of the installation - altogether there are like 25 images or something that we installed. These are 20x30 prints.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This morning our buddy <a href="http://www.mconnorsphotos.com/blog/after-the-picture/">Matthew Connors posted some thoughts on post processing</a>. I wanted to cross post my response here as sort of a book mark for some future thoughts and discussion down the road when I have a bit time to gather my words on this subject. Please take this as food for thought not an absolute as it is in no way meant to be. Take this in the context of a contrast between photojournalism, documentary, and personal images made by ANYONE using film just a short time ago vs today.</p>

<p>When I was making commercial images on film the full array of &#8220;effect&#8221; was not only possible but widely practiced - usually not directly by the photographer but in collaboration with the photographer. For my personal images, art images, documentary images, etc. It never never crossed my mind to run those images through the eye popping &#8220;effect of the day&#8221; in post be it analog or digital. At the end of the day why the hell would you - what is the purpose? Does every image have to be some sort of &#8220;LOOK AT ME&#8221; advertisement for something? You do realize that IS the purpose of effect, don&#8217;t you?</p>

<p>My response to Matt is <a href="http://www.mconnorsphotos.com/blog/after-the-picture/">in the comments</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a quick update. Back to the original plan at the urging of Charles. So I went through all the entries, put them in a big pot (metaphorically speaking), and selected the winner at random.</p>

<p>And the winner is&#8230;</p>

<p>Gabriel Ponzinelli his website is <a href="http://www.gabrielponzanelli.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>I have written to Gabriel to confirm a shipping address and assuming he is still interested and alive, the F3 is his. If for some reason I cannot make contact I sill have the pot of entries and will make another selection next week.</p>

<p>So&#8230; What should I give away next?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know this is short notice but an entry just came in for the <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/02/06/nikon-f3-give-away/comment-page-2/#comment-23865">Nikon F3 giveaway</a> that merits my consideration to modify the contest and just declare this person the winner. I did want to put this post out before I decided to see what all of you that follow this blog thought. In no way do I want to disrespect or neglect the people that entered the contest or get anyone upset that is following the contest &#8220;just to see what happens&#8221;.</p>

<p>Here is the deal - A photographer from Japan that regularly shoots film submitted a last minute entry via his PHONE due to no access to the internet from the earthquake. He already has a lens for the camera but no body. As long as I can get a way to get the camera to him I would love to just declare him the winner but need some input here on everyone&#8217;s thoughts.</p>

<p>If anyone is really upset that I might do this please speak up and let me know your thoughts - Don&#8217;t worry I will hold another contest I promise. I just need to reorganize it and make sure I have a camera that is in good shape but no time commitment right this second - too much on my mind.</p>

<p>PLEASE COMMENT AND LAT ME KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yes, I am distracted with film. Which in turn focuses me on making pictures instead of figuring out what digital crap I &#8220;need&#8221; next. When it comes to gear lust a quick hundred bucks or so usually satisfies the need via flea-bay. Check out the Awesome lens I snagged for TWENTY bucks. Yep - that&#8217;s like a couple cups of coffee.</p>

<p>[image title=&#8221;Nikkor135mm_720&#8221; size=&#8221;medium&#8221; id=&#8221;2888&#8221; align=&#8221;none&#8221; linkto=&#8221;viewer&#8221; ]</p>

<p>Of course gear lust is constantly quenched via the deliveries of film - a very nice tactical sensation that is absolutely a requirement of making images. The upside to this is I feel no compulsion to continue to search for the &#8220;perfect&#8221; digital camera. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WJR69E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003WJR69E">I have my LX5</a> - I am happy with that for quickie shots. I have a HUGE array of film equipment that dates from the 1930&#8217;s to the pinnacle of film tech. All of it is a dream in terms of refinement of function and focus on making an image vs. fiddling around with far far too many controls that have nothing to do with the matter at hand. The viewfinders alone blow the crap out of anything digital.</p>

<p>If I were not this distracted with my film stuff I would definitely be buying the Fuji X100 ASAP. Just so I can discover all the things I don&#8217;t like about it compared to my Leica M film cameras. At least for the time being I am perfectly content. Speaking of the Fuji, based on all the initial hub-bub I would definitely be getting one if I weren&#8217;t temporarily off the digital gear treadmill. I does look to be a very pleasant device to use. At least in digital world.</p>

<p>Speaking of <a href="http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/11/antarctica-in-black-and-very-white/">cool film images check these out from the 1950&#8217;s</a> - amazing, simple, beautiful, interesting, no tricks, just strait up photography.</p>

<p>For something a little more modern <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mattbell/4389038026/">check this guy I met up with that is a youngster that shoots nothing but film in 35mm and 120</a> - seriously nice work.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/02/06/nikon-f3-give-away/">Only 5 more days until there is a lucky winner of the Nikon F3</a>. I sure hope the winner will be gracious enough to share some images with us.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have received more than one email that in one way or another asked about the state of my mental health. Some of them not so nice. Of course these were related to the use of the F word. No the other four letter F word - FILM. I could write about digital shit all day and night 24x7 and suggest every piece of equipment and software known to mankind. I could probably contradict my recommendations 24 hours later and nobody would ever question it.</p>

<p>I mention film and old cheap fantastic equipment that can be had for a song - I get emails telling me I am off my rocker and how EVERYONE knows how badly film is beat about the head by just about any digital camera. Hmmmm ummmmm, welllll. Uh let&#8217;s see.</p>

<p>If you have the budget the choice is almost always film in the world of visual quality, easy of capture, consistency, lighting options, overall look, etc. As long as cost is no object and it doesn&#8217;t need to be put on the web in the next 5 minutes film is the capture medium of Â choice. Yep even in 2011.</p>

<p>Of course the ONLY place in the visual world that cost hasn&#8217;t been totally self-destructed is in motion. For the most part still photographs are a bust - NOBODY is willing to pay for quality, well generally not many people. Most people don&#8217;t care. They didn&#8217;t care when it was film - hence 110, fixed focus cameras, box cameras, etc. Consumers drive the vast majority of the imaging market. You think Vince LaForet who does the whole video on the DSLR thing is at the high end of the market? Wrong he is a still photographer that saw a way out - look at the equipment he is gravitating to. DSLR? Nope - if he didn&#8217;t make a lot of money showing you guys &#8220;how-to&#8221; with your DSLR and if you actually got a couple of drinks in him he would probably tell you he would LOVE to shoot 35mm film in the big pond with the big fishies.</p>

<p>Now once you have the production crew, and the booms, dollies, train tracks, cranes, lighting - now you are talking big budget. That&#8217;s how you make things look good, have a big production - big crew - big money - you shoot film. Heck they even use film for a lot of high-end commercials - mostly 16mm scanned to HD but in some cases 35mm as well.</p>

<p>Wanna see some? Take a look at the Under Armor commercials of late - I thought they looked fantastic and the lighting was pretty amazing and pretty &#8220;not-digital&#8221; looking to me, so I looked it up. What do you know - A roll on 35mm Vision3 Kodak B roll all hand held on 16mm Kodak Vision3. Most of the visual effects were even done in-camera like the speed changes and exposure changes. If you can&#8217;t tell the difference here you could probably live with your iPhone for the rest of your life and be happy - just sharpen and crank the local contrast and saturation - that should make it nice and LOUD but unfortunately not luscious like film does with light that nails the look right out of the can. 7 stops exposure latitude? Nice flexibility to boot.</p>
