  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the most part I am a people shooter. I am about as interested in shooting images of static things that don&#8217;t interact with me as I am in watching the proverbial grass grow. Today my buddy <a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/">Les Picker</a> enlisted my assistance in shooting some location/interior shots of his latest installation of wall art in a new restaurant prior to them firing up lunch service.</p>

<p>We are going back tomorrow but I did want to post a short blurb on setting up shots for something like this. I am not going to go into any details as Les will probably be posting some detail later from his perspective and I only took a few shots with my trusty LX5 to get some initial ratios as a starting point for our endeavors.</p>

<p>Here is my starting point from guess work - quite literally my second shot and the point at which we transitioned to a tripod mounted D700 with 24 tilt-shift Nikkor for the real deal.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1010202.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/P1010202.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>Our starting point consisted of one light in the room behind the glass that reads Carsins&#8217;. It was pretty much in a bare-bulb configuration sans reflector that we ultimately re-engineered to reduce the brightness in the doorway and make the gradient on the window frosting more controllable   by putting a 10&#8221; narrow beam reflector on the light and shooting that into a 48 inch white disk across the room. We had very little location flexibility with that light because we were short one radio slave and it had to be optically triggered.</p>

<p>We also fine tuned the ambient ratio a bit by about a third of a stop more than what you see in the above illustration. The ambient was a strange mix of incandescent, quartz, and cloudy daylight coming through large windows to camera rear. I decieded to shoot at a daylight WB with and leave the flash unfiltered as the ambient mix at daylight complemented the warmth of the walls and cherry floor. Other colors would work better in reverse - namely shooting so that ambient was neutral and then filtering the lights to produce the color temperature that was pleasing (typically a little bit warmer than the shadows for my tastes).</p>

<p>There were two other lights - one you can see a hole in the reflector on the right of the frame. This was a 7 inch reflector with a 30 degree grid spot focused on the large 6x9 foot mural on the back wall. the other was on camera left with a 40 degree grid. Ultimately we went with a much tighter 20 degree grid on that light. to make the falloff around the image array on the left wall far more apparent.</p>

<p>We shot everything manual with pocket wizard radio slaves as we were using my thermonuclear powered big-boy lights *4800 ws&#8217; vs those puny battery powered overpriced plastic things Nikon and Canon sell. Even if we did choose to use 3 dozen SB-800&#8217;s shooting manual in this kind of set up is far far far easier and more consistent than  wrestling with trying to outsmart the computer on your camera every shot with TTL.</p>

<p>We are going back tomorrow to finish the job and filling in some of the shots with people at the tables and walking through the scene with some motion blur, etc. etc. It&#8217;s always good to have your shots figured out and all the lighting figured out prior to introducing live moving people to direct into the equation. For the static people I will probably add a 22&#8221; dish with a giant grid spot to light them in the foreground at about the same ratio as the images or maybe a little under. Stay tuned. In all seriousness if the details of this kind of thing are up your alley feel free to shoot any questions my way.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lesterpickerphoto.com/">Keep an eye out on Les&#8217; site</a> as I am sure he will be posting all the gory detail soon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have had a hell of a week - or maybe it was the week from hell. At this point I don&#8217;t even know I just know that for about a week there has been some sort of hell. Anyway&#8230; you don&#8217;t think that I can see something like #onedaywithjeshinstead and not comment.</p>

<p>Okay here is the story. I happened to be looking at the 4 or 5 folks that I follow on twitter and saw the Zack Arias tweet that started this whole think off - I had no freaking idea what ZA was talking about, I don&#8217;t really know ZA, I have never met him. I do know he is seems like an okay person/photographer with a reasonable approach to things. Someone that I am probably closer to in wavelength then the target of his contempt - namely jesh someone or other. So I looked up the jesh dude and laughed my ass off. I know that there were a bunch of yo-yo&#8217;s jumping in to defend jesh.</p>

<p>I do have to use the term yo-yo because anybody defending this guy falls into the same category as jesh in my little search tree of a brain. Actually it&#8217;s more of a directed graph than a tree. In any case the leaf nodes end up in only a couple of spots with the root being yo-yo if I make the very positive assumption that he is not a total predatory asshole deserving some horrible fate. In other words let&#8217;s believe that he buys in to his own bullshit - for me that is a positive thought process - this automatically puts you in the good category vs the evil category even if I don&#8217;t gravitate to all the love-y dove-y goo-y foo-y artsy fartsy stuff. So the defenders either do buy into all of that soft fluffy poo-poo OR they buy into everything is good and we should criticize anything, everybody wins fluffy poo-poo. Both sorts of fluffy poo purveying types fall under the yo-yo node of my tree.</p>

<p>Just to get you up to speed here are the bullet points.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Jesh dude sells some sort of education crap that is sort of power of positive love and burn some incense type thing - obviously not my school of thought so you know where I would land on this.</li>
    <li>He does some webinar thing where he offers a &#8220;discount&#8221; fee for a one day one on one workshop with him to smoke some pot, burn some incense, and get in touch with your true inner lovefest path to making decent pictures at the low low price of&#8230; hold on to your chairs for this&#8230; $16,500.</li>
    <li>Zack calls bullshit on this.</li>
    <li>Twitter and the photo community goes bananas between the tree hugging why can&#8217;t we all just get along crowd (not a tolerant bunch if you actually have an opinion) and the ha-ha-ha WTF more tangible value oriented crowd.</li>
    <li>Funny stuff.</li>
</ul>


<p>Just thought all of you backwards enough to read my little backwoods blog photo people would like a somewhat belated recap of what you probably missed in the more web 2.4 social media photography connected cloud photographer community.</p>

<p>Oh, I have to raise my one on one rates or I will lose all self respect - right now I priced it at exactly the cost of my smoking habit and beverage of choice for a similar time period rate.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/01/27/large-prints-and-other-ephemera/">Remember that giant print I told you about a few weeks ago</a>. You know the one that is a 6 x 9. As in 6 FEET by 9 FEET. We received it the other day and installed it at the restaurant. I think it turned out pretty darn good. I took a couple quick snaps of the final product on my LX5.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1010185.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1010185.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>A little background - as all of you may know, big print = expensive print no matter how you slice it. Based on the overall budget  and a few other durability requirements, etc. We decided on a surface mounted inkjet print with a plastic coating that can be washed. It also had to be shipped. The widest size that can be produced by this particular service provider is 48 inches. All things considered I decided to print the single image in sections 3 feet wide each. Based on the edge finishing of the product you cannot really count on it being pixel perfect at the edge so&#8230; this is how we decided to display it mounted. Would love to hear your thoughts. If anyone cares, I can walk you through some of the techniques that I used to blow a 12 megapixel image up to 6 x 9 feet that holds up well at close viewing distances.</p>

<p>Here is a shot of another section of the installation - altogether there are like 25 images or something that we installed. These are 20x30 prints.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This morning our buddy <a href="http://www.mconnorsphotos.com/blog/after-the-picture/">Matthew Connors posted some thoughts on post processing</a>. I wanted to cross post my response here as sort of a book mark for some future thoughts and discussion down the road when I have a bit time to gather my words on this subject. Please take this as food for thought not an absolute as it is in no way meant to be. Take this in the context of a contrast between photojournalism, documentary, and personal images made by ANYONE using film just a short time ago vs today.</p>

<p>When I was making commercial images on film the full array of &#8220;effect&#8221; was not only possible but widely practiced - usually not directly by the photographer but in collaboration with the photographer. For my personal images, art images, documentary images, etc. It never never crossed my mind to run those images through the eye popping &#8220;effect of the day&#8221; in post be it analog or digital. At the end of the day why the hell would you - what is the purpose? Does every image have to be some sort of &#8220;LOOK AT ME&#8221; advertisement for something? You do realize that IS the purpose of effect, don&#8217;t you?</p>

<p>My response to Matt is <a href="http://www.mconnorsphotos.com/blog/after-the-picture/">in the comments</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a quick update. Back to the original plan at the urging of Charles. So I went through all the entries, put them in a big pot (metaphorically speaking), and selected the winner at random.</p>

<p>And the winner is&#8230;</p>

<p>Gabriel Ponzinelli his website is <a href="http://www.gabrielponzanelli.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>I have written to Gabriel to confirm a shipping address and assuming he is still interested and alive, the F3 is his. If for some reason I cannot make contact I sill have the pot of entries and will make another selection next week.</p>

<p>So&#8230; What should I give away next?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know this is short notice but an entry just came in for the <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/02/06/nikon-f3-give-away/comment-page-2/#comment-23865">Nikon F3 giveaway</a> that merits my consideration to modify the contest and just declare this person the winner. I did want to put this post out before I decided to see what all of you that follow this blog thought. In no way do I want to disrespect or neglect the people that entered the contest or get anyone upset that is following the contest &#8220;just to see what happens&#8221;.</p>

<p>Here is the deal - A photographer from Japan that regularly shoots film submitted a last minute entry via his PHONE due to no access to the internet from the earthquake. He already has a lens for the camera but no body. As long as I can get a way to get the camera to him I would love to just declare him the winner but need some input here on everyone&#8217;s thoughts.</p>

<p>If anyone is really upset that I might do this please speak up and let me know your thoughts - Don&#8217;t worry I will hold another contest I promise. I just need to reorganize it and make sure I have a camera that is in good shape but no time commitment right this second - too much on my mind.</p>

<p>PLEASE COMMENT AND LAT ME KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yes, I am distracted with film. Which in turn focuses me on making pictures instead of figuring out what digital crap I &#8220;need&#8221; next. When it comes to gear lust a quick hundred bucks or so usually satisfies the need via flea-bay. Check out the Awesome lens I snagged for TWENTY bucks. Yep - that&#8217;s like a couple cups of coffee.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Nikkor135mm_720.jpg" rel="lightbox">
<img src="http://photo.rwboyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Nikkor135mm_720.jpg">
</a></p>

<p>Of course gear lust is constantly quenched via the deliveries of film - a very nice tactical sensation that is absolutely a requirement of making images. The upside to this is I feel no compulsion to continue to search for the &#8220;perfect&#8221; digital camera. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WJR69E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=rbde-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003WJR69E">I have my LX5</a> - I am happy with that for quickie shots. I have a HUGE array of film equipment that dates from the 1930&#8217;s to the pinnacle of film tech. All of it is a dream in terms of refinement of function and focus on making an image vs. fiddling around with far far too many controls that have nothing to do with the matter at hand. The viewfinders alone blow the crap out of anything digital.</p>

<p>If I were not this distracted with my film stuff I would definitely be buying the Fuji X100 ASAP. Just so I can discover all the things I don&#8217;t like about it compared to my Leica M film cameras. At least for the time being I am perfectly content. Speaking of the Fuji, based on all the initial hub-bub I would definitely be getting one if I weren&#8217;t temporarily off the digital gear treadmill. I does look to be a very pleasant device to use. At least in digital world.</p>

<p>Speaking of <a href="http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/11/antarctica-in-black-and-very-white/">cool film images check these out from the 1950&#8217;s</a> - amazing, simple, beautiful, interesting, no tricks, just strait up photography.</p>

<p>For something a little more modern <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mattbell/4389038026/">check this guy I met up with that is a youngster that shoots nothing but film in 35mm and 120</a> - seriously nice work.</p>

<p><a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/02/06/nikon-f3-give-away/">Only 5 more days until there is a lucky winner of the Nikon F3</a>. I sure hope the winner will be gracious enough to share some images with us.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have received more than one email that in one way or another asked about the state of my mental health. Some of them not so nice. Of course these were related to the use of the F word. No the other four letter F word - FILM. I could write about digital shit all day and night 24x7 and suggest every piece of equipment and software known to mankind. I could probably contradict my recommendations 24 hours later and nobody would ever question it.</p>

<p>I mention film and old cheap fantastic equipment that can be had for a song - I get emails telling me I am off my rocker and how EVERYONE knows how badly film is beat about the head by just about any digital camera. Hmmmm ummmmm, welllll. Uh let&#8217;s see.</p>

<p>If you have the budget the choice is almost always film in the world of visual quality, easy of capture, consistency, lighting options, overall look, etc. As long as cost is no object and it doesn&#8217;t need to be put on the web in the next 5 minutes film is the capture medium of  choice. Yep even in 2011.</p>

<p>Of course the ONLY place in the visual world that cost hasn&#8217;t been totally self-destructed is in motion. For the most part still photographs are a bust - NOBODY is willing to pay for quality, well generally not many people. Most people don&#8217;t care. They didn&#8217;t care when it was film - hence 110, fixed focus cameras, box cameras, etc. Consumers drive the vast majority of the imaging market. You think Vince LaForet who does the whole video on the DSLR thing is at the high end of the market? Wrong he is a still photographer that saw a way out - look at the equipment he is gravitating to. DSLR? Nope - if he didn&#8217;t make a lot of money showing you guys &#8220;how-to&#8221; with your DSLR and if you actually got a couple of drinks in him he would probably tell you he would LOVE to shoot 35mm film in the big pond with the big fishies.</p>

<p>Now once you have the production crew, and the booms, dollies, train tracks, cranes, lighting - now you are talking big budget. That&#8217;s how you make things look good, have a big production - big crew - big money - you shoot film. Heck they even use film for a lot of high-end commercials - mostly 16mm scanned to HD but in some cases 35mm as well.</p>

<p>Wanna see some? Take a look at the Under Armor commercials of late - I thought they looked fantastic and the lighting was pretty amazing and pretty &#8220;not-digital&#8221; looking to me, so I looked it up. What do you know - A roll on 35mm Vision3 Kodak B roll all hand held on 16mm Kodak Vision3. Most of the visual effects were even done in-camera like the speed changes and exposure changes. If you can&#8217;t tell the difference here you could probably live with your iPhone for the rest of your life and be happy - just sharpen and crank the local contrast and saturation - that should make it nice and LOUD but unfortunately not luscious like film does with light that nails the look right out of the can. 7 stops exposure latitude? Nice flexibility to boot.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been a little sparse lately but I&#8217;m still alive. Just wanted to take a few seconds to update all of you on a few topics near and dear. First off - The Nikon F3 give-away is about a week away and on track. I finally have selected which of my Nikon F3&#8217;s will be sent out to a somewhat lucky photographer that posted a comment on <a href="http://photo.rwboyer.com/2011/02/06/nikon-f3-give-away/">the give-away thread</a>. As mentioned I was going to select one that I don&#8217;t use but no too too pretty. I have landed on one that is free of major cosmetic damage (not that it matters much to the function), has an HP finder so it&#8217;s not too ancient, and appears to have NO impairments or quirks in function at all.</p>

<p>The only &#8220;issue&#8221; with it is that like so so many F3&#8217;s it&#8217;s missing screw-in plain glass eye piece on the back of the finder. This is not really something functional but the winner will probably want to grab one on eBay just to make it perfect. Little known fact&#8230; I believe ANY round finder Nikon eye piece made after the F3 HP will work fine so don&#8217;t get hung up on getting one for &#8220;the F3HP&#8221;. The old DE-2 F3 finder eye piece will NOT work. Heck buy a used N8008 or something like 5 bucks - maybe cheaper. Keep your eye&#8217;s peeled - end of next week we will have a winner. What should I giveaway next?</p>

<p>Another update - remember that GIANT print I was helping to make? Well it&#8217;s done and looks fantastic - it&#8217;s somewhere over 5 FEET x 8 FEET - the photographer and I decided to go the cheap route and make the image into a triptych that is 3 pieces and it turned out great. We install it into the restaurant sometime before the end of March - I will give you guys an image of what the install looks like and details on what we used to do it if you are interested.</p>

<p>One other note&#8230; Somehow in the middle of my annual winter depression, I am getting inspired to do a bit more real photography crap in 2011. Part of that may be some actual scheduled workshops. I am kinda not real fond of doing what I have done in the past - namely focusing on just studio lighting, nor just people, nor just technical stuff, nor just work-flow. I am kinda thinking of doing something end to end that might encompass a mini-project that combines shooting the subject AND the post work-flow rather than just one or the other. Any thoughts? Oh and it will involve shooting some sort of people NOT landscape/still life etc as I find that mind-numbing and tooooo dependent on weather conditions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>No doubt about it, we humans tend to become &#8220;conditioned&#8221;, &#8220;trained&#8221;, and downright programmed in certain ways no matter if we try not to or not. You can do mental exercises all you want to gain a fresh perspective but no matter what there will be remnants of whatever you used to do built in to your &#8220;new&#8221; way. Those remnants can be subtle or not so subtle but they will be there. They will probably never go away even if you concentrate hard of making them do so. Of course you can develop new stuff as well but some of the old stuff will still be there flavoring the new stuff for better or worse.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s take a couple of examples that I am extremely familiar with. Lens focal length being the first. I grew up on prime lenses. First off because that&#8217;s all I had when I started and what I tended to gravitate to in the early 80&#8217;s. When I got a new camera system, the hasselblad, there was ONE zoom lens that was horribly expensive and continued to shoot with a very common trio. A 50, 80, 150 trio to be specific - a little different than my 35mm stuff but not too too much different.</p>

<p>Somewhere along the way I picked up my first zoom lens - a Nikon 28-70 F2.8 AFS. Big heavy and the only thing it had going for it was that it focused very very fast compared to the non-AFS primes I had. I still have that lens and it is still very good but without fail I use it like two lenses that I can change very very quickly. On a full-frame body it is a 28 and a 70. Sort of a wide and sorta-normalish. On a DX body it&#8217;s a normal and a short tele. I can tell you from hundreds of thousands of images in Aperture that it is always at 28 or 70 and nowhere in between.</p>

<p>When I think about that after having the indisputable evidence of the EXIF in my face, I can see myself wracking the zoom ring and then moving my position by increments back and forth for framing vs. using any zoom adjustment. Heck I still use my Panasonic LX5 the same way - it&#8217;s a camera with a 24 and a 90 unless I think about it real real hard and set it to something in between. I am not saying it&#8217;s good or bad but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going away. Contrast this to the person that grew up on zooms. I see them all the time. They bring the camera to their eye and fiddle with the zoom to frame.</p>

<p>So what, you may ask. Well, I guess the point is somewhat tangential to a few things I have been harping on for sometime under the guise of shooting film. Specifically about shooting simple cameras that were par for the course in the film era. Want to gain some perspective into your shooting? Maybe change it up a bit? Shoot a different camera with a different medium like film that operates with a completely different set of rules. A couple of things my happen from this exercise. First you may get really frustrated. Second you may uncover some conditioning that you didn&#8217;t even realize you had when you are forced to operate differently. Third if you stick with it for long enough you may develop some new habits that will bleed over to other equipment you choose to use that will inform your process and possibly your images down the road.</p>

<p>Just something to think about on a windy crappy Saturday - well at least where I am on the planet at this moment.</p>
